    Well, Hello 
 
I thought i should stop writing reviews but after watching this anime i had to change my mind. 
I have never been so jacked up about an anime like this before.. So i am compelled to write this review down. 
 
So this anime is the sequel and continued story of ""Emma - A Victorian Romance"" I will remind you in short. It was about a rich guy named William and a commoner girl maid named Emma. They both falls in love at first sight. But the main problem was their classes in society. This anime was set in England. 
 
I want to tell you the truth, i started watching this just as a trial coz i didn't had anything to watch and as soon as i watched its first episode (season 1's first episode), i went crazy all over the show, i was looking for something like this for so long, The best thing i like is the story and character behavior, its unlike anything i have ever seen throughout any anime out there until today. It is truly more than a masterpiece for me. 
The hardships they took to obtain true love is shown in a very good manner. Up until now clannad and after story was my best, now i would say this is something even better.... 
 
Art is OK, if u see Emma carefully, you will find her to be an absolute beauty. Without her optics and unpinned hairs, she just looks like a princess, although Williams art could use some finishing touch, but anyway they seem a pretty nice couple together. So i think the art is perfected already. 
 
The main thing is the story and the character behavior as i have mentioned earlier, I am just unable to express my feelings towards this anime in mere words.  
 
One last thing i would like to say, no matter how much good i say about this anime, but i think those words can never be enough to describe how much perfected masterpiece this anime is...  
  
 
Good luck and Thank you

    What do you get when you take 1930's gangsters, mix in sorcerers who have created the Elixir of life, sprinkle in an Assassin, a psychopath, 2 hilarious thieves, a young bootlegger and his crew, a young Cappo, a train heist by 2 different groups and 3 different storylines that cover a 3 year period, oh and the Devil? One Hell of an anime! Baccano is what you would get if Quentin Tarrantino made an anime. A story with no main characters! Baccano follows here story lines that span from 1930-1933. It can be confusing and I recommend that you pay attention to the beginning of each episode or when the story changes it will tell you what year it is. This will help you with where you are in the story! As confusing the 1st three or four episodes may be it seriously pays off in episodes 11-13 where all three storylines converge! This series is one Hell of a ride and also has one of the best rewatchable factors of any anime out there. Also as much as Cowboy Bebop gets praise for being the gold standard for Dub anime, Baccano is up there! The actors, from Housten, TX create a fantastic 1930's new York sound. You literally feel like  your watching a gangster movie from that era! Its Baccano's fresh take on story telling that makes it one of my all time fave series! I've been watching anime for just overt 30 years now. As this is my 1st Review, 1st of many I assure you. I plan to hone my reviewing style over the coming weeks as I review series after series! So in closing. If you looking for an Adult anime with fresh and original story telling, with wild violence and one of anime's most famous Assassins, I cannot recommend BACCANO enough! It's my go to for seinen anime! In my opinion it was the best anime to come out of 2007! which is known as probably the most famous year in anime history, as such juggernauts as Death Note and Code Geass aired the same year! There are also 3 OVA's that relatively end the series and they do come with the DVD and Blue ray sets! Let me know what you thought of BACCANO and if you have never seen it, I hope this will get you to give it a try! Peace Luv hand grenade! Monty!

    Kuttsukiboshi can perhaps be attributed to a bench. You sit on it and wait for something to happen. While sitting, you are more open to the world around you, physically or emotionally. Usually, things transpire while sitting. And at times you ponder on what is happening. But it doesn't last for long, because usually you only stay on a bench for a small amount of time. 
 
Story: 7/10 
Considering that it's only composed of two episodes, Kuttsukiboshi's plot is pretty linear. It's understandable for something that lasts only a little above forty minutes. Instead of delivering plot twists however, Kuttsukiboshi brings shock, which isn't very common in shoujo-ai/yuri. The story is centered on the couple Saitou and Kawakami. Looking at them, you would somewhat expect that there would be a misunderstanding between them that pulls them apart. But the events that actually pull them apart were unexpectedly...appalling. The result of that: what seems to be cruel in reality, happens. 
 
At some parts though, the drama between Kawakami and Saitou felt rushed, as was their succeeding resolution. At one point, you'd wonder ""what just happened?"", and realize you'll never get an answer. Simply because Kuttsukiboshi was made to be simple, but often at the wrong time. 
 
Oh, and lots of love making. Not that that's a bad thing. 
 
Art: 6/10 
Produced by Primastea, infamous for the Isshou Training series, you wouldn't expect much. Yet what looks to be flawed turned out to be actually acceptable. Although every scenery, person, love scene, or bench, doesn't live up to 2010-2012 standards, the style used gives the ambiance of a world isolated to two girls. That's pretty vague... 
 
Without looking at the deeper meaning of style, one can say that Kuttsukiboshi may have been done a little slower than a rush. Painted sceneries and objects look decent but look lazily done at close inspection. Character designs aren't the best; passable but unique.. One thing that may bother the viewer is the awkward smoothness of the camera at times, but can be overlooked. In short, it's not perfect, but at the very least decent. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
The soundtrack is appropriate, as was the use of the piano. Calming most of the time. Not much can be said here. 
 
Character: 6/10 
Unfortunately, not much back story was given for Kawakami and Saitou. The benefit of this is that what is told to you is relevant to the story, so you aren't lead off-track. The character development was done in a simple manner: conflict, resolution, change. Although the ""change"" was in a way unimpressive and out-of-the-blue, it could be called ""sweet"", considering that this is shoujo-ai. You are given little internal monologue and so you wouldn't know what led a character to such decision (although you can be assuming and just say, ""it's love""). 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
There are two reasons why I enjoyed Kuttsukiboshi. The first: love scenes that are short, sweet, and not explosive. The second: the ""shocking moments"" I mentioned earlier. It left my mouth gaping for at least half a minute. Depending on your tastes and expectations, enjoyment will vary. 
 
And so you leave the bench, wondering how what happened affected you. Kuttsukiboshi is, bluntly, not what you'd expect (on a positive and negative note), but is definitely one of the better shoujo-ai anime there is.

    Pros  
+Art Style is Beautiful  
+Animation is Flawless  
+Battle Sequences Are Immaculate   
+Characters Are Well Developed 
+Great Plot  
+I could go one forever with pros  
 
Cons  
-Pacing of the Show is a little slow to begin with  
 
My Opinion  
So let me preface this by saying this is my favorite anime by a long shot so my view of the show is clearly going to be a positive one but bear with me and ill explain why it is my favorite. 
  
With Fate/Zero gaining a lot of attention from being the prequel to Fate/Stay Night it had a lot of hype to live up and let me tell Tight moon meet everyone of them for me without a doubt. 
  
The art style is really what sold it to me right off the start, it was simply incredible and put simply just very well done. Watching a battle sequence was like watching a triple A movie it was just gripping and some of the fights had to sitting on the edge of your seat. 
  
The plot is also superb and exciting for the most part, what i will say as it one weakness is that in places it had some poor pacing and could have lead the viewer to get a little bored and a lot that is right at the start where there are explaining a lot of the characters and the backdrop of the show. 
  
Characters development like a lot of things in this show is fantastic, as i said sometimes they would dwell on the details for a little too long but when you characters as badass as Saber, Emiya, Kiritsugu and Kotomine, Kirei you don't mind the extra detail. I could sit hear a go though each character and tell you why i liked each one of them but that wouldn't be a review that would be me having a fangasm. What i say is that you will love character, hate characters and it just makes the whole show just so much better 
  
So should you watch this show? YES. Why haven't you watched this yet? It   reignited my love for anime no doubt 
 
Hope my review was helpful

    Story - Poor. Normally I watch a mystery anime for two things. A sense of resolution, or the satisfaction of a mystery solved. Even the most amateur mystery story can be enjoyable once the tricks are revealed.  
 
But Un-go is different. None of the stories have a decent resolution, because while the mysteries are always solved, they were always covered up. Which defeats the purpose of mystery genre completely. The true genre of Un-Go is waste of time. Because that is what the characters are doing. Searching for truth, but have no real interest in revealing the truth. Hence wasting time.  
 
Furthermore, the plot is weak. In the first story, the victim was killed so that he died a hero, while he really was not. But after the killer was found, it was announced that he was a hero anyway to protect his name. There was no point in killing him in the first place. In the second story, the victim was killed because her daughter wanted to be a singer and the victim did not permit her. But the daughter was unable to become a singer anyway because of some random conspiracy by the government against idol bands. Which she was never a part of. So she killed her mother for no reason. In the third story, ""omg, the only other person in the room is not the killer, its a curse."" How stupid is that? And when the story goes on, it is revealed the victim was killed because he was a spy and broke into the house. But of course the killer was guilty of... self defense and was arrested anyway. And for a crime they did not have proof of. Aside from the detective saying ""he did it.""  
 
For the three stories shown so far, not a single character has become better off. Not the victim, not the killer, not the victim's family, nor the killer's family. All three crimes can be described as unnecessary. The fact that the crime was done has in no way changed the lives of any of the characters. I'm not even sure if the first 2 killers were arrested because the police told them that the crime is going to be attributed to an innocent scapegoat, for the reason that... no reason. And the 3rd killer was arrested, even when no real proof was linked to him. No, circumstantial evidence, even when strong, is not the same thing. There is NO link at all.  
 
Aside from these, there is no satisfaction in watching the mystery being solved... because OMG OMG there is MAGIC in a futuristic, scientific, post apocalyptic world. But the catch is, only the main character has access to it. And no one even notices it, and just accepts the sudden random confessions. And ignores the random ""I want to eat him/eat his soul"" comments. There is nothing to make you think, ""oh so that's why the main character caught the culprit,"" or ""oh so that's why he's even suspected in the first place."" Although it's not hard to point the real killer within 5 minutes of the show for the first 2 stories, because they're both cliched.  
 
The police are bumbling idiots, and the only other detective aside from the main character is a meddling civilian, whom, when the police ask ""how can we identify the corpse,"" answers ""do a DNA test."" Duh.  
 
Characters - Shit. Main character is an expressionless background character. And his most memorable line is ""there is no use in lying, no one can evade answering [my assistant because he has magic]."" Big whoop. And he doesn't seem to care one way or another about the truth which is a rather odd trait for a detective. He butts his way into a case, wastes his entire day being a background character, miraculously solves the case, and let the lie be accepted as the truth anyway. Then he closes off each case with ""people are ugly inside."" End.  
 
The other main character is an annoying brat. He does random stuff that only serves to distract you from the story. He should have been arrested 20x in 4 episodes just for tampering with evidence. And making physically impossible postures just to make the show creepier. But he changes into a woman who can force the truth out of someone. And eat souls.  
 
All the other characters are just as flat. A civilian meddler who is the ""best detective,"" but he hasn't actually solved a single case. Only covered everything with his lies to protect the... Dunno what. And his daughter who's single trait is contrariness. Tell her to do something and she won't.  
 
And the police who knows the main character actually solves cases look down on him because of it. Why should we respect a detective who actually solves cases? No, we must support the meddler who covers everything up because he is more popular. Let us not make the strong-arm police/detective who think he's always right. It's so cliche. Instead, let's just make her have a serious fan-girl adoration of someone who she knows is wrong all the time. Oh, and as I mentioned earlier, how DO you identify someone? By DNA duh.  
 
Give me goth lolis any day. At least they actually have a personality. Even a stock character is better than a main character who is actually a background character. Even those annoying cicadas on trees they show every other episode in slice of lifes are more interesting.  
 
Art/Sound - Annoying. I normally don't comment on art and sound, because story/character/enjoyment are the things I find important. But the sound is ANNOYING. Whenever ""magic truth time"" starts, the background music suddenly becomes jarring. The first time, I thought my speaker broke. It's really annoying, distracting, and did I mention annoying? 
 
Enjoyment - Blah. I'd rather go to sleep than continue to watch this anime.  
 
Overall - Many words can be used to describe this anime. But the one that defines this the most is... ANNOYING. Annoying story, annoying plot, annoying characters, annoying background music. The fact that they use magic in a detective mystery is annoying. I normally watch a series even when its not that good, but I'm gonna drop this because it actually pisses me off.

    I have been watching Classroom of the Elite for a while now and...I kinda find it both enjoyable and somewhat disappointing at the same time. The review here is mainly written from my point of view as a reader who finished the original six volumes of the light novel, so my opinions would probably differ from some of the other reviewers. 
 
Plot: Classroom of the Elite centers around a ""power struggle"" between the four  
ranked classes (A,B,C, and D) in a prestigious, bizarre high school. The overall performance of each class influences their corresponding students' ""point"" income (an in-school currency used for all types of transactions) and potentially enables the lower-ranked classes to replace the higher ones, thus changing their ranks... 
 
As a regular anime, Classroom of the Elite is adequate for the mainstream audience. It has very good pacing, great art, and a plot that feels interesting and keeps you hooked. Some initially feel that the characters in the anime somewhat resembles the ones in SNAFU, but give it a few episodes and you would see the difference.  However, there are several aspects of the anime that greatly annoyed me when I was watching it, especially when I compared it to the original novel. 
 
First of all, the tone of the anime feels somewhat out-of-place. For the most part it takes itself seriously, so serious that these mundane conflicts between classes actually mildly resemble gang rivalries. Yet on the other hand, it sometimes places too much emphasis on fanservices and/or employ tropes commonly seen in high school love comedy shows.  As far as the original novel is concerned, such tropes never appeared, and rather annoyingly made the relationship between the main characters seem much more intimate than they should be, which doesn't help the overarching atmosphere.  Another problem I've had with this adaptation is how it doesn't stay true to the original work. Hell, Suzune even got a scene that was originally another character's. I can only hope that the production team behind it foresaw the narrative consequences of that. 
 
In the end, I would say give this anime a try. If you like it, then you would probably feel it's very good and continue watching it. If not, then just drop it and nothing of value is lost. I hope this review has been, at the very least, mildly informative to you.

    I've never seen something so disgustingly bad, and that's coming from someone that somewhat enjoyed the other isekai anime this season. For starters, I'm not a huge fan of harems or fan service, but I can look past both if the story is good and the show has some substance. Sadly this does not, it's so incredibly boring and EXTREMELY awkward. The MC just comes across as some sick disgusting pervert, making anyone he defeats submit to him and either become his ""child"" or ""sister."" I would literally rather watch paint dry than watch another second of this crap.  
 
Let me serve as an example for you, don't waste your time with this crap.

    this is the first review that i made so please be gentle with me. 
 
well, when the episode started, i said ""whoa! i thought this is different"". but as the story continues, i realized why it started like that. 
 
I didn't like the art that much, but it is enough for the story though. it was very quiet and calm that it makes me feel the seriousness of the situation (though you can clearly hear her moans! haha). i really admire how the characters behave throughout the episode. the boy's gentleness and the girl being innocent on what their doing. the story just focused on the couple's FIRST and i think that is enough for you to enjoy it.  
 
 
Overall, i really enjoyed watching this. simple but relaxing. it has no harsh scenes like any other hentais. haha. it's sex with LOVE. :)

    Never has a change in the animation studio been this apparent to me. That was essentially my first thought as I tried up to sum up my feelings about Date A Live. The main reason why I started watching this anime was because someone I know has it in her favorites list and I thought to myself 'eh. Why not.'... So I watched the first season and was pleasantly surprised. Harem anime have been some of my least favorite in the past, so I expected this one to be fairly similar... but honestly, the first season of this anime was really, really good. Mainly because it managed to escape quite a chunk of the normal things that harem anime go through, while still putting a spin on the things that it did do like almost every other harem out there. One scene that's still stuck with me is the Onsen episode in the first season, which was genuinly funny and was something I hadn't even remotely witnessed before. So after that first season, my expectations for the second season were quite high... and as you might've guessed from the very first sentence and my rating, I was thoroughly disappointed. 
 
So why's that?? Well, mainly because the second season was missing both the cleverness and the heart of the first one... though it started out promising. The first episode felt just like something from the first season... but from the second episode onward, everything went straight down. Just like the first season, there was an Onsen episode here... but unlike back then, this one was just a plain, generic and unfun one, which would go on to set the tone for the remainder of the anime. The somewhat unique setting of the MC going on dates with characters and being 'supported' by a team of 'professionals', choosing his answers Visual Novel style was replaced by dull drama and fights that just weren't interesting whatsoever; the interesting characters of the first season (especially Yoshino) were put on the bench in favor of new characters that turned out to be as lively and engaging as a round of chess on a graveyard and the humor that gave the first season its charm was replaced by one-dimensional characters pretending to hav serious conversations during silly Mecha-suit fights... so in short, everything that made the first season stand out was switched out for generic things that are about as unique as water in Atlantis. 
 
That said, it wasn't ALL bad (otherwise my score would've been even lower)... As mentioned above, the first episode was still really, really good and also there was a brief part during the beginning of the second arc where the humor of the first season flashed up again, when he had to dress up as and pretend to be a girl in order to get close to a spefic girl. Also on the rare occasions that the other characters from the first season DID show up, their personalities were kept intact, which was something I had feard would not be the case ('Dark Tohka' notwithstanding). Another thing that the second season did was make me realize just how good the first one had truly been, causing me to retroactively change my rating for that season from 7 to 8 points (which is something I almost never do. Once I've finished a season of an anime, I normally don't touch the score anymore). 
 
So in the end, what I'm trying to get at here is that the second season was just completely lacking the heart, genius and charm of the first one and just felt like something that was thrown together with minimal effort just to rake in as much money as possible. Maybe it's just coincidential that there was this huge of a difference in quality once it was produced by a different studio, but I personally don't believe that. Especially since Production IMS is a studio that likes to put out low-effort harem anime (see also 'Hundred' and next season's 'Masou Gakuen HxH') 
 
So... that was it for my first review here. To be honest, I've always wanted my first review to be either my favorite anime (Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai) of all time or my least favorite one (Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji), but the jarring difference in quality between these two seasons just made me want to open my stupid mouth in order to complain a bit. To anyone that's still reading this, thank you for doing so... and sorry for making you read this shit ^^'. Anyhow, have a wonderful day (or night, who knows) and make sure not to fall for scammers. Goodbye! :D

    Never in a million years did I think I would enjoy a series in terms of it being about a doctor on a journey to solve a mystery, I thought for me I would of been bored within the first two episodes. How wrong I was, from the moment the first episode started and we have the religious text come up I knew I was in for something special and this became more apparent when I saw just how much was set up without having to be said. Monster is one of those series that grips you and never let's go. 
 
Story 
 
The story of Monster follows Dr Tenma who is working in German for a very high regarded hospital and once he learns about the corrupt dealings he chooses to save the life of a young boy over the mayor and as soon as the mayor dies he is shunned by the people in charge, but when those people die he is flung right back to the top but is labelled the prime suspect in the murders. Years later and Dr Tenma finds out who the killer is and it's a discovery he wish he had never found out. Now Tenma must go on the run and find out more about the monster who is causing German to turn into a country of chaos and who is turning into the next Hitler.  
 
To say more about the story of Monster would ruin it, it is a series that has to be seen to believe. At 74 episodes it may seem a bit long and a bit boring to some people but overall this series is meant to reflect a very realistic style of story telling and there are times in life where it is boring and long winded but that makes all the more exciting moments more exciting and when action happens it gives you a sense of rush that when the slow moments come in again after that rush it feels like it fits as you will need at times to take a break from all of the intense moments that happen in the story. So for me I felt that the slower moments were needed in order to keep the audience from getting an over rushed feel of emotion and it helps for the audience to let these emotions sink in. 
 
Overall when it comes to story, this story is complex always moving, always having the right balance of exciting action but slowly and quiet moments and just allowing the audience to see the characters as characters and allow the audience to grow an attachment to them. 
 
10/10. 
 
Characters 
 
When it comes to characters, again never have I had more attachment to a cast of characters like the cast of Monster, what I find most exciting is that every character is used in just the right amount, not too little and not too much and there are times in the narrative where certain main characters (Tenma included) will disappear from the story but this also gives us a chance to catch up with other major players and see the role that they are playing in the mystery, this I feel is a smart move as it gives the story as sense of an ensemble world and makes the audience excited for seeing these characters again rather then overexposing them. What really makes this cast so wonderful is all there different personalities and interactions with everyone and how everything ties back into the main theme of the story of what is the monster.  
 
Speaking of which the most amazing thing for me is that every character in the story that we see is influence by the two main characters those Being Tenma and Johan and how everything and everybody always comes back to these two characters and makes everyone connected however remote which helps make the story that much more grand and epic in own way. Even though some characters don't appear till later in the story they still come in a feel like they belong and their characters help to drive the story to it's final epic climax. All the characters really get their chances to shine and even the minor characters allow themselves to be memorable thanks to them being written well and having larger then life personalities. 
 
However to talk about each and every character in great detail would take me as long as a dissertation at university which is a shame as I would of loved to have done a dissertation ""which in a sense is a book"" on this fantastic series. So I will be brief in talking about the six main players of this story, those being Tenma, Johan, Nina, Lunge, Eva and Dieter. I'll start with Dieter. 
 
Dieter starts off as a young man who is being treated in a similar way to many of the children of the past and when Tenma sees this he helps him escape this hell in his in. Afterwards he becomes a companion and a sidekick to Tenma, even though Tenma wants him not to follow him and for a large portion he doesn't follow Tenma but it's this companionship that helps Dieter help other children who were like him to see Tenma's view and without Dieter I think Tenma would be a completely different person. 
 
Eva starts off as engaged to Tenma however when her father is killed and she blames Tenma for it she drops of the wagon and becomes a hateful woman who can't see anything good in the world and just drinks herself to death. Once she realizes Tenma's innocence she starts to pull her act together and seeing how some people will help her regardless of what she thinks of them really helps her to turn her life around and become a much better person. When I started watching Monster she was my least favorite character mostly because she just wined and moaned about everything yet thanks to the story and how she changed over the course of the series she became a much better character and one that I didn't end up hating in the end. 
 
Lunge is an inspector for the Bka and the man who becomes a rival to Tenma thinking that he is responsible for the murders that are happening in Germany and how he created Johan through a split personality. Lunge is cold and calculating and can accurately pin point information and details into his brain or hard drive as he calls it. He lives for his work so much that eh doesn't even care when his family leaves him. He works like a computer to the point that he tries to convince himself his word is final and no matter what, even if the truth is starring him in the face he will never accept that his word is wrong. However when it becomes apparent of who is really behind the chaos in Germany he is force to accept for the first time in properly his career that he is wrong and sets about to bring about an end to the chaos in his own way. 
 
Nina Foritner is Johan Libert's twin sister and is one of the main protagonists after Tenma, I won't say why they have different names as that will spoil one of the major plot points of the series. Nina starts off as an average girl living with her parents, however when memories of her past start to catch up with her she along with Tenma go to try and solve the mystery of her past and what happened and through her interaction with Tenma becomes a more stronger person and through her interaction with Dieter is able to stay grounded in who she truly is. She eventually with Tenma's help is able to confront her brother about their past, again what makes it so amazing is how the story can take these characters and through them in certain situations and how they change and Nina is no different, seeing the horrors of what her brother does is what truly inspires her to dig into her past and find her brother so that she can put an end to his reign of terror. Nina is probably my second favorite female protagonist and probably in my top three characters in Monster. Now we get to talk about my two favorite characters. Tenma and Johan. 
 
Tenma is the main character and in my opinion the greatest anime character of all time. The reason being is that he is confronted with ideals and beliefs that are out of his element yet he still always tries to do the right thing yet even then he is still human and never lets the fact that certain people do horrible things keep him from making them suffer a little yet despite that he will try and help them as best he can. Throughout the series he always has the mandate that all life is equal and no one no matter how bad they have become deserve to die as he always believes that it's never to late to start over and make a fresh start and this mandate of his is what truly made me excited about following him and seeing him grow because he does see the corruptions around him and he is forced to do things that in the past he wouldn't of done but that's what makes him truly a hero the fact that he still holds on to his believe that no one deserves to die but he does have to do things that go against that sometimes and he isn't a perfect person but he is never the less still a person and a good person who will try to pull through impossible odds and when he is being told he is going to be arrested or told that nobody wants his help he still helps them and tries his best to save people and always show them a different way of life and throughout the story I always felt he made the right choice and even after seeing Johan do unspeakable things he still treats Johan like a person and chooses to save him yet again because he can't bring himself to end another person's life no matter what and that is inspirational to me that fact that he becomes a hero starting off as a simple man and to give me that belief that everyone shouldn't be treated any differently even if they are considered evil. But above all I feel his greatest strength comes in his desire to simple never give up on anyone. I love Tenma because of how he holds on to his humanity through the story and how he shows me the true value of sticking to what you believe in even though others around you are telling you otherwise and how you can't just give up on someone. 
 
And now we get to talk about the main villain and the reason why this manga/anime is here Johan Libert. If you want to talk terrifying complex and damaged characters look no further. Johan really is a true psychopath in every sense of the word and this comes down to the fact that he is so harmless on the surface but that is all a disguise for a heart that is as black as a black hole in space and a mind which is even sharper then Guts's sword from Berserk. Johan makes people trust him and then kills them in certain ways depending on how he is feeling, Johan's overall goal is to kill as many people as possible to become the last person at the end of the world and see the world unfold into a rave of chaos and destruction. He tries to get Tenma and others to shot him so that the monster in him will turn to them and they will become monsters themselves. Johan simply can be considered the one character that you would never suspect of doing anything wrong which makes it all the more shocking when things are damaged by his hands. Johan kills for himself and nothing more and sees it as just a part of his life and let's face it when people are calling you the monster, the devil and the next Hitler all at the same time, you know you are not to be messed with under any circumstances. Johan is one truly terrifying character and that fact that even at the end we still don't know much about him makes it even more scary. Plus because he hardly appears in the story makes it even more shocking when he does pop up and the way people talk about him and how every murder is orchestrated by him and the longer he is around the more people die makes him a psychopath on a grand scale. Tenma sees life as equal, Johan sees life as nothing, perfect definition of two sides of the the same coin and really makes for a battle of the minds and every time he appeared in the story or even when a event was brought up because of him I got a sense of dread and despair which I have never felt before. Johan is truly the greatest anime villain and possibly the best villain of all time from his actions and shadowy presence throughout the story. 
 
With a rich cast that will have at least one character anybody will fall in love with Monster makes great use of an ensemble a rich complex cast that is of epic nature.  
 
10/10. 
 
Now when it comes to sound, the music fits really well with the intense moments and the nice quieter moments and that's all I can say, plus the opening song is one of the best ever. My personal favorite tracks are the one used in the final episode for when the articles about Tenma are being read for it's triumphant nature and Johan's theme for reason I don't need to example. The music fits well with a lot of stand out tracks that give the series a very real sense of the situations that go on. When it comes to voice acting I feel that Monster's dub gives a much better listen then the Japanese version. I know many people might think differently but I feel this dub falls with Cowboy bebop and Full metal Alchemist. Primarily because of the main cast, Lunge sounds more robotic in the English which is true of the character and Johan in the dub sounds much more colder and sinister then the Japaneses voice actor, plus at the end of the series I feel like the voice for Tenma really feels like he has gone on this long epic journey. The Japanese cast is great don't get me wrong and the sub is a fantastic listen I just feel the dub captures the impact of the manga much more. 
 
So sound wise the music and voice acting once again is top notch.  
 
10/10. 
 
Now we come to the last parts, the arts style really gives off some memorable moments and makes great use of it's setting. Being set in Germany it allows for the use of a lot of great areas to explore ranging from the hospital at the beginning of the series to the vast open landscape. Each setting allows the artwork to expand and become a character itself, when we enter a new setting it is drawn differently and gives off it's over unique feel which allows the audience to not be bulked down on repeated usage of scenery and allows us to connect to each of the location and give a sense that this a huge story. Also when it comes to the characters the art style allows them to act as normal people and be expressed like normal people which helps with the realistic nature of the story.  
 
With some memorable locations that are capture on a drawing and very realistic characters the artwork is a treat for the eyes and never let's your eyes see two locations that are drawn the same. 
 
10/10 
 
When it comes to enjoyment of the series for me personally as you've probably figured out, Monster is my favorite anime/manga/any tv show ever. My reason I have already explained and every time I watch it I get this sense that I have always been on a experience to a place with a vast landscape and it makes me want to visit that place and travel around it and being set in the real world I can do that. Monster helps me to see the best in humanity as well as the worst and makes me satisfied when i do see the best in humanity win the day without the use of violence all the time.  
 
Overall Monster is a series that just gets me filled with so many emotions. I maybe a little long winded for some people but I am not one of those people and it allows me to feel like I am there sharing these experience with the characters as they are going through the experience too. With powerful characters an epic storyline and a great enjoyable experience. Monster is my favorite all time series period. Nothing has and nothing will again grip me like this epic series did. 
 
10/10 for a masterpiece in animation and anime history.

    ""My heart is being torn apart right in front of me, but everything seems to be my fault!!!"" 
 
white album 2 is what appear to us as your typical adaptation of any other VN out there where to us will look like normal and not wanting to watch!! 
 
well i'll make it short White Album 2 (WA2) is one of those romance anime that catapult to top spot because of it's realism and outstanding animation, voice actors/tress, wonderful OP/ED and songs that will make you feel relax  
 
it tackle what love really is?  
who to love? 
who to betray? 
 
this highlights that there is a fine line between friendship and love, love and betrayal!  
 
character development and characters are very likable and well written! 
 
story is unique (like most of the people here i was wrong i thought this is like a remake of White album which is wrong totally wrong! ) 
 
9/10 because of the ending well the anime is 1/3 of the total story (the anime series is part of the Introductory Chapter (IC) the nxt part is the Closing Chapter adn the last part is the Coda part).

    This is going to be some-kind-of-review. I just had the need to write something about an almost 40-year-old anime. Oh yeah, pardon my poor English. 
 
Humanity lives in space colonies in order to reduce Earth's overpopulation. Mobile Suit Gundam is a story about war between Earth Federation and Principality of Zeon – the side who separated itself from the Earth Federation and started the war. To keep it short, the story begins from the Side 7 space colony, which is heavily attacked by Zeon. In order to evacuate, Earth Federations space ship called White Base needs civilians to operate - so to say the main character Amuro Ray and couple of other survivors. 
 
When escaping Amuro uses Federations secret weapon – Gundam mecha robot - to save himself and the others. These civilians need soon learn how to fight in order to stay alive and face Zeons forces. They are not given any other options, but as you may guess this inexperienced crew grow stronger and united in the heat of war. Our normal 15-year-old main character Amuro is given the heavy responsibility to fight in Gundam and protect White Base, because in the beginning he’s the only one capable of piloting this mecha robot. 
 
I found Mobile Suit Gundam very entertaining and amazing series, so much I couldn’t stop watching it. One of the best things in this anime is that all crew members really are amateurs (amateurs at different levels at least) and civilians at the beginning. Because it’s about war, there naturally were battles over battles over battles. However, story is compelling and it begins to turn really interesting towards the end. Especially when there’s rumors about “Newtypes” – but it’s only a bit shame it took 30 episodes to get there, because I think it’s natural how things take time to develop (just like in the real life). 
 
Characters were nicely made. They all have their meaning, story and history behind them... it was easy to grow fond to them. They grew within the story, made mistakes, were scared about the war and sensitive about how it made them feel. So to say they were like real human beings. War changed them and made them realize what is so important to keep fighting for. They had their own drama’s, which kept this anime interesting. 
 
Animation is like you think it would be for a 36-year-old anime – greatly aged like a wise old man. So yes, compared to this day visuals are clumsy and very simple.. but nevertheless really awesome, as I think personally. It had great, rough and nicely nostalgic feel to it. Gundam is a classic and great piece of anime history, but the enjoyment is based on viewer’s personal liking. I’d advise you to be open-minded when watching. Old fashioned voice effects were just icing on the top and I think voice actors made a good job. When you know how old this anime is, old animation style didn’t really matter – it just made the whole anime much better. Battle scenes were actually pretty good and war tactics detailed. There were a wide range of places where the battles occurred. 
 
Hmm.. the line between good and bad didn’t seem so strict, although many would say Zeons are the “bad guys”. But you can’t really say either side is just evil or pure and innocent. Both Federation and Zeon had soldiers with families, children and fears between them, and they believed their own actions would lead to a better world. Neither side was spared from tragedies. I must say it was hilarious when one of Zeons captains just calmly asked more coffee during a large scale battle, so yeah, it was easy to like some sassy Zeons too. It’s true that continuous fighting took a lot of attention, but I got the feeling that this story didn’t really lack anything. There were everything between romance and conspiracy and false friendship. So to say – much to swallow, but the story remained coherent. 
 
Mobile Suit Gundam is like the mother (or father lol) of all mecha anime. I surely recommend it to all because c’moon, it’s like a general education in anime world. ;)

    First thing first, an AWESOME anime. You'll definitely wanna watch this. 
 
An anime about terrorism. I thought it would be some guys reeking havoc in the city using bombs, guns, tanks etc. But this is completely different. 
This anime is more based on a detective and thinking approach. 
Yes, there are some explosions in the series but that's not what it is about. 
It's a very enjoyable series. 
It's starts off a bit slow but after a couple of episodes, it gets you absorbed in it. 
The character designs is awesome. Nine must be the coolest teen I've seen in anime yet. 
The story is indeed awesome. I've seen nothing like this before. And the detective side of the anime is pretty neat. Makes you guessing who the bad guys really are till the end. 
But this is must watch series. If you like serious, thriller, detective type anime with some thinking, this is one for you no doubt. 
 
Overall: Loved it. And an awesome ending for an awesome anime. No sequel expected.

    My first review. 
I didn't plan to watch it in first place, but so many people have recommend it to me, so i gave it a chance. Here is what I thinking about it. 
Story: 8 
First of all the story is simple, but it's good. In my opinion it has a great potential, however it wasn't exploited all of it. The mysteries wasn't so deep and dark as I have expected. 
Art: 6 
The art is general good, the characters were ok and the background pretty. As a matter of fact is don't fits here, the colors are way too bright and all of the characters looks for me funny because of the genre of it. 
Sound: 10 
Simply amazing. The music were beautiful and the voice actors were great too.  
Characters: 4 
All characters were so... boring. I didn't even started to like them a bit. For me they were only a decoration.  
Enjoyment: 5 
Consequently for what i have written about the characters, I wasn't able to enjoy it so much. Therefore there were so scenes who I have really enjoyed the show. 
Overall: 6 
To putt it  in a nutshell,  it wasn't great show, but it was fine. I was a little annoyed of the art and the characters, but it wasn't so bad.

    I've been waiting for this movie for quite a long time, and I have only watched it recently since I couldn't get my hands on it no matter how hard I tried. And I have to say I am complete satisfied. My several months of want have been completely satiated in a matter of 2 hours. And that was 2 hours very much well spent. 
 
I'm impressed with the way the movie progressed really. I couldn't have thought of a better setting. Set after the four girl's university exams to their farewell ceremony, which was the last episode as well. The gang decides to have a short before-graduation vacation to Europe while they think of something special to leave behind for their dear Azu-nyan. 
 
The plot itself was very intriguing. The common elements of the anime were changed, but the all to common feeling that k-on gives was still there. And since they were in a different atmosphere, and a totally different country altogether, the enticing effect of surprise was also present. It gave off a totally new feeling, but still retained its whole self.  
 
The story telling was all in all, superb. I couldn't see any plot holes that weren't patched through. Although near the ending, it did kind of give off a rushed feeling. But it's not a big deal since it was technically part of the movie. They also managed to really capture London, not just in the art. They managed to put on the ""foreigner's"" point of view in a very nice and cute manner. 
 
Props to Kyoto Animation for their astounding work in the art department. I really like the texture of the movie. It really made the gang's ""moe-ness"" and fluffiness pop. The background details and the surrounding details were also exquisite. You can really see the effort they put in to each detail of the movie. 
 
And now what would K-ON be without the music? 
The music was also done pretty cleanly. Some of their old songs were featured, but none of the OP's and ED's. They also introduced new songs in the opening and ending as well. I am currently on the hunt of the MP3 of the OP. It's sooooo fluffy.... X3 
 
The seiyuus were also astounding as usual. They also had special English seiyuus as well. My favorite was the taxi driver. But some of the English seiyuus didn't really fit in though. But still, it was still pretty cool to see both languages in different perspectives. 
 
All in all, this has been one of the best anime movies I have ever seen. It's not just because of the cuteness of the gang and the hilariousness of their antics. It's also because it's one of the few anime that has actually touched me. It made me feel a strange but familiar feeling. A feeling I can only get by watching k-on. 
 
So yeah. That's about it. I recommend this movie to everybody, not just the otakus. Although you might want to actually see the entire series to make the experience even better, it's still a great watch on its own.

    *Spoilers in the Sound Section* 
Having just gotten into the whole of anime recently, I was curious to see why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the number one rated Anime on MAL. I considered watching the original series first, but ultimately just decided to jump into Brotherhood. While I'm not sure if I made the right choice (Still need to watch the original) I can safely say that this show is one of my favorites. Now, it is not my favorite, however, it was really close to being there. Unfortunately, it does possess some problems that I feel hold it back slightly, so let's jump into my review of FMA: Brotherhood.  
 
Story: 8 
I won't be comparing this to the original, as I have said, I haven't seen it, and from what I've heard, many of the first few episodes are better there. And I noticed the rushed pace, but many of the emotional moments still hit home. A number of character's deaths resonated hard with me. The rushed pace is something I felt fit well with the beginning, as it felt like Ed and Al's search was frantic, as opposed to later, which was slower thanks to having a focused goal. Whether this was intentional or not is something I don't know, but either way, I feel it fit well. The story suffered in that there were often just one too many events occurring. A tiny bit more focus on one scene would've, in my opinion, greatly improved the narrative. Also, I felt that at points, the story was either a tad too confusing (might have been since I didn't watch the original), or a tad too condescending. And those moments dragged me out of the narrative, however, those moments were mainly towards the end, and otherwise, I was left guessing what plot twist would occur, and it made it a hard show to put down 
 
Art: 10 
The art in the show is magnificent. From the opening (and we'll get to those opening), to the fight scenes, to the very art style of the show itself, I love it. The animation, when it isn't cutting away to CGI fans (which it does a surprising amount of times in the first part) is slick, sharp, and sweet. The thick lines and great colors were extremely well done. The CGI was mostly well done (I'm pretty sure it's CGI at least, not an expert on that), with the exception of a few small character and object moments. However, that is not enough to detract from undoubtedly one of the most beautiful shows out there, 
 
Sound: 10 
Holy cow the sound. It is absolutely amazing. Having some of my favorite openings in Anime history, some very memorable songs from within the show, and some very good audio mixing. There are two places I have major problems with the audio, however, and I know I'm nitpicking here, but honestly, I kinda have to do that with the sound. First, is the moment where Father is climbing up to Truth. He's going on about something, and despite rewatching that scene three times, I can barely make out what he's saying half of the time over the music. Which was annoying on two levels, one, I couldn't hear what might have been a very important diatribe, and I couldn't enjoy the fantastic music. The second moment is when a song didn't fit. When Al and Ed are coming back home, and Winry is coming outside, they play a really depressing song with the Latin Choir and everything, and it really doesn't fit. But other than those two, really annoying, moment the sound is outstanding 
 
Characters: 7 
The characters are, well, it's a mixed bag. You have Ed, Al, Mustang, Winry, Hawkeye, Hoenhiem, Armstrong, Ling, Lan Fan, May, Scar, most of the Humunculi, and even Father towards the end, which are all amazing and detailed characters. However, the series suffers due to a way too large side cast. The people of that automail town, most of the police force, all of the higher-ups, the Kameras, the dude who travels with Scar who is so forgettable I don't remember anything about him, despite him being there since part 2, and quite a few others. The shoehorning of these people into the narrative not only weakens it, but also weakens the characters. Development that could've been given to any of the good characters I mentioned was instead given to Lion dude, or what's his face. The strong characters are enough to keep this at a seven, but only a seven. Had just one of them not been executed well, this score would be a five or lower. 
 
Enjoyment/Overall: 9 
I'm condensing these two since I'm lazy and feel my enjoyment would be explained in overall either way. I binged this series on Netflix, and it was hard to put down. I would spend hours into the night, that I probably should've been sleeping, watching the show. I feel my enjoyment of the show was only diminished due to the internet. Now admittedly, this is my fault, but in my search for which show to watch first, I was spoiled to quite a few things about the show. That, kinda ruined the suspense at points. But still overall, amazing show, well worth the rating, probably should go watch the 2003 series now.

    A slice of life anime based off of people working as civil servants. Servant x Service explores the daily lives of the people working as civil servants and what they go through. There is no general plot but the show is wholesome and good. While watching this, this made me want to work as a civil servant in Japan. The romance in this isn't heavy but it is present and the comedy is very fair. A good anime that's only 13 episodes and definitely worth the watch. I personally enjoyed it very much and would rewatch if I had time.

    Well, I binge watched this whole anime and I have almost nothing good to say about it after finishing. The art style is pretty cool, I thought it was pretty good and I usually like this kind of art style, and it's got pretty solid voice acting. Buuuut that's pretty much where my enjoyment for it ends. 
 
Wow, I hated almost every single one of these characters. First of all, the main girl, Yui, is a little Mary Sue pushover that doesn't have an inkling of a personality let alone willpower. At first I felt bad for her but as the show went on, I completely lost all sympathy for her and she just began irritating me everytime I saw her. She does ABSOLUTELY nothing the entire show, even when she gets a chance to do something and change her situation, What does she do? Zip! I know that this was from an otome game and that's why she's pretty much a blank slate but it wouldn't hurt to make her likable or relatable.(sigh)  
 
Now let's talk about the so called ""vampires"". Now I have to admit I ended up liking one or two of them a little bit by the end of the show, but it just didn't help me like the show anymore overall, even with the two out of, what? Six? None of them had any character development to speak of, the prick that they were at the beginning of the show is the same prick they'll be at the ending, and most of them are just huge douchbags with no redeemable qualities, Why the hell am I going to root for them?(But then again I wasn't rooting for Yui either so.) Every time I think they're going to do something even a little nice, it's quickly erased by whatever they say or do next.1 step forward 5 steps back is the motto of this show.  
 
""I found the story really intriguing and couldn't get enough of it."" Is what I wish I could say here >,< I actually would talk about the story now if I thought there was one. It was just Yui getting passed around the guys like a bag of chips and a who could treat her the douchiest contest all up until the second or third to last episode. There wasn't any real story and the story at the end was so rushed and uninteresting that I forgot about most of it as soon as it was over. 
 
Many people told me that the game was a lot better than this so I looked into it and read about the story and characters on the game sites and wikia. I also watched some game clips, just cause I like to torture myself >.< But I have to agree with them, it seems like a pretty decent game from what I read and watched, so I don't know why this anime was so god awful. You know your anime has failed when reading about it online has more story and character development than watching it. So if you for some reason want to watch this I suggest playing the game and not wasting your time with this, you'll get a lot more out of it.

    I usually do not write before I finish watching a series with totality, or at least a full season, but I have been in need of writing about this 4th season of Shokugeki No Souma because I am not agreeing with the ones they are publishing and see necessary give my point of view on it. 
First it is necesary to clarify nobody has to tell them what to see and what not, that is a matter of each one, those who write here try to guide so that people have a different opinion or just one more. No one can come to impose their authority and tell you what is right and wrong. 
Second this fourth season of Shokugeki No Souma has the same style and I creativity as the previous ones, but above all the justifications of who wins and why the duel. It is obvious that we are no longer impressed by meals, but because we have been watching it for a long time, it is like the animation of Shingeki No Kyojin and his characters moving through the air, but the writing I think is still at the same level. 
The characters are so well constructed that it is logical and natural the decision they make at each moment. Duels are justified by those who win and who do not. When the rebels win there is a construction that exemplifies the story and how he knew how to take advantage of his virtues in front of a much higher rival in the roles, but when he wins the Elite they simply tell us that they are better than rebels and ready, and even if it seems forced or simplistic is right, of course they are the best of the prestigious Tootsuki. 
In summary, Shokugeki No Souma is still as good as before, perhaps the events and dialogues are somewhat rushed and the drawing is not completely detailed as we would like, but I think it is not an impediment to discredit so much this season that it is just as Good than the previous ones.

         Having watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series at a young age (the series itself came out in 2004, I believe), my twelve-year-old self was stoked when I found out that there was a reboot whilst screwing around on some anime chat room. The year was 2010. Needless to say, I ended up loving the show, even more than the original. All of my favorite characters had returned, and were just as badass as ever. But this anime needs more than a paragraph. It deserves more than that. There's a reason that people still discuss it, and the fanbase is just as fervent as when the show was airing all the way across the Pacific in good old Nihon. Or the Atlantic and all of Asia... Whatever. Same thing. 
 
Story:  Without getting too deep into the FMA:B storyline, the basic premise of the show involves two brothers who, accidentally (duh), forfeit their limbs and bodies in an attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy, which also happens to be a moral taboo. They then seek to find some way of restoring their lost humanity (and pride) by setting out on a journey in search of the fabled Philosopher's Stone. The story, of course, does not end there. But what fun would it be if I spoiled anything else? Alchemist's story manages to be engaging with, quite amazingly, zero baggage, even while clocking in at beefy 64 episodes. There is a clear purpose constant throughout each episode that never gets muddled or buried by another storyline. Everyone has their motives, and these motives propel the story forward. Some people might find the first few episodes somewhat rushed, as they cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. I assume that this is because much of said material was covered in the first series, which most viewers have typically seen. The pacing eventually evens out, however, when new material is introduced. The anime's story follows the original storyline of the manga, which the original veered away from about halfway through its runtime. And, in my opinion, the manga storyline is much better. There are too many differences to cover, and doing so would mean spoilers, but I will say that the ending in Brotherhood is perfect, much better than the original's mediocre one. 
 
Art and Animation:  The show is animated by Studio BONES (Soul Eater, Space Dandy, Eureka Seven, Wolf's Rain, Darker than Black, Gosick, Ouran). Those familiar with BONES know that it, when given a good budget, can rival any other studio in production quality. As with Brotherhood, the animation is wonderful. The art is very colorful, and the characters' features stand out amongst the backdrops. The show's visual quality is superior to the original, which is expected with a higher budget. As great as the art is, it isn't jaw-dropping.                                   
 
Sound: There's not much to talk about here. The soundtrack is perhaps a bit above average, and while it fits and benefits the show, it isn't something I would rush to purchase. The sound design (sound effects, etc.) is worth mentioning, as it brings the fast-paced alchemy battles and gunfire-laden battlefronts to life. Vic Mignogna's performance as Edward Elric in the English dub is also noteworthy.                                 
 
Characters:  This is the beef of the show (as with almost all good animes, imo). Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric reprise their roles as the main protagonists in Brotherhood, as well as all supporting protagonists. The villain cast, mainly comprised of mysterious apparitions named after the 7 Deadly Sins (if that doesn't make you want to watch the show, I don't know what will) returns for a second round at our heroes as well. As simple as it sounds, it's not quite so. For starters, there is a substantial amount of characters. It's not the most I've ever seen, and not all that tricky to keep track of (animes like Baccano!, for example), but viewers familiar with harem shows or other tightly-knit casts might be uncomfortable at first with the scale of Alchemist's world. But it's this scale and complexity that moves the show's pistons, all while elevating it above its competition. Not a single character is unnecessary, each one playing some form of role that completes the show. The chemistry between Ed and Al is vital not only for the show's plot, but for the emotional links necessary to keep a viewer interested in a 64 episode show. On the antagonist side, our villains possess just as much chemistry. Er, well, at least some of them... There are some characters whose presence also defies the typical good-vs-bad, and are not necessarily anti-heroes either. Their existence alone provides plenty of material, which, of course, relates back to the main plotline. None of the characters are annoying, which is perhaps the most amazing feat (most shows have at least one character that is obnoxious). Kudos to the writers on these characters. They could be the best I've ever seen. 
 
The Final Verdict:  Fullmetal Alchemist has been a huge staple in the anime world since 2004. After Brotherhood, it has become a legend. I always find it easier in hindsight to criticize shows and nitpick their flaws. As I grow older, I'm able to look back at shows that I loved as a kid and accept that they were not the pinnacle of entertainment (Dragonball series, Pokemon, etc.). Looking back at Brotherhood, however, only affirms what I thought of it as a preteen: one of the greatest series of any form of entertainment that I have ever viewed. The world of anime, as well as films, music, video games, and even politics is full of fads, things the “come and go”, as we commonly put it. Five years from now , Sword Art Online will be an obscure title that very few will remember or know about. It's been a decade since the original FMA aired in Japan, and many still discuss it. I anticipate that in the years to come, many will discuss Brotherhood, whether it's children mesmerized by the animation and color, teenagers in awe of the epic actions scenes, young adults enamored in the subtle romantic subplots, or adults impressed and intrigued with the complex chemistry between the characters.

    This anime in three words: stripping, guitar playing samurais. This pretty much sums up the whole series. But let me go into detail before you go hate on this series. 
 
First, the plot. Basically, it's set in the late Tokugawa period, where Shinsengumi was still a thing and rebels were everywhere. And what do you know? A hot guy takes a stand and fights against the current rule by... Rock? Seriously, it's like they played madlibs when they wrote the plot. They literally just swapped the current facts and placed crazy themes. I wasn't even sure if there was a plot. Everyone was just singing, like in a friggin' musical! Also, I don't think there was a need for them to strip every time they played a song. And I don't care if it's fanservice because it ruins the atmosphere. 
 
The characters were... detailed, at least in their design. Their personalities were mediocre, but their concept design wasn't bad. But other than that, they're just disposable. 
 
As it's a musical, it's expected that they play cool and memorable songs, right? Well, it's cool, I can tell you that. But memorable? Nah. 
 
Art style was okay. Abs were nicely detailed. No homo. 
 
In the end, I was left confused, thinking that it might have been the most cringe-worthy anime I've seen as of writing this review. If you like stripping, guitar playing samurais, then be my guest. But this anime did not rock on for me.

    First off, this is all my own opinion. But it's shared by most of the people who have seen the show. Also, this is going to be a LONG one.  
 
 
When I first heard about this anime, it seemed interesting. 
When people told me about the story, it seemed amazing. 
When people made me listen to the music, it seemed unbelievable. 
 
And let me tell you, it's all that and more. 
 
So it starts of with a baby trying to make a boy into the 10th head of a mafia gang.  
 
Now hold your horses and let me finish.  
 
While it may seem boring for the first 24-ish episodes (honestly, even those episodes gave me a good feeling), after that it dives off into a tale so epic, a story so full of amazing and loveable characters, soundtracks that give you the power to punch through a concrete wall, a true masterpiece. 
 
Story - 
 
As I said earlier, it's about a baby trying to make a boy into the 10th head of a mafia gang. Now let me explain this a bit. This ''baby'' is the number 1 hitman in the world, (hard to believe I know, but it's an anime what did you expect) The boy is the perfect example of a shounen protagonist; He's not the smartest, bad at sports and such a big clutz others call him No Good Tsuna. Oh also the usual ""I won't let you hurt my friends!'' stuff. However the change he makes is unbelieveable. He turns into such a badass it made me wonder why they could ever call him a good for nothing. 
 
There are plenty of arcs, and to each his own. However, it's not some random filler-like arcs, it's actually making progress throughout the series. 
 
Characters - 
 
There's a load of characters, and they're all amazing in their own way. Some are cool, some are funny, some are just outright badass. I'm sure everyone can relate to at least one character. There are, however, annoying characters. (I'm talking to you Lambo, I-Pin and Haru...) Ah, who am I kidding! Lambo may be a baby in a cow suit, wearing horns on his afro and having an arsenal bigger than Skyrims inventory in it aswell, he's just so loveable. And his transformations are also incredible. (20 years is all I'm going to say) I-pin might also be a baby, but she's a living bomb! A chinese, adorable living bomb! 'Nuff said. And Haru is just... Haru I guess. Can't really say anything good about her except for... uhh... nevermind I don't. 
 
The characters develop really well as the story progresses, working out flaws, becoming stronger and doing whatever they can for what they have to do. 
 
 
Sound -  
 
Unbelievable. From openings to epic fighting music to sad tracks, this anime has it all. I can't really stress it enough. My personal favourite and most famous is Tsuna Awakens. This soundtrack can give me enough energy after a 40 hour marathon to do it again. I can honestly say I would be able to be on par with Goku while listening to it. It's like an upgraded version of the Rocky theme. While Tsuna Awakens may be the best, don't let that fool you, the others are almost equally as good. 
 
Art - 
 
Since it has ran from 2006 to 2010, it doesn't have the art style of a Madhouse anime. It may not have overly epic visual effects like in Fate/Stay Night UBW 1st and 2nd season. And the backgrounds may not be as astonishing as those from K. But let me tell you, for a 2006 anime, it's still really good. I am a huge critic on art style, but this show was so good, it made me feel like art didn't even matter. 
 
Enjoyment - 
 
Funny scenes, epic scenes, fight scenes, awkward scenes, it's all in one big package of goody goodness. It gives the right kind of mood at the right moment. 
 
If by now you're still not convinced, I can write about 20 pages more about how much I love this show. 203 episodes may seem long to most, but I've seen (and read) it twice and would do so again in a heartbeat. Honestly it doesn't feel like 200+ episodes. 
 
Just watch it, you won't regret it.

    Yo, its me again writing a review for the show “Sonic Soldier Borgman”. I hope that my review can give an idea of what kind of show borgman is and if you want to give a try on this series. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a high tech future where technology is top notch, the youma empire is planning to conquer the earth but there are three people to stop them. Ryo the hot headed leader, Chuck the smart and handsome guy and Anise the cute and brave girl, those three are teachers on a public school but when youma start their invade they transform into to borgman to fight the monsters. 
 
The plot is a clear mix between a super sentai / metal hero / 80’s anime, the alien empire the transformation on a colored armors and the personalities of the protagonists is a clear references of sentai metal hero, don’t expect nothin’ complex on the plot and be ready for a slow pace development but there is a plot twist and some revelations here and there (note: there are some plot holes too but nothing too serious). 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 80's artstyle and from one of my favorites artists, Kia Asamiya under de alias of Michitaka Kikuchi. But inconsistency is the name of this show, going from some episodes of excellent quality (episodes 21, 25, 26, 33, 34 and 35) to some poor animation. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound is one of the great points, the opening is amazing and the endings is really good, plays a lot of jazz, j pop and chill hop during the episodes and i liked very much. 
 
Characters: 6 
Overall the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, in special chuck and dust jead seiyuus. Most of the characters have their own personality an individual development and is explain the motivation of them, on each episode one of the main characters is the focus. I can say that Chuck, Memory Jean and Dust Jead are my favorites and the phantom swat leader Miki is a great character, Ryo and Anise are fine but there are the some annoying kids on the show (specially Shinji), I can see why the kids were there and makes sense but sometimes its annoying. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Well, i enjoyed this anime mostly because i like 80's/90's obscure animes. And i can pointed that this is a decent show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice, don’t expect a complex plot and innovation on the characters. 
 
Overall: 7 
If you are interested in watch Borgman I can say that you’re looking for some simple yet fun anime. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much on the story. It may get a bit repetitive, but the anime style and the number of episodes can be very friendly to you, so if you have some freetime and want to watch a short but very fun show, go fot it. 
 
I hope you like the review and find it usefull.

    (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site) 
 
[Synopsis]:  In the city of Neo-Venezia on the planet Aqua, once known as Mars before being terraformed, Mizunashi Akari (Hazuki, Erino) works as an Undine under the Aria Company – a professional gondolier who ferries the citizens of Neo-Venezia as well as tourists through the city’s many waterways. Though only a fledgling Undine, Akari and her friends Aika (Saito, Chiwa) and Alice (Hirohashi, Ryou) have high aspirations of one day becoming as accomplished as their respective teachers, known as the Three Water Fairies of Neo-Venezia. Aria The Natural takes off right where Aria The Animation left off and in much the same way it explores the city of Neo-Venezia through the interactions of Akari and her friends. 
 
[Characters]: 
 
Something that I felt was lacking in the previous season of the show in respect to the main trio of girls was character depth – nothing so grand as intricate character development but rather I felt the characters needed a greater number of traits in order to better individualize each character and more importantly make them more compelling and enjoyable. In this, I am happy to report that Aria The Natural does a great job in fleshing out the characters we initially grew to know in the first season and while hardly any of them go through true long-standing character development, the additional attention to some characters and insight into their personalities was a major strength of the show brought on by this season. 
 
Our protagonist Akari is definitely the least changed of the three girls however she also had the most going for her to begin with and so the show does not suffer in this way. Her cheery attitude and constant wonderment are kept consistent throughout the season and her characterization still works wonderfully alongside the tone of the show. While there is still plenty of Akari to go around and plenty of Akari-centric episodes I feel that the show’s occasional departure from her being the absolute center of events was a pleasurable change of pace and perspective as this approach allowed for other characters to take center stage and become more elaborate. 
 
Aika undeniably benefited the most from this season’s branching out. While she closely emulated Akira’s prohibitive tendencies and felt unique within the three apprentice Undines she was a bit hard to pin down as she lacked a sufficient number of character traits with which to identify or empathize with. Aria The Natural does a great job exploring more of Aika and rectifies one of her problems from the first season which was lack of screen time; by the end of the season I felt far more familiar with her personality and the small handful of episodes dedicated to her did wonders for her characterization. After the events of this season Aika will certainty be one of the more enjoyable characters going forward. 
 
Alice also was granted more screen time and episodic attention this season though I would say that she ultimately benefited less than Aika from this season and could stand to be elaborated upon just a bit more. Despite this I think she still walks away a much better character from this season and continues to be one of the highlights of the show for me personally. What appeared as an initially dismissed character trait within the first season is returned to at greater length this time around – to the point that the episode that expounds upon this is one of the best in the entire season. 
 
Shoring up the characters with a few added traits and developments helped keep things more interesting this time around and while they didn’t develop immensely, they did change in subtle ways as they came into new ideas and realizations and this felt like enough for both them and the show. 
 
[Art/Animation]: 
 
The art remains unchanged from the first season and so viewers will love or hate each aesthetic element for much the same reason. The scenery and setting are once again beautiful in their art and execution and support the show alongside the soundtrack fantastically. The opening sequences of each episode do a good job of introducing the show each time and their dynamic appearance helps keep them interesting. 
 
[Story]: 
 
Aria The Natural goes about its business in a familiar way to that of the first season however had a slew of improvements over the previous formula while maintaining what made the original show enjoyable. The length of the season helped the show in that it allowed it to uphold its previously established slow and relaxing pace while more frequently featuring episodes of some ‘consequence’ where the tone shifted slightly or where the focus of the episode was on someone other than Akari and her encounters. 
 
One of the major strengths of this season was how a handful of episodes shifted to more of a melancholy tone which gave the show some much needed diversity beyond its raw, over-the-top optimism. There is certainly a place for this within the show and it is very much Aria’s primary goal to support this theme however the added range of emotion was a significant improvement and something that this season features over the prior. These kinds of episodes offered the most in the way of character insight and world exploration and were generally the highlights of the show with a few exceptions. 
 
While i wouldn’t say that the show was more ‘comical’ this time around, I felt that the exchanges and comedic remarks were more on point in Aria The Natural – they were generally funnier and more enjoyable perhaps having already established many of the catchphrases and typical reactions during the first season. Though I was not a huge fan of the more supernatural elements of the show furthered by this season I will concede that they were well incorporated into both the pacing and the tone of the show. 
 
[Music]: 
 
Much like the art and animation of the show the music remains pretty much unchanged from the first season and is a strong element of the show for the same reasons. Again the music blended well with the atmosphere and attitude of the show to present a soothing setting in which the events of the show transpired. 
 
[Final Thoughts and Rating]:  
 
Aria The Natural was, in my opinion, a step up from the first season in how it further explained and defined its main characters and because it introduced more interesting themes intermittently while upholding what the show did well in in the first place. While I didn’t feel enthralled by each and every episode, the show had strong high points which kept me watching above all else – the show’s ability to deliver the occasional highly emotional or compelling episode was far better this season and the first reason I would cite as to this season’s improvements and superiority over the prior. 
 
Rating: 7 
 
I gave Aria The Natural a 7 because the show took what was done in Aria The Animation and expanded upon it successfully, adding things such as characterization and additional themes which I had previously felt the show was wanting. Given the show’s 26 episodes I occasionally felt a little bored by the proceedings however the show seemed to know just when to throw in an especially good episode to pick me back up and so while the season dragged occasionally it was never for long and the high points of the show were chiefly responsible for the show achieving the rating it did. 
 
[Recommendations]: 
 
In my previous review I cautioned those interesting in the slice of life nature of the show that it was somewhat demanding in that very little takes place and there wasn’t a great deal of appeal beyond the typical slice of life dynamic and though those reading this review have likely seen the first season I will at least say that the same caution is not necessarily this time around as this season offers much more in the areas of characters and story than its predecessor. Additionally, though I think Aria still falls short of belonging to the genre of ‘comedy’ I do think that this season was funnier and so those who may have found this quality lacking in the first season should be pleased with how the gag remarks and reactions have improved. Due to the length of the season Aria The Natural was able to postulate a good many more things than the first season and though the show hardly approaches the territory of the psychological it does present some food for thought in the way of its episodic themes and may be enjoyable to prospective viewers for this reason.

    Okay, this anime was fine, like my score. I'm not going to bash it, but I'll say what I liked and didn't like. 
 
Likes: The only thing I swear I really liked was episode 14 and the opening Crossing Field by LiSA. The anime is starts off good, but then when it gets to like episode 10 where the main male and female protagonist get together, I got bored, but then when episode 13 hit it got better. The first half of the season was episode 1-14.  
 
Dislike: My opinion is that you do NOT watch the second half of the season, which is episodes 15-25. The main female protagonist was likeable at first, but then she got all whiny and damsel in distress on us, so it was like the male protagonist had to always come save her, which he did. Another thing I disliked was the fact that all the female characters had a crush on him. That's what I disliked about a lot of animes. A guy isn't that great that you have all the girls fall in love with him. And even when the male protagonist already had a girlfriend, he sometimes looked like he flirted with the other girls sometimes. Even his younger sister (technically cousin). 
 
Art: Decent, but I've seen prettier and better art. 
 
All in all, I give Sword Art Online a 6. It was decent, but it could have done better. It's not the best anime I've seen.

    (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site) 
 
[Synopsis]: Kenzou Tenma (Kiuchi Hidenobu) was a renowned, genius, neurologist and a rising star in the medical world until he disobeyed a direct order from Eisler Memorial Hospital’s chief director. Instead of operating on the newly arrived Mayor who had promised to fund the hospital in the near future, Tenma made decision based on his own morality to save Johan Liebert (Sasaki Nozomu), the adopted son of an East German diplomat who had arrived first. At the cost of his social standing, Tenma saves the young boy though, soon after, the director and several doctors at the hospital are found poisoned and Johan and his twin sister Anna (Noto Mamiko), missing. Years later, Johan’s reappearance in front of Tenma reveals him to be a callous murderer which sparks Tenma’s own journey to discover Johan’s true identity and right the wrong of saving him years ago. 
 
[Characters]: 
 
It should immediately speak to the strength of Monster’s many attributes that it is hard to say which one of them is truly the most beneficial or compelling given how powerful each of the show’s components are. The cast of the show is terrific and expansive and while the main group of characters is highly engaging, the supporting cast is captivating in its own right. The show hits upon a means of instantly humanizing certain characters, often through their relationships with others and this leads to majority of the cast feeling overwhelmingly familiar and understandable. 
 
Though at times Tenma fades in and out of the story in favor of exploring the current events from other perspectives and gaining insight elsewhere in the world, he is doubtlessly the protagonist and an important person to highlight. He is well characterized from the beginning – more than simply a meek doctor under the thumb of the hospital director, he is frustrated and conflicted, concerned and at a times full of regret. One can clearly see why he behaves the way he does and his sense of morality both influences his character heavily as well as the themes of the show. His development is as subtle as it is substantial and over the course of 74 episodes he is tasked with continuously reevaluating what he believes in and what he must do to continue moving forward. 
 
Given the nature of the story, the other character of greatest import to elaborate upon is Johan, though the main cast of characters features highly compelling and interesting characters across the board. The titular ‘Monster’ of the series, he is certainly characterized as such though it is not purely his mercilessness and cold intelligence that sets him up as such but rather also his charisma and frightening ability to bring out the worst in people and manipulate them to his will. Johan is treated much like a horror monster, rarely seen but effectively ever-present though sometimes far away with many layers between him and the events transpiring. Though he himself is only intermittently seen, he is utterly core to the narrative and learning about his past – what drives him and what made him the way he is, is the focus of much of the show. His relationship with Tenma is endlessly engaging and through each horrific action and tragedy he seems to ask of Tenma whether or not he still believes that all human lives are truly equal. 
 
Though characters such as Anna and Lunge are wonderfully complex and fascinating, the supporting cast deserves special attention here. Monster employs an immense number of people to tell its story, many of whom are surprisingly deep and memorable. A news reporter is more than simply an exasperated man with deadlines – he has a wife that left him and he wants to get back together but can’t figure out how. The gun instructor is more than a gruff, military man – he raises a daughter whose mother he killed in Myanmar during the war. Everybody is interconnected though it rarely if ever feels overly coincidental. Johan’s presence has warped these people together for better or worse and watching how they interact is like observing the ominous wake of a monster as it passes. Though the cast exhibits a myriad of personalities, a propensity for development, and a complicated parallelism that binds them together, it is the way their experiences and the events that transpire inform their identities that is the true masterwork of the show. 
 
[Art/Animation]: 
 
Following the character discussion, it is pertinent to highlight the many varying character designs featured. Not only are the designs distinct and set apart each member of the massive cast from one another but their variety in facial structure, body-type, and mannerisms complicate the cast on a visual level immensely. Characters aside, the show goes a long way in establishing the atmosphere of each scene and a great deal of Monster’s intensity and anxiety can be attributed to it’s darker and more brooding tones. The countless environments and townscapes are beautiful and distinct as the story travels to each location. 
 
[Story]: 
 
Just as Monster’s characters are endlessly compelling and interesting to watch, so too is its narrative which exhibits numerous strengths and relatively no weaknesses. The first episode is quite gripping – it begins with the introduction of Dr. Tenma and his position within the hospital and one gets an immediate sense of it’s hierarchical nature and the politics at play as well as the source of his frustration and conflicted feelings. The subject matter of the first episode ties very well into the theme it introduces – the equality or inequality of human lives and it ends on a cliffhanger involving the murder of Johan’s adoptive parents. The second episode doubles down on the thematic ideas expressed in the first and its events really draw the viewer into a haunting and unfair world. The first several episodes serve as a great hook into the series yet can hardly anticipate the epic and sprawling story to follow. 
 
Of all of Monster’s qualities it is perhaps its pacing that will be what challenges most viewers. The story moves at a very methodical and deliberate pace and while the subject matter of each episode is usually quite thrilling it has a tendency to hint and prod at many realizations and future scenes rather than rushing into them quickly and this slower pace may detract from the show for some viewers. There are no real filler episodes and effectively everything that happens has a place within the overarching narrative. After the show gets rolling, it does pan away from Tenma for periods at a time to investigate and develop other characters and plots which are equally if not more interesting. The latter half of the show is, if possible, even more exciting and the revelations roll in one after another in a way that makes Monster very hard to put down. 
 
The story is positively fascinating but it would not share in the success it does without its pervasive and intelligent use of themes to tie everything together. The list of themes is extensive and includes such ideas as the equality of human life, the implication of names and identities, amnesia and memories, good and evil, and whether or not the titular ‘Monsters’ exist. These themes form an ongoing dialogue with the events of the show and its characters and enliven each development hugely. The interconnected nature of the cast and the parallelism shared between them is further complicated by these overarching ideas which make Monster both assertive and engrossing. 
 
The last thing to touch upon is the show’s use of allegory which, in juxtaposition to its themes as well as the backstories of its characters, provides uniquely thrilling and mysterious insight into its cast. Through the presence of picture books and certain repeated phrases and stories, Monster continuously creates intelligent, narrative implications and foreshadows future events which are a major factor in the overall strength of the show. Monster exhibited some of the most pertinent and well organized allegory I have seen. 
 
[Music]: 
 
Though Monster’s visuals were electrifying and gripping, the presentation wouldn’t have been nearly as strong had they not been set against such a strong soundtrack. The music was wonderfully dramatic and very tonally focused, sometimes slow and brooding but at other times swelling to a climax alongside the visuals and subject matter. As a whole the sound design was excellent and on top of the soundtrack, the use of certain techniques like a progressively faster beating heartbeat and the downpour of rain slowly becoming deafening as the scene builds added an unexpected grandeur to the scenes. The creak of a door, the sound of scuffling footsteps, and the like were very atmospheric elements and when combined with the music were integral to the success of Monster’s presentation. 
 
[Final Thoughts and Rating]:  
 
Monster represents a show that was engaging and gripping on all levels and the intelligence of its design shone through in each scene and development. Though the initially slower episodes that followed the story’s lengthy introduction unfolded rather leisurely, the majority of the show and particularly its latter half were incredibly captivating and increasingly hard to put down. 
 
Rating: 10 
 
I gave Monster a 10 because it was intelligent, insightful, provocative, complicated, and a myriad other things that augmented its tenacious story and brilliant characters. The way in which people were shaped by their experiences, the thematic implications layered across scenes and events, the atmospheric presentation, the compelling supporting cast of characters, and the inventive use of allegory all coalesced to make for an incredibly captivating show. 
 
[Recommendations]: 
 
Monster occupies a variety of different genres and features some of the best content of each. Those looking for a fantastic, psychological drama will be thrilled with the manner in which the show operates. The mystery and horror elements are executed to perfection as well and will likely keep fans of those genres captivated practically all throughout. The only concern I would voice is that the length of the show and its pacing require some patience from the viewer and on a case by case basis the show may be too long-winded for some people.

    Berserk: The Golden Age Arc III - The Advent Review 
 
*As all my previous reviews for Berserk so far I've stated that this and to this point of writing this my review I have yet to read pass chapter 2 of the manga. So all thoughts in this are only going to be compared to the 90s anime as I don't know which one was more accurate when it came to the differences or removal or additional scenes added or removed from both movies and 90s version so please bare that in mind. 
 
 
Story (9/10) Great 
 
The 3rd in the trilogy movie of The Golden Age Arc in Berserk was great. Like in the previous parts certain scenes where remove (as far as the 90s version is concerned) and I'm only going to name the two that stood out to me as far as their removal one being understandable why it was remove and is forgiven by me and the other is debatable and I will get to that. This part of the movie adapts episodes 20 (well a little bit of 20)-25 of the 90s anime and the third part of the Golden Age Arc in the manga. And going by the anime the first scene should have started off is where Guts leaves and makes the blacksmith who helps him repair his weapon (you know the one that got destroyed in the 90s anime) and him doing training with it. Obviously this didn't happen in the movie and like I said before I don't know if it was apart of the manga or not at this point of me writing this review. Anyway this scene is understandable why it was remove because if they removed that previous scene that kind of have to remove this one too because they are directly connected and it's debatable if this particular blacksmith/training scene was extremely important to the overall story or not, not saying it isn't but like I said if they had to remove any scene (because they will) I would have rather it be this scene so it's why I find it understandable to an extent. The second scene which I felt really shouldn't have been removed (and because it probably scared me the more and is still burnt into my brain to this day that a movie only watcher would never know of) is the scene where Casca is being held up by that one demon that was basically about to shove is demon head horn straight up in right in front of Guts right before Griffith was demonically reborn. Like I said I'm not sure if the 90s anime created that scene or if the manga did but which ever one did that scene was the one that scared me the most and it was removed from this movie adaptation oh well.  
 
Now instead of talking about scenes that where changed or removed. This section I want to talk about the scenes that were added. These new scenes I'm assuming where scenes that the 90s anime probably either removed from the manga or scenes that this movie made up (which I highly doubt the movie made up these scenes so I'm going with my first assumption). First scene is the scene after Guts and Casca have their sex out in the woods by the waterfall and the Skullking (as they call him) appears before Guts warning him just as Nosferatu did about the tragic future that will soon unfold before him. As a person who has only read 2 chapters of the manga so far, the 90s anime and the 2 movies up to this point this would be the first time of me seeing this character The Skullking, I think it was mentioned in the 90s anime but I can't remember. Anyway the second scene is during the demonic sacrificial ceremony for Griffith outside of the tornado we are shown that The Skullking and Nosferatu are fighting outside having some sort of foreshadowing conversation which I doubt I'm suppose to entirely understand at this point but it's good placement and I appreciate any new scenes this being another one of them. The next scene is where the 90s anime cliffhangers us. In this adaptation it goes a little bit further. Showing us new scenes starting with how Guts got and Casca (surprisingly) got out of that demonic realm with the Skull King coming to their rescue. It also shows the aftermath of Guts, his eye and arm missing and Casca's lost of memory. Lastly this shows Guts running away and meeting up with the some demons that now stalk him because of the sacrificial brand he got during the ceremony and the Skullking explaining some things to him this is where the movie concludes telling us ""This is only the beginning"" now that's a way better was to get someone to read the manga vs the 90s anime, which is why I give this story section a 9. 
 
 
Art and Animation (7/10) Good 
More Specifically (7.5/10) Good+ 
 
The art and animation for this 3rd part of the movie was better than the 2nd part by a little but still not as good as the 1st movie. Just like the previous movie CGI will indeed hold this back from being an amazing adaptation from and art style and animation standpoint. This movie are far as the ratio for hand drawn to CG looks about 60:40. Most of the scenes in this 3rd part that were CGI were the demons inside the ceremony scene. Now I don't know about you but I felt they didn't feel are creepy in this version because they were CG this time around. Also during the ceremony and slaughter sacrifice of the Hawks scene the brightness and dark cell shading during the scene made it a bit hard to see every traumatizing thing that's taking place not enough to not understand completely but enough for me to point it out. These are the reasons I feel it couldn't reach an 8 like the first movie but is still a little bit better than the 2nd because at least the scenes like when Guts was cutting away at his arm to get to Casca adapted far batter than the 90s version other few scenes where like this not many.  
 
 
Sound (10/10) Outstanding  
 
I was watching this movie with some surround sound headsets one and I'll tell you what it definitely allowed me to hear the amount of audio depth they've put into this part (btw I wore headsets for the previous 2 also but it didn't stand out as much as it did in this one). The english dub is still great nothing wrong there, no memorable BGM but what did stand out and made me have to give this section a 10 was the sound effects they used on the demons during the ceremony many different growls, screeches, hissing and clicking (especially clicking) noises that the demons where making that made you feel like you were there with them and it different sold it for me. 
 
 
Characters (10/10) Masterpiece 
 
No problems or concerns came up when it came to the characters and how they were portrayed in this 3rd part. I'm sure if I read the manga I probably would have something to say but I felt nothing was out of place when it came to everything that was presented and the extra scenes that this movie brought only made it better. 
 
 
Enjoyment (9/10) Great  
 
My enjoyment for this movie was great. I was engrossed just as much in this one was I was when I first watched the 90s version (unlike the 2nd movie). Every time I saw a new scene that wasn't in the 90s version it only made it more enjoyable and the ending to the movie I felt was a better conclusion to this arc vs the 90s anime. 
 
 
Overall (9/10) Great 
More Specifically (9.10/10) Great 
 
This movie 3rd part of the movie I felt overall was actually better than the 90s anime as far as what was shown and the scenes that were added. Like I said previous I really appreciate them not scaring and cliffhangering me like the 90s version did. Nothing else really needs to be said, I'll definitely be starting the manga later this year and I can't fucking wait to dive in.

    This is simply a bad adaptation. Shirou is generic instead of being a subtly unhinged/mentally ill guy. Rin acts like a generic tsundere instead of a mature person who can actually hold a conversation. Lots of time is wasted showing characters like Caster when they should have spent the run time conveying Shirou's psychological characterization from the VN. Archer's lines make no sense because Shirou's inner thoughts are never conveyed. The translation quality is terrible. Three episodes are spent having Shirou, Archer, and Saber repeat the same lines at each other. The action scenes are flashy and meaningless, they do not convey any of the fascinating thoughts Shirou had during them. 
 
I recommend the Japanese VN (not the terrible fan translation) for those interested in proper characterization and dialogue over flashy visuals.

    I usually never write reviews, but I feel like this entry has been especially wrongfully reviewed. This title, as most other sequels on MAL otherwise, suffers greatly from what I'd like to call, the ""sequel syndrome"". Basically all the diehard fans are the only ones left that are watching it, so naturally their scores will be biased, which works against the users that are interested in giving it a try, because it hides the issues that have begun plaguing the series. Anyway, I'll start by saying that as of right now we've been through 2 cours of Diamond no Ace, and the production is nothing like the previous seasons. The series already started going downhill after the upperclassmen retired, however season 2 was still somewhat enjoyable, since Madhouse was still receiving help from Production IG. But this time around things are different, Madhouse is handling the project alone and every aspect of it seems to signal the fact that it is a massive burden for them. 30 episodes in, and despite the show being an absolute slideshow, we've gotten 2 recap episodes and no new opening or ending sequence. Pretty disappointing, right ? Unfortunately, the production isn't the only problem the show has. This is a baseball anime, but so far, this season offered the least baseball out of them all. After failing miserably at Koshien few episodes in (which renders the progress they've made in the previous season completely useless), there isn't much baseball going on anymore. We're mainly getting training and character drama which after 150 episodes it just feels... boring ? So we get a poorly produced show about baseball, which features no baseball. One would wonder, what went wrong ? How could a decent show turn into such a mind numbingly boring experience ? I think the main culprit is the author, for dragging out this series for as long as he could. I can always appreciate an author having a clear vision on how their manga would end, but this is clearly not the case for Diamond no Ace, and that is directly reflected by the awful quality of this season.

    Part 1 Chunk: (Please forgive me for basically writing an essay.  I need to find another hobby.) 
 
What show could fit your mood if you're looking for something simple yet fun? This show.  It is nothing more than a children's show, but it is far from being boring.  Sure, it can get rather repetitive, but the repetitive parts I found hard to outright hate, actually.  I do dislike a certain character who is purely there to create filler, but even she ends up better in the end.  If anything, this show stole my heart AND if you think stealing hearts is a bad thing, this show will do it anyway with magic potions, love charms, hugs, smiles, and kisses.   
 
Two Witches named Chocolat Meilleure and Vanilla Mieux are Queen Candidates who collect valuable different colored hearts can only receive them by wooing Human boys.  (""Gotta catch 'em all! That is their master plan."")   
 
Yes, Humans and Witches are two different species pretending to date, but Witches are not allowed to fall in love with Humans no matter what (i.e., their hearts are not allowed to turn Red).  Does it get really hard not to wish they could reciprocate a Humans' feelings fully at times? Sure, but if anything that just makes Witches desire to understand and observe the ways in which love works like scientists more.  However, they aim to gather experience in the Human world so that they can learn the best from both worlds and apply that to their futures in Magical World politics or in whatever else they choose to do.  It's supposed to be a Win=Win situation, despite Witches not being able to fall in love with Humans, in general.  
 
The show, however, throws its biggest hurdle at the Queen Candidates with the introduction of a group called the Ogres.  Since Chocolat and Vanilla are fairly young and naive, they learn the hard way about how they already have enemies out to get them because of their royal status.  If the Witches are dedicated to pure love, the Ogres are dedicated to all that is evil and/or taboo, such as forbidden love, etc.; in other words, they are natural born enemies.   
 
One particular character, who attends school with the Queen Candidates, is very interesting because he is supposed to be an Ogre, yet he is very innocent in appearance (I will not say who, but it should become fairly obvious early on).  He believes that if Witches and Ogres aren't supposed to love Humans, they are meant to be taken over.  So, if the girls represent the essence of pink, BOY, does he embrace the essence of the color black.  His presence is said to be full of ""Noir."" 
 
So, while this show is very simple, the way everything is set up the characters are going to have to grow A LOT (especially Vanilla who is a shy, frail, polite, bundle of nerves; as opposed to Chocolat who is brave, stubborn, and outgoing but has poor manners).   
 
In fact, the ending is a fantastic example of how having the will power to do what is right can transcend most if not all of the conflict, confusion, and uncertainty thrown their way.  As predictable as the outcome may be, it is never boring to watch it when it feels like a theater play whose leads try to perform with their heads held high and their hearts gleaming (very pretty, shiny hearts). 
 
Part 2 Chunk: 
 
Sugar Sugar Rune has a very European flavor with lots of eccentricity added to it and some goth touches, so no setting could possibly fit it better like a glove! The Magical World, however, looks like Halloween Town and Candy Land put together!  
 
It's important to mention the food, too, after mentioning Candy Land, right? Well, it's completely Western/European, very appetizing, and, also, consists of tons of desserts and candy!  
 
A fun quirk is that many things are given a French name.  Although, the French is really simple and is nothing like the lengthier phrases used in, say Maria-sama ga Miteru, for example.  Some of the spells Chocolat uses, for instance, are ""La Fleur Spirale,"" ""La Étoile Brilliant,"" ""Agrandizement,"" etc.   
 
This show, also, loves bubble baths, fragrances, pearls, jewels, charms, stars, the Moon, or any kind of mysticism that Witches might love.  Creativity is certainly not something this show lacks, nor foreign, exotic, or paradise scenery! 
 
Aside from everything else, I could draw a good amount of similarities between Sugar Sugar Rune and Harry Potter, such as a flying car, flying broomsticks, Mandrake, dragons, big spiders, unicorns, an invisibility cloaking object, etc.   
 
The art in the show is quite good.  Although, I think it could've been done better, especially if you compare some of it to Moyoco Anno's gorgeous art in the manga.  The animation varies from average to very neat and exciting, such as the Witches falling from the sky in the 1st episode, and the ending of the 4th episode is wow! Pretty is all I can say.  The animation in the 37th episode, and plenty of other episodes is surprisingly top notch, also.   
 
The music in the show is quite memorable, in fact, some of the songs are playing in my head right now.  The best song is, of course, the opening! It is a song that pays homage to ""Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son"" by France Gall and is probably one of the most fun songs I've heard as an anime OP as of yet (except for Azumanga Daioh's OP, maybe?).  I think I've watched the opening 100 times already, but the two ending songs are really pleasant, too! 
 
Who has the best seiyuu? Honestly, I cannot choose, since all of them did a fantastic job and sound very cute saying little phrases in French. 
   
Robin - His seiyuu has an incredibly silky smooth voice, and he sings great! (Listen to Robin's seiyuu sing ""SUPERSTAR"" and ""DON'T CRY."")   
Chocolat - Her seiyuu gets some of the best lines.  Even though everybody in this show seems to have a catchphrase, hers are the best.   
Vanilla - Her seiyuu is fitting and sounds like she's going to cry all the time; although, it could get on some peoples' nerves a little bit.   
Duke and Blanca - They're opposites, and they fight and argue a lot so that's done very well.   
Saule and Houx - They sound like teenagers for sure, but they are very unusual for twins in quite a few ways.   
Pierre - His seiyuu has a handsome voice; however, he sure likes to inflect some harshness and increase volume later on.   
Rest of cast - no complaints there, except for Waffle, who is just annoying.   
 
If you'd like an easy to get into show with an interesting characters and magical world set up, Sugar Sugar Rune is definitely worth checking out.  I don't think it'll ever become more popular than Shugo Chara! But it definitely gives it a run for its money.  It's one of the cooler magical girl shows that's for sure!

    On the surface 'Maki-chan to Nau' appears to be a realisation of every straight man's fantasy about the girl next door that would hop on their dick every single day like a crazed lioness in heat for no reason whatsoever. In reality though it's a two way street, as it also caters to a nympho's fantasy about being discovered and violated by said man in ways that would make a pornography major want to rethink his life. 
 
The story is fairly standard for a hentai flick. We have our protagonist Seiichi Sakonji, a young man with a lifelong dry spell who, for some reason, wears the same fucking shirt every single day. One evening while on his apartment's balcony Seiichi is drawn to the sounds of a woman servicing herself and cant help but to investigate the issue further. Enter the heroine, Maki Sanjou. The two immediately bond in an anticlimactic and eerie manner, as if you were watching two soda dispensers come to life and try to hug each other.  
 
The sex scenes in 'Maki-chan to Nau' are mostly risqué in nature. Expect lots of balcony performances, train shenanigans, voyeurism,  BDSM etc. There's definitively something for every hentai connoisseur here. The second half of the series also conveniently adds another female character in case anyone was starting to get bored after the first 2 episodes.  
 
While the animation and sex scenes themselves were good, one problem I have with this Hentai is that everything happens too easily. There's no conflict, no effort required on the part of the male lead, no build up to any sexual encounter at all and no attention to detail. I like my porn refined and with a bit of a back story, fuck even the old pizza delivery guy routine will do. 'Maki-chan to Nau' just doesn't have that, there's no emotion here, instead it just goes straight for the climax.  
 
The sound department is a mixed bag. Voice acting itself is decent but the sound effects leave much room for improvement. For the record, sex doesn't sound like a Tesco employee handling jugs of milk. You also get your standard porny music that you might as well have heard in some elevator or a McDonald's commercial.  
 
The animation on the other hand is top notch. Really crisp and detailed. This is where, naturally, the studio focused the most.  
 
All in all, the story is lacking, animation is brilliant and sound, while not a disaster, could be vastly improved upon. Then again, this is porn and if you're here exclusively for the sex (No shit?) then you'll still enjoy it. 
 
7 points.

    Needless 
 
 
This anime is about the aftermath of a World War 3. A bomb was dropped on Tokyo city and as a result, some people gained strange powers like controlling fire or water or having great speed or strength and stuff like that (much similar to that in Sekirei). These people were given the name Needless (which is also the anime's title if you hadn't noticed). This anime is a perfect combination of action and comedy together with time to time ecchi. 
 
The story in this anime is quite good. It's basically about a group of Needless fighting another group which is oppressing them. The story has progressed quite well. From start to end everything is in perfect order. They gave a pretty decent introduction as to what is happening and also gave a satisfying ending to the story which sort of ends the possibility that the anime will get a second season and continue with the manga. Anyway, it really won't matter that much when you finish the anime. 
 
Voice acting done was pretty decent. It wasn't like they were doing it on gunpoint or anything. It was pretty good. The artwork was also well done. It was well done and matched the sheer violence this anime had to offer. The way the action scenes were shown was also quite good. 
 
All the characters in Needless had perfect roles in the anime's story. All introduced characters had perfect and important roles in the story. Along with a role in the story, all characters had something funny happen to them which was very well done and these scenes decreased the overall seriousness which most animes of the action genre have. This anime is one of the best animes I have seen yet. I enjoyed every part of it. It's just full of comedy. Whenever a scene got too serious or emotional, something funny was thrown in to lighten up things. Even the finale, which is supposed to be a very serious and/or emotional episode, also had comical scenes around every corner. A scene did not go too long without some comical scene in it. 
 
Needless is a great anime. The violence might be too bloody but the excess comedy more than makes up for that. The way bloody violence and comedy have been mixed in this anime has made it quite different from the rest where most action animes are often serious. This great combination of action and comedy is what makes this anime awesome. 
 
I am open to suggestions. Feel free :-)

    I am only writing a review of this as a warning. This hentai is very hardcore! If you are into multiple fetishes involving rape a bondage or gore than this is a good show for you to watch. If you dont like these sort of things then dont watch.. 
 
That aside I enjoyed it very much. I found it satisfying because It was so extreme compared to most hentai anime. The animation and characters were also pretty nice. Although I must admit some of the designs were a bit generic. Definately a must see for the hardcore fans. Other wise Avoid it like cancer.

    Grab your popcorn, get comfy, and prepare for an EPIC SHOW. 
 
Honestly, I was very skeptical from the beginning, mainly due to the a very unapologetic vintage looking art style that looks like cowboy bebop and trigun. I have to say this now: DON'T GET TURNED OFF BY THE ART AND ANIMATION. I have to admit, the art didn't really get any better...it is a brand new studio so it was evident that they didn't have a lot o f budget to work with. The animation was NOT consistent at all. However, I have to give credit to the studio for making the important scenes look good. There was a couple of shots where I was genuinely impressed (the steam rising off of JOE got me SO HYPED), but I have to admit that the art and animation was not the best. The boxing matches could have been animated so much better, but in the end I didn't watch Megalo box because of the boxing matches, so... 
 
Off that note, the story of this series is not the strongest either. Its not particularly original nor is it extremely complex (it is really straight forward and painfully simple) but the writing for the show as a whole WAS AMAZING. There was a lot of goosebump scenes in this series. There was also just the right amount of symbolism. The dialogues were well done, and although Megalo Boxwas short, I feel like I got a very wholesome story with well developed. I though the pacing was perfect. I was never bored, nor thought the writers were rushing the story at anypoint. Most importantly, this 13 episode show had a GOOD, FULFILLING ENDING. Thank GOD.  
 
What really makes this show for me is the characters and their relationships. Boy, I love Joe. I freakin' love him. Again he is a pretty simple character, but to me Joe is super likable. He's honest, straightforward, and definitely caring. He is loyal to his own desires.  
I also love Yuri.He is not your typical ""HAHA i'm the strongest, fight me when you're good enough"" kind of guy (even though he seems like that at first, but keep watching and you'll dismiss that judgement)  
What Joe and Yuri had at the end was SO BEAUTIFUL. This type of chivalry and camaraderie brought tears to my eyes. really. I knew that because I didn't give two shits about who won the final. I was just crying tears of joy during the entire scene because the two got to fight each other, fair and square. T_T 
I was also glad that there was more to Nanbu than just a fraud. That man got so much character development. Also the best mentor award definitely goes to Nanbu. 
Sachio! That kid has Naruto-level speech skills. Without his mouth, it would have been OVER for Joe and Nanbu a long time ago.  
 
Speaking of Sachio, can we just STOP and APPRECIATE HIS RAPS???!!!! Like honestly all the tracks in this dang show is so good! It's got a similar feel to the tracks from Devilman Crybaby. Like I love my Yuki Kaijura and Hiroyuki Sawano, but this was equally awesome.  
 
Overall, the only reason why this didn't  get a 10 is because of the things it COULD have done to be even better. In addition to art and animation, I felt like some of the other characters could have been a little more flushed out, for example Shirato, and maybe more background and Yuki pre-Shirato. But that's just me being nitpicky. Enjoyment wise, it was like a 10000000++++. As someone who also boxes, this was amazing. I said I didn't come for the matches, but that wasn't in the sense that I didn't LIKE the boxing. Sure it wasn't very flashy, but it felt pretty real: the *shhh* sound boxers make from punching, the very 'real' moves and combos, and the whole 'spirit' of the sport was captured perfectly. That was why I wasn't upset because the fight scenes weren't animated well enough, because in the end if it was 'super flashy' then perhaps I wouldn't have loved Megalo Box the way I love it now.  
 
All in all, I am so surprised a show like this was created in the year of 2018. Its a rare f****** gem, so go see it!!!!

    Great anime, would definitely recommend it. Good story, great art, great music and very enjoyable to watch. Each episode added to the development of the character and by the end of the story you can't help but fall in love with Violet Evergarden, both as a character, anime, and series as a whole. 
 
Extra: Nowadays when all the anime is filled with stupid kid screaming from the top of their lungs while swinging a massive sword, filled with disgusting amount of inappropriate content like loli and such, on-coming cliche that you know the series will use at one point after watching the first minute of the anime, over used isekai theme that is making all the original isekai series hung their head and beta main character that people can't relate to Violet Evergarden definitely comes out a step above and appears to be a masterpiece.

Madoka Magica is a show that I can't stop going back to. I've only gained more and more respect for the series each time I rewatch it and although I can admit that it isn't perfect, to me it's still deserving of a 10/10 rating. It would just feel like an absolute disservice to the show to rate it any lower. In all aspects, Madoka delivers. I decided to write my first review on this series not only because it's very special to me, but also because of how masterfully this show was written and directed. Let's get into it. MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD! WATCH THE SHOW! 
 
 
 
 
Story: 10 
The plot of Madoka does a really great job at staying interesting and new, without getting over complicated and convoluted. The world and Madoka's life are properly established and we can feel a sense of attachment very early on. However before the normal world is established, we are shown the flashback/dream sequence with Homura and the witch, cluing us into the fact that something is off. 
When Madoka and Sayaka are offered the contract to become magical girls, the series really takes it's time to let these characters think the decision over. Nothing feels rushed, and it doesn't feel like it drags on either, the show is just respecting how big of a decision these girls are about to make. Is there something that you desire so much that you would sacrifice your life to battle witches forever? 
However, up until this point (plot wise) the show hasn't really done anything to really heavily impact the tone of the show. It's been subtly building it up. While watching the show at this point I could never really completely buy into the typical ""Magical Girl"" genre. The presence of Homura, the gravity of the character's emotions and the dream sequence in the beginning threw me off. But despite the slight uneasiness, the show did seem to be going in the same direction ""Magical Girl"" shows tend to go in. Perhaps this was the equivalent to the ""Super Robot"" and ""Real Robot"" comparison, where one take on the genre is focused on the more fantastical elements and the other more focused on the characters... Then Mami Tomoe dies... 
Yeah it still hits hard. The biggest slap in the face I've ever experienced in anime. Despite all the red flags and warnings I still managed to buy into the act the show put up. It does it so brilliantly. And even if some fans weren't entirely sold by the act, no one was ready for that shit. So from this point on the series starts to go into hyper depresso mode as Madoka and Sayaka are traumatized by the death they witnessed. Survivor's guilt plagues the both of them, hating themselves for being weak. Sayaka decides that she will be strong and become a magical girl for other people's sake, while Madoka is still held back from doing the same thing by Homura. The tension between the characters including the newly introduced Kyoko start to raise pretty high as the series builds up to the next big plot twist.  
When girls sign the contract with Kyubey to become Puella Magi, they create a soul gem that is supposedly their source of power. Turns out, this power source is actually your literal soul and your body is an empty corpse that cannot live without the gem. Kyubey has demonstrated throughout the series that he cannot understand human emotions, so this to him was the most effective way for magical girls to battle witches efficiently, but to everyone else, it's pretty damn messed up. Upon learning this Sayaka starts hating herself for what she has become and her downwards spiral leads the show into the ""final plot twist"". Sayaka taints her soul gem to the point of no return and reveals the inevitable end for all magical girls, that they all fight against is that they eventually turn into witches. 
Despite the series continuing to hit the audience with darker and darker plot reveals, it doesn't come off as forced or edgy simply because it's presented in such a naturalistic way. Everything that happens to the characters and all the exposition about how the magical girls truly work, all feel like the natural progression of things. Despite how unexpected a plot twist is in this show, when you think about it, it's exactly what makes sense. Because of the standardized version of the genre, we continuously fail to see these events coming until they happen, we keep rooting for hope to overcome despair. 
In episode 10 we are given one last reveal, which ties all of the unanswered questions together. Homura has been time traveling to save Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey over and over. How fucking brilliant. Homura desperation comes center stage as we see her fail time and time again to prevent Madoka from becoming a magical girl to fight the boss witch, Walpurgisnacht. Even more brilliant, Kyubey explains that a magical girl's potential is measured by karmic power. So by reversing time over and over to save Madoka, Homura has inherently caused Madoka to contain the power of all different timelines, making her capable of becoming a god-level magical girl (and witch). 
Finally, what an incredible setup for the ending. The series thus far has constantly dealt with each character's individual struggle between hope and despair. Homura the whole time had been reliving her despair countless times, only being driven forward by her hope to save Madoka. This is, in my opinion, one of the best character arcs in all of anime. Finally Homura faces against Walpurgisnacht alone, being left with no alternative when Kyoko is basically killed by Kyubey (or at least left to die). But in the end, Madoka appears and makes the contract to become a Magical Girl. Her wish however, is to destroy all witches and ascend to God level status. She chooses to forever shoulder all of the despair of all the magical girls around the world, in order to free them from this unforgiving cycle they've been trapped in. Because of this decision the laws of the world are re written and human turmoil is now taken in the form of Wraiths in the new world. The magical girls continue to fight in a world where no one remembers Madoka. Except, by some beautiful miracle, Homura does. This ending is bittersweet, and although the plot gets a little more heavy in the final act, it all is thematically relevant. The battle of hope and despair is re written by Madoka, and now Homura shoulders her memories of her, but uses them to keep fighting. 
The plot of Madoka Magica is one that is constantly pulling you deeper into this ""darkness"" hidden under the surface. It pulls you bit by bit and gives you breaks to think ""okay, this is probably the worst it gets"", and then it yanks you another couple meters. Finally, the ending which is happy in one sense, but really not a happy ending at all. The Magical Girls are now saved by the new ""Law of the Cycle"" but are still bound to fight against the unchanging cruel world, and worst of all, in the case of Homura, she never really does fulfill her promise. All of this happens because Madoka sacrifices herself. That being said, Madoka does this by her own free will, happily shouldering the huge burden of being alone forever, a pain that Homura understood for a long time. Even the ending is a clash of hope and despair, and I absolutely love it. This series didn't need a happy ending, it had the balls to do something much deeper. I still think about this ending, and how much I respect it. 10 out of fucking 10. 
 
Art: 10 
Oh boy. I remember seeing promotional art for this series back when it was first coming out and thinking ""That art style is really pretty."" I loved the pastel colors and the sketchiness of the line-art. That factored in with the character designs made the show look cute, innocent and almost childlike. Even Kyubey's design through me for a loop, tricking me into thinking he looked like a cute Magical Girl Mascot. In typical Madoka fashion, I was manipulated into believing whatever Studio Shaft wanted me to believe until I actually started watching the show. 
The flashback in the first episode immediately shows off the de-saturation in the colors, completely contrasting to the vibrant colors used in backgrounds for shows like Sailor Moon and other alike. Not your typical Magical Girl aesthetic, but it wasn't until I saw the labyrinths that I realized just how different this show was gonna be. 
Talk about trippy. The striking reds and yellows, realistic stop motion and the paper cutout creatures (I don't even know how to describe them) starkly contrast everything I thought I knew about this shows design. The witches and familiars have the most crazy designs, but I just can't begin to express how impressed I was when I saw how amazingly everything blended together. I mean obviously the character's looked intentionally out of place for obvious reasons, but even then, battle sequences with Mami and Homura looked incredible when they took place in these environments, and speaking of battle sequences let's discuss the animation. 
There wasn't a moment in this show that I felt looked cheaply animated or lackluster in the slightest. The characters are always on model, poses are interesting, character designs and powers are fucking eye candy, and when the show wants to pull some sakuga, it does so VERY successfully. In episode 7 there is a fight scene with Sayaka that's done using silhouettes, and that imagery has never left my mind. I decided at that moment that this had to be one of my favorite shows.  
The art direction isn't just ambitious either. The show is filled with symbolic imagery, one of my favorite examples of this is Sayaka's labyrinth taking on the form of an orchestra. Moments like these are why I continued to come back to this show. There's so much artistic symbolism that you miss out on the first time. And going back and watching it, knowing everything is extremely rewarding thanks to subtle foreshadowing in the imagery. The OP is a great example of this. 
 
Sound: 10 
So I am by no means an expert on sound design. In fact, I've got a lot to learn on the subject, but it doesn't take a genius to see that Madoka has delivered in this category as well.  
Sounds effects are never weird or off putting, I never heard any of those weird *Squelching* noises that you hear in ""edgy gory shows"". I love the addition of the ticking clock noise you sometimes hear in the labyrinths and to be honest, I don't have much else to say about sound effects. 
The soundtrack however, is something worth talking about. This shows soundtrack puts me on the edge of my seat, makes my heart wrench, hypes me up and does other things to me that I don't fuckin understand. The opening, ""Connect"" by ClariS, is an upbeat opening that is actually hinting in some instances at the darker tones of the show through what I feel is the desperate voice the singer manages to convey. It's also catchy as hell. 
Finally, I'm gonna throw voice acting into this category as well, because this cast was so incredible. The mature, role model performance for Mami given by Kaori Mizuhashi, the innocence and kindness in Madoka by Aoi Yuuki and all the other VAs were really perfect. But I have to take a moment to specially gush about Saito Chiwa as Homura. The range from her innocence to her unwavering determination is just incredible. These VAs were passionate as hell and it shows. There's a scene in episode 10 where Homura is falling and helplessly watching Madoka make the contract with Kyubey again and she just lets out a desperate scream that shattered my heart into a million pieces.  
 
Character: 10 
I think that above everything else, the characters in Madoka Magica are what make it so much more interesting. The characters in this show are not conventional in the sense that they are ""people"". They are written more like representations of ideas, or case studies, and I think this kind of writing makes it much more interesting to delve into each character individually. 
Madoka is uncompromisingly kind. To the point where she spends most of the series crying about how horrible everything around her is.  I would find this extremely problematic in a character, if it weren't for the fact that she makes the ultimate sacrifice in the end, but also for the fact that, once again, these characters are supposed to represent ideas. Madoka represents innocence in its purest form. The show isn't concerned with whether or not that makes the character ""likable"" for the viewers, it just wants to work with the premise that this character has been brought up to be ""good"" and always wants to do what's right. What's interesting about Madoka, is seeing how she is affected by the situations the show puts her in, almost like experimenting. Madoka has to overcome herself and face reality. She decides to take fate into her own hands and, befitting to her character, shoulders everything as a God. Her character becomes even more interesting when you fair her with someone like Homura, who at times cannot understand how or why Madoka is always so nice, and has been hurt by it many times. The best thing about Madoka's pure and kind personality is that the show doesn't portray it as a completely good thing. 
Sayaka started off as a ""selfless"" girl. She believed that she was doing things for other people's sake. She became a magical girl so that Kyousuke could heal and continue playing the violin. However her desire to help others always came from a hidden place of self hate. In the case of Kyousuke, Sayaka had survivor's guilt. She felt guilty that her ""useless"" hands were fine in place of Kyousuke's talented hands being paralyzed. Although she wasn't aware of it at first, Sayaka wanted to help others in order to feel like she had worth. She wanted to fight for justice, to be praised and admired. Her acts were good, but her intentions weren't pure. When Sayaka finds out what she's become (a walking corpse) she becomes more ashamed of herself than ever before and never confesses to Kyousuke because of her shame. She has to watch Kyousuke get together with Hitomi as she fades into the background forever, and this is too much for her to take. From here, she tries to maintain this idea of ""fighting for justice"" in her head and being different from the other magical girls, but she realizes that it's all a facade and that she's become a monster, and was not as selfless as she thought from the beginning. Moments after coming to terms with this, her soul gem shatters and she becomes a witch. Sayaka was not evil, she was human. Her arc is so impact-full because all the mistakes and decisions she made were human, which led to her becoming a monster. That's strong writing. 
Mami didn’t get a lot of time in the series. She was killed off early in episode 3, but even with such a short amount of time spent in the series, Mami was able to convey very interesting ideas, and served a very strong purpose both for the plot and the characters to advance. Mami always fought alone and put up a strong front in order to seem like a role model, and a capable protector. Her character design, voice actress and fighting style were meant to embody grace. However before going to fight Charlotte, Mami reveals to us how weak she’s really been on the inside. The loneliness of being a Magical Girl has been taking a massive toll on her, and hearing Madoka say that she would become a Magical Girl just to fight alongside her made Mami reveal her weaker side. In Mami’s case, this was a huge moment and promised a brighter future where she didn’t have to be so strong. Where she was allowed to rely on others and not shoulder the burden herself. For dropping her guard like this, the show brutally punishes her and makes an example to the other characters and the audience of what it means to be a magical girl in this world. 
Kyoko, unlike past examples, is not character the show punishes for her mistakes but rather, she punishes herself for her own mistakes. When she wasted her wish not truly knowing what the other person wanted, it ended in complete disaster. The lesson Kyoko learns from this is that people can never truly understand each other. That kind of connection simply can’t exist. So she decided that she would do everything for her own sake. Kyoko’s case was especially unfortunate, because she was doomed to despair right from the beginning, and tried to survive for the sake of surviving after that. The only hope she clung onto, was the hope to live again the next day. Although this was an effective means of survival, Kyoko realizes what she lacks when she first fights Sayaka. Sayaka fights a losing battle and doesn’t go down. Seeing Sayaka passionately fight to survive, and doing so because she wants to live for others made Kyoko realize how lifelessly she’s been surviving. The most unfortunate part about this was that she saw a role model in Sayaka which Sayaka failed to see herself. Kyoko met one of the most fitting ends in my opinion. After seeing Sayaka suffer alone she makes one last attempt to try and save her. She finally is fighting for other people’s sake again, and she died doing it. 
And Finally, best girl herself Homura. I wholeheartedly believe that Akemi Homura is one of the strongest characters written in anime. That, of course, is entirely my personal preference, there are plenty of strongly written characters in this show, let alone all of anime, but I put her up on that pedestal with good reasoning. Throughout the show, Homura is a mysterious character with a weird obsession to Madoka and her becoming a magical girl. However, what is immediately recognizable in Homura is the fact that her methods are crazy, but she gives the audience the impression that you need to trust her despite that. She is clearly trying to warn and protect Madoka, so she may be a good person after all. Also we can immediately tell that she’s a fuckin badass, but I digress. When Homura’s backstory is revealed, not only does everything fall into place about her character, but she immediately becomes such a fleshed out character who you can’t help but sympathize with. Seeing her transformation from innocence to pure determination is a compelling arc, told in just one episode. The amount of suffering Homura has gone through could never be understood by anyone, and it has completely transformed her. Although we can understand and sympathize with Homura now, she is not a good person. At least not anymore. A lot of people misunderstand this reveal and start believing Homura is the real hero of the story, but that isn’t the case. Homura’s trauma has turned her into a bad person. She has become obsessed with saving Madoka, and only sees that goal ahead of her. She was willing to kill Sayaka and anyone else who got in her way. So although the reveal helps us understand Homura’s motivations (which are reasonable) she is still an anti hero at best. But after all she’s been through, it makes sense to root for her. We’ve seen the struggle of despair and hope in so many characters up until this point, only to be revealed that Homura had been fighting the hardest against despair the whole time. The sheer injustice of Homura’s story makes her such a strong character. When you rewatch the series, you start to notice all of these moments where you realize how much pain Homura must have felt. Like hearing Madoka call her by her last name instead of “Homura”, or when Madoka says that she will never forget Mami, and Homura’s jealousy of that statement shines through. Most tragic of all is the ending that Homura gets. In a sense, it’s fitting and poetic. By ascending to God status, Madoka sees all of the timelines Homura went through to save her, and she embraces Homura like she always wanted. On top of this, by some miracle Homura is the only one who’s memory of Madoka is not erased. However, Homura is not only separated from Madoka, but also never fulfills her promise to protect Madoka, and instead decides to continue to protect the earth Madoka fought for. Homura, at her core, is strong-willed. Her ending, although quite sad, is also fitting especially to her. She is strong enough to never forget Madoka, and so she is strong enough to never stop fighting for her world. One day, she will be united with Madoka in the new Law of the Cycle, but until that day Homura does what she’s learned to do best, which is to persevere. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Do I even need to sell this any further? There’s a reason I keep going back to this series over and over. There’s a reason I felt compelled to write a review for this show and there’s a reason I gave it a 10/10. This show does everything it wants to, and does it perfectly. The aesthetic, the creative take on Magical Girls, the complex and interesting characters, the amazingly animated fight scenes, the badass soundtrack and VA performances. It’s all simply perfect. I know I said it isn't perfect at the beginning of this review, but I don't care. I changed my mind. It's fucking perfect. Studio Shaft really outdid themselves on this show, and it instantly brought Akiyuki Shinbo into my favourites for people in the anime industry. And with all of the respect I have for this show, I was unbelievably shocked when I watched the Movie “Rebellion”, which just skyrocketed the respect I had for this series. I will surely be doing a review on that show as well, but until then, I hope I was able to help some people (who are very late to the party) understand all the hype that the show gets. It’s well warranted. This show is a masterpiece.

    Hello, we have ourselves something interesting and relatively new as far as the cliche setting goes. Let's start by saying what this is in terms of genre. You will have your typical teenager coming over to another world. Elves, demons, magic, medieval times - as far as this goes we've all seen this before. However, as far as recommending this I would tell almost everyone to watch it. It doesn't matter if you like this type of show, it's not the dominant trait of it. But let's explain everything like I usually do. 
 
Watch if: 
 
- You generally like shounen-type anime, 
 
- Your idea of watching something involves understanding and thinking,

Story 9/10 
 
My personal ranking as far as story goes rates this anime very high. Probably on par with things like ""Death Note"" and ""Madoka Magica"". Do not look for similarities in terms of setting or even the story itself there, though. What I mean by this is that I believe the idea for the anime is great and somewhat unique. This is inevitably tied to both story and characters, but I will put my thoughts down here - before you get bored of reading. 
 
The main concept (apart from ""person in another world"") here is that the protagonist will ressurect after death. Not only that, but he will turn back time as well. The idea is easiest explained as an ""auto-save"" feature in real life. He will go back to a point, remember all his choices and will be able to change events somewhat. There are two ways I found one might look at it. You could treat this as the typical hero power an MC gets in this type of story, but I believe that to be incorrect. Another way of looking at it, as I believe the creators might have intended, is that the guy has no special features about him. He isn't some long lost prince, has no sword coming out of his butt or a magical eye that strips females of their wits and garments. There is some kind of curse on him (let's call it auto-save curse) and he will make the best of that bad situation. What you typically see in shows of this genre is the hero making choices that are ALWAYS correct. If you ever thought outside the proverbial box while watching the genre you'd have at some point asked yourself at least one of the below (or a variation of it): 
 
- ""How does he always get to the right place, how does he even know where to go?"" 
 
- ""How come he talks to this person he just met like they know eachother forever and gives them advice?"" 
 
- ""Seriously, you just got to this world... why do you know everything and do the right thing every single time? Can you read their minds?"" 
 
For me it's utterly frustrating that heroes just come and take the reins, guiding everyone, including the viewer through the cliche plot without a single hiccup. Like, ""Ok, so I am in this world, and we need to kill the demon lord"" - 15 episodes later they are at the demon lord castle, walking to his throne room. How did he even know which way it was... 
 
In this show you get to see what an actual human being might do, if put in the same situation. He will make MISTAKES. Luckily his ""auto-save"" lets him try and try again until he gets it right, or as close to that as possible given the circumstances. If you never thought about the above cliche you will after you watch this show. This is also the most compelling reason for watching that I can give you. 
 
Animation 8/10 
 
Visuals are stunning. It's pretty, it's colorful, things are animated and move almost like they should. Given some of the gore I feel it might have been a smart idea by the animators to deliberately conceal some of the more gruesome shots - we get to avoid the omnipresent Rays of Light(Tm), while at the same time we know what happened. Some parts might be too light-hearted and maybe attention to detail could have been better with the scenery, but there really is nothing to complain about. You will find that it's pretty, I promise. 
 
Sound 7/10 
 
I loved the OP, most of it anyway. There's absolutely noting bad to say about the VA's as well. Sound is not intrusive, it plays its role, builds up tension and helps the overall vibe. While it is the lowest point of the show, that is only because everything else is so great. 
 
Characters 9/10 
 
Bread and butter of the series. While the idea and story are both amazing, they would not work without the characters. The MC is actually a typical teenager. They made him a bit too dense, but that is most likely so he doesn't intimidate teenage viewers and they don't feel too inferior. Most any teenager should be able to relate to him, given the fact he has no special powers and tends to actually have emotions that resemble a human being. While this sounds negative, it is far from it. Most shows present you with a sock puppet that will headbutt walls, peek on girls and shout out skill names while disposing of enemies. This guy thinks, analyzes, makes mistakes and LEARNS from them. He is also a role model type, so it's safe to let your teenager watch this, if you're a parent. 
 
Characters have layers, but are not rushing to the MC to tell him their life story. They tend to be very secretive and through decent plot manipulation (and use of ""auto-save"") the MC gets to discover that some are not what they seem. Genuine relationships develop, sometimes cut short but the MC dying and such. 
 
Overall 8/10 
 
This is a show that everyone should at least try. No matter if you're just looking for a casual shounen or you'd like to explore the more interesting aspects of it, this anime will deliver. The only downside is that clever use of cliffhangers makes you want more. As such, for those who hate waiting to see what happens, one might need to wait for all 26 episodes. 
 
Wholeheartedly recommended.

    This is my first time make a review. Just a short, simple review about Durarara(DRRR). 
This is an anime with a wonderful and unique storyline.  
 
STORY-9/10: The story revolves around people with distinctive background who reside in a city named Ikebukuro. Despite how they go through their daily lives are different, they converge to a point that we do not expect. This element that makes this story is unique. Why I rated 9? It is due to its slow-paced beginning. But I promised you that it is exciting after a several episodes 
 
CHARACTER-10/10: The characters development is beautiful because the development of every character is divided fairly, until that we are kind of confused know who is the main character in this story. They also voiced by talented seiyuu.  
 
ART-8/10 
 
We must have patience first of all to go through the slow-paced beginning.

    Artistic direction and music were very good and definitely well executed. 
For me the subject matter ruined the experience. 
 
I can deal with the cliche of pervy guys checking out girls, but there's a huge degree of casual objectification going on in the anime. Far too many fan-service moments that made the experience unpleasant.  
 
Not a lot of character development from the episodes I've seen either, yes there is a strong friendship but their initial crime is inherently wrong and none of them learn from the experience. 
 
Shame, as the art direction and music could of made this a solid piece if only the story was character focussed rather than showing down-blouse or in between the crotch camera shots.

    If you saw the beginning, you saw the first episode, I bet most of you were like, ""TWINCEST. YES. TWINCEST. OH. YES."" or something like that. ...Well maybe your reaction was slightly different. 
 
But after you see the second episode, you kinda get this feeling of anime: 
 
The ones with the boy, who is attractive in some way to the other female characters. He goes around and kisses each of the girls, each in a different arc (becuase it would be wrong if it were in the same arc, wouldn't it?! heh.), making them fall for him, they have sex, and then he moves on, and it just goes on until he's tapped all the girls in the anime. 
 
...hey, I could be totally wrong, can't I? It is only the fourth episode. Things can change. Hopefully, it will. 
 
As for art and sound, they're both really good. Music sets a good, calm, solitude kinda of feeling and the art can be good, but can be crappy at times as well.  
 
And the characters...well...they don't seem to have any personalities on them. Especially Haruka, the protagonist. He hasn't even shown a bit of personality. Okay, maybe a bit, but so far we don't really know what kind of guy he is.

    This review is written in hindsight, but I cannot LOVE  this series anymore. The enemy is far from complex. There is virtually no character development, but it’s not completely nonexistent either. The characters are one dimensional and you know what: I DON'T CARE! I am here for the hot mech on mech action. Like Argevollen, nothing anyone could say or do could change my mind about this series. I am the target audience: cool character designs, cool mecha, and a story of how they are part of a much larger conflict. I’m tired of the mecha genre trying too hard to find deeper meaning in a series that’s about giant robots battling one another. Or focusing on the emotions of the pilot. Mecha show aren’t about an emotional journey. They’re about firepower. I don't like to throw out tens like they are Mardi Gras beads, but this series renewed my faith in the mecha genre, especially after Gunam Seed. No one is whining or crying over their fate. They have a purpose and they fulfill it. They’re soldiers first, kids second. Plus it’s a visual treat, it’s very pretty to look at even if certain animations are repeated. Plus I love the fact that it’s co-ed (something I wish more anime were) the girls and boys serve equally in all areas. If you’re a fan of the mecha genre then I highly recommend this series.

    I would consider Binbougami as the best parody. Binbougami manage to mix the story and character development to the parody which made things better. 
 
Story - 8 
 
Binbougami story is simple. Beside from whats written on the synopsis, it also deals with everyday life of Sakura Ichiko. While it seems to be simple, that didnt appear to be as simple as it is for the MC of this show is a loner. To put it simply, the story of Binbougami is more like the story of a very fortunate lonely girl learn to interact with other people while being keep in watch by a God of Misfortune.  
 
It is also to take note the amount of parody this anime has. The parody on this anime mostly use as a comedy but unlike any other parody, the parody here match the atmosphere of the events like using Dragonball parody for introducing the characters. It is also very interesting that the 2 most memorable anime Spirited Away and Death Note used as well for the parody. 
 
Songs - 8 
 
Catchy. Well the songs on Binbougami has its own merits. Like its opening song, its very catchy and thanks to that catchy song, it helps to improve the atmosphere of the anime.  
 
The ending song of the other hand shows the hate/love relationship between Ichiko and Momiji. Which sounds cute. Yeah it sounds cute case of the beat of the song and even the translation of the lyrics makes it cute as well. 
 
Character - 7 
 
The best way to describe this part is this resemble Seto no Hanayome characters. Yes it totally resemble Seto no Hanayome when it comes to the characters. Even the character development resembles Seto no Hanayome. 
 
In case those who read this review havent seen Seto no Hanayome, its a romcom anime that has characters as one of its strong factor. 
 
Overall - 8 
 
This never failed to make me laugh so I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for comedy anime. 
 
Hope that this opinion of mine is helpful.

    Wish I had fake powers . . . 
 
Pros:  
 
- The characters are very likeable, at first I thought they were all just going to be cute cookie cutter characters but no I nearly enjoyed all of them 
- I recommend watching the dub as it gives a much more serious tone to Rikka giving her a better 3 dimensional persona 
- Touka Takanashi #e . e# she sooo . . . 
- Their antics are freaking hilarious, I felt like I was back in elementary with some good friends role playing > . > what I had friends 
- Great chemistry over most of the characters 
 
Cons:  
 
- A few characters I could have done without 
- Needs more ""Good"" male characters, tis a taco fest here > . > 
- Some jokes do end up repeating as well as interactions between characters 
- In need of better written events to happen 
 
Summary:  
 
Great anime, great laughs, and a great time. I was actually surprised by how much I liked all the characters minus one guy. One of them in particular made a good impression on me as she was a character I disliked for thinking she was just gonna be a cliche but it did 180 and screwed with my perception. ( Nice one writer ) Anywho go watch this anime but be warned you might start monologing yourself.

    Lemme put in my own opinion... 
 
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is perhaps... Screw that, THE most over the top thing you will likely see for a while. You know that whole &quot;OVER 9000!!&quot; Meme on the internet? In here it's more like &quot;OVER 999999999...!&quot; and going onwards. 
 
Let's get in the meat of the stuff. 
 
 
Story: The story is basically about a kid named Simon and how he goes from the sidekick of suicidally courageous moron Kamina to asskicker extraordinaire in a journey riddled with Mecha, asskicking and believing in yourself so much that your enemies will be wiped out by your awesomeness. The plot is divided into two parts. The first is about Simon as a young child and growing badass while the second is about Simon as a young adult reaching the pinnacle of his badassedness. Not gonna give any more details in case of spoilers. 
 
Everything is standard anime cliche take to the extreme, particularly the whole &quot;DETERMINATION TRUMPS ALLl!&quot; and &quot;WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS AND YOU ALL SUCK!! MUA HA HA!!!&quot;. This is defined by the catchphrases &quot;Beyond the Impossible&quot; and &quot;Kick Reason to the Curb&quot;. I myself have quite the distaste for those tropes and as such found everything involving such as parody and I would describe this as the &quot;Feel Good Comedy of the Year&quot;. 
 
Art: The artstyle and animation is amazingly exaggerated. The Mecha designs are unique and weird in a fun  and wacky way. Since this is Gainax do expect the females to have that extra bounce (Giggedy), especially Yoko, whose costume is usually limited to bras and skirts/spanky pants. The fight scenes are incredibly well-done as well as insane. Chances are people watching this will have the reactions of &quot;HOLY DAMN THAT WAS AWESOME!&quot; to &quot;DID HE JUST DO THAT?!&quot;. That seems to be the popular consensus. 
 
Sound: There's a lot of inspirational shouting as well as music to pump you up for the mood. A repeated line in the songs of the later parts of the series is &quot;Row row fight the powah!&quot; which sort of fits into the stuff. Voice Acting is decent enough for the inspirational shouting, with the classic monologues being done by Kamina, whose talents include making big gestures and dramataic speeches and... That's about it... 
 
Characters: Do expect some cliches here and there. Kamina is the basic &quot;Shonen Hero with a will of pure adamantium laced with whatever indestructive material&quot; and is insanely overdramatic. Unfortunately (in my opinion) he lacks the wits for anything and as thus is incredibly reckless and suicidal but has the charisma to have people be as sucidial as him. Simon, his lackey and the true main character of the series eventually takes after him in this effect, but still maintains common sense (which Kamina seems to abhor).  
 
There are other characters such as Rossiu, Simon's companion whom they meet and serves as the cool-headed intelligent one, Yoko, the female lead of the series and the provider of approximately 90% of the fanservice since (as mentioned above) she wears nothing but a bra and some skirts/spanky pants, Viral who serves as a rival to Kamina and eventually Simon, Nia who serves as Simon's love interest and a whole bunch of other side characters who I cannot bother remembering. A few tend to serve as &quot;Guy who is there&quot; and serve no important role save for being part of Kamina/Simon's Redshirt Army so don't bother attempting to remember all their names. 
 
Enjoyment: Despite some criticisms I had a grand time watching the series. It filled me with an amused feeling that I rarely get from other shows. I'm not going to bother rewatching the series though since I rarely rewatch/reread stuff. 
 
Overall, this is a fun series for those who are not willing to take everything seriously and just take it as something to be watched for fun. As a non-fan of most Mecha series I liked everything. I recommend it for anybody just wishing to find something fun to watch, though don't try to find any thought-provoking arguments/philosophies behind it all.

    (This is a review for both seasons of the show, as they don’t really work as stand-alone pieces and it wouldn’t be useful to review them as such. That said, no spoilers for either series is in this review, so it is generally safe reading) 
 
Setting up a premise for Concrete Revolutio is almost impossible. The plot threads of this series twist and articulate in almost imperscrutable webs, changing the narrative landscape of the series in almost every episode. As a narrative technique this is a double-edged sword, while on one hand, it makes for an almost mesmerizing viewing experience, as events unfold in front of our eyes in unpredictable ways, its borderline nonsensical twists reinforcing the fundamental powerlessness of the protagonists in the face of systems way bigger than them; on the other it can make for a story that is very challenging to follow as a linear plot, given that the viewer is required to pay attention to every single line of dialogue, while at the same time being careful to remember each flash-back and flash-forward, even those originally shown with no context. 
 
To try and sum it up, at its core Concrete Revolutio uses an alternate version of post-war Japan, where both humans and super-human exist, as the backdrop for a story about political allegiance, insecurity and the difficulty of discerning an abstract concept of righteousness (or JUSTICE!) in an era of information overload. Each episode generally follows the “super-human bureau”, an organization which purpose is to both protect super-humans and protect humans from super-humans, dealing with relatively self-contained issues, while flash-backs and flash-forward are used to both expand on the core themes of each episode, and to weave the self-contained events in a wider narrative tapestry. 
 
While the repeated and constant use of the word “JUSTICE!” and the subtly comic book inspired art style of the backgrounds, might make Concrete Revolutio a good fit to be slotted within the rising trend of western-superhero inspired anime, both is theming and aesthetic, when looked at closer, seem to be more deep-rooted in Japan that one might expect. Super-humans in this case, are not simply a transposition of western superhero tropes. The term is instead used as an umbrella for any kind of fantasy fiction trope, from aliens and yokai, to sentai heroes and robots. Aesthetically this makes for a very interesting choice, as the series often plays on contrasting the complex morality of its narrative, with fights that seem borrowed directly from the overactive imagination of a cartoon-loving Japanese kid, with clear stand-ins for iconic fictional figures like Daitan III or Godzilla, facing each other in big monster fights.  
 
This conflict between innocent ideals and the complexities of reality is one of the themes at the core of the series, as idealistic characters end up facing a reality made of hidden motives and overly intricate plots in a manner that can be reminiscent of some weird overlapping of the themes of Metal Gear Solid 2 and the original Gundam. 
 
Unlike Metal Gear Solid 2 though, Concrete Revolutio doesn’t just outline a world where the control of information frames righteousness and the overload of information makes it so that it is basically impossible to discern schemes from truths, but goes one step further, diving deep into the insecurities and paranoia that that environment creates, in a more personal and character-driven way. This approach works quite well, as it avoids the cliché “innocence lost” kind of character arc, which seemed what the series was going for in the first couple of episodes, instead developing in the way more interesting direction of characters having to grapple with their failability, and the failability of the systems they uphold, making for portraits of doubt and paranoia that are quite relatable in the current political climate. 
 
The series uses its episodic nature to also relate to many other themes, from the capitalistic exploitation of minorities, to PTSD, to imperialism. The results of this are generally varying, as some episodes are bound to be better executed than others. Really, the main flaw of Concrete Revolutio, aside from the fact that the plot can sometimes be a bit difficult to follow, is that it seems to try to tackle too many things without then successfully managing to pull them together in one thread, which makes a great part of the series feel a bit scattershot. 
 
While the trick of Concrete Revolution is to willingly confuse the viewer by flashing a multitude of unrelated concepts and plots, in order to replicate the hopeless struggle for truth of its protagonists, some of those plots end up feeling a bit redundant and odd even in that context. While the number of episodes the series got is pretty much perfect (24 episodes divided into 2 seasons), allowing it to drive its points home without overstaying its welcome, it would have been nice if a couple of the most “out there” bits were trimmed, in favour of more exploration of the main characters. 
 
Ultimately, it should be noted that I do not have the historical knowledge to trace any comparison between Concrete Revolutio and the politics of actual post-war Japan, but I can say that the core themes that the series engages with are perfectly relevant and relatable even in the present.  
 
Carried by writing that feels untypically personal for a mainstream anime, Concrete Revolutio is a fittingly harrowing meditation on what it means to try to do good in a world where truth can be easily manipulated and the systems themselves feel broken. While not all of it always work, and the tone can sometimes bounce around a bit too much, it is, in the end, an extremely interesting series that might have flown maybe a bit too much under the radar when it was originally released.  
 
Cool. Good. Watch it.

    Hello, minna-san! 
Here i am with my review on Senyuu. 
 
When i first read the synopsis i wasn't really sure if i wanted to watch it. My expectations were somewhat low, but that was only before i turned on the first episode. 
 
If there is love from the first sight, than Senyuu is the case. I never imagined that action about heroes and saving the world could be THAT funny. You would usually expect some drama, some pathos, lots of fighting and pinches, really strong good and bad guys.. With Senyuu it was quite different.  
 
Actually the first thing you should know about this anime is that you are gonna laugh a lot. Each episode is aproximately 5 min long, and during this time you are really unlikely to stop laughing or, at least, smiling. 
 
THE CHARACTERS 
What i really love about this anime, apart from its humour, is the characters. Even though episodes are short and there's only 13 of them, you will get a pretty good idea about their personalities. Their design is pretty much interesting and fits in anime's style really well. I also loved the naming, f.e. the 12 demons are named after name of a month and its number in german, like Ein Januar, Zwei Februar, etc. 
Voice actors did really good job as well.  
 
THE STORY 
The main point in this anime is its jokes, so it's more about dialogs and different comic situations, than about story. Though something was really going on in the series, the story hadn't proceeded much in the first season. But that's hardly a bad point, and the only thing a wished for was not more story, but more episodes. 
 
THE ART 
The art actually is pretty simble, but that's expected of the anime that's about comedy and parody. As for me it's not really inportant whether the art is simplistic or glamouros or whatever. What really matters is whether it fits the idea of the anime or not. Senyuu's art surely does fit, 'cause funny anime must have funny art. 
 
THE SOUND 
The sound was somewhat cheerful, though i didn't pay much attention to it. Guess that's a good thing, hm. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
As for me it was really enjoyable. If you're feeling down, you must watch it and you'll feel much better. If you're not feeling down, you still must watch it and again you will be in a better mood.  
 
The second season of Senyuu is airing this july and i'm really really really looking forward to it.

    [STORY: 3/10] 
Fitting a series that is around twenty hours long into just the length of this film is ridiculous. It doesn't do any of it justice and should only be watched if you must see Clannad, but don't have enough time for the actual show. The character development and story take a huge hit here. 
 
[ART: 5/10] 
About as good as the show's animation, but here it should be better due to its existence as a film. A show can get away with a bit of lackluster art, but a film that will only be around one to two hours has no excuse. 
 
[SOUND: 5/10] 
Not much to say about sound, it isn't anything spectacular, nor is it anything horrid. It works, but for a film, it feels as lackluster as the animation. 
 
[CHARACTER: 4/10] 
With this movie cutting out a majority of the character development present in the show, it leaves us with characters we are indifferent towards. We can't see them grow very much, and that's what slice-of-life will usually depend on so that it isn't just a show about boring, everyday life. 
 
[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 4/10] 
This movie isn't one I could easily recommend to anybody unless they are short on time. With it lacking in almost every department, it's sadly a below average mess and can't compete with the source material it is based on.

    What would you expect from reLIFE? A guy transforming back into his teens to retake high school. That sentence doesn't sound that interesting but the anime is actually better. 
 
So there is an organisation that has a purpose to ""rehabilitate"" old people who are no good in society? It isn't clearly stated but that seems to be their purpose. If you don't look into the logistics of making your body younger while maintaining the insides of an old person then the anime is quite enjoyable up to a certain point. The character developement and backstory that was introduced in the beggining is actually interesting, it differs from a normal slice of life because it gives you the view from an old person who has already done that stuff. He tries to befriend classmates and socialises and rethinks his life. There is also some cool lore about the organisation and a mystery about the previous subject. Half way through it sadly messes up pretty bad. It wavers from the main story line and starts focusing on other characters. If they had some small influence over a couple of episodes then it would be fine but they get full episodes dedicated to their backstorys and that is complete poop. 
 
The story progressed so well in the first 3 episodes with enjoyable character developement, information about the lore and plot moved on, they just stabbed themselves in the leg when they wanted to focus more on the other classmates. 
 
You can also check out my full review on it on Youtube and maybe give some feedback which is greatly needed to improve my channel at MudanTV ReLIFE Anime Review

    So this anime called Kanon, is really hard to write a review on without a spoiler. Then i will try not to. Overall this anime was perfect. I couldnt find almost anything wrong with it, it flowed very well. Along with the art and sound it just made it better. The characters were pretty well done. It starts off with a non-hooking first episode. Its kinda wierd, it didnt have anything besides the main character Yuicchi, going to his cousins house. Its like if i didnt hear anything good about it, and watched the first episode i probably wouldnt continue. But if your going to start it, continue, really this anime was amazing. Some people may disagree or agree with me on the first episode. But i really sat there like soooo whats happening? 
 
I would suggest to almost anyone besides those Shonen Straight out action guys whos favorites are Naruto, One Piece, and Dragon Ball Z.  
 
Have fun watching!

    Story 
Date A Live opens with Japan’s favorite fetish: mass destruction. It then follows that with Japan’s second favorite fetish: little sister love. The anime’s opening episode introduces us to the idea of spirits and spacequakes. Spirits are…some sort of creatures that have super powers and aren’t actually explained all that well. Their appearance causes spacequakes. To combat spirits and the subsequent quakes, Japan has a ground defense force that employs young girls who wear battle gear that look more like Hyperdimension Neptunia armor designs than actual military armor. 
 
Our main character, Shido, goes out during a spacequake to save his sister, only to magically survive the devastating encounter and meet a young spirit; a girl who doesn’t feel that she belongs. This first episode gives you the impression the anime has potential, but the second episode decides to throw that potential out the window and engage in typical harem antics with a splash of nonsensical and a few shakes of stupid. 
 
It turns out Shido’s sister is really the commander of a space ship and the goal of the crew is to make the spirits fall in love with Shido so that he holds their powers in check and they become real girls. So Shido goes out on dates with cute girls while his sister tells him what to say through an earpiece. 
 
Decisions on what he says are made through a dating game style choice system and from there I’m going to quit explaining and start complaining. 
 
The series doesn’t have an exceptional plot. It borrows heavily from other, more entertaining series to create a watchable, but wholly unimpressive piece. There are some somewhat funny moments and some decent drama, but the problem is the series doesn’t understand what it wants to be. In a typical harem/ecchi you either choose to be funny or choose to focus on story or balance both. Date A Live does none of the above and teeters to both sides in an awkward and sometimes annoying way. It also doesn’t help that the anime doesn’t excel in either field whatsoever. The comedy isn’t that funny and the story is very predictable. 
 
As far as story goes, Date A Live neglects substance in the hope you can look past that and just worry about the cute girls. 
 
Animation 
Yes, the girls are goddam adorable. The character design is good for some characters, boring for others. There are some very unique looking characters, especially Kurumi. The world itself is well animated and the fight scenes are very fluid and look good. 
 
Sound 
The opening song is actually pretty good, though the ending fails to impress. Music during the show is typical of the genre. Voice acting is good. There’s nothing impressive to be found here. 
 
Characters 
Date A Live doesn’t have bad characters, it just has generic characters. None of them particularly stand out except, once again, Kurumi. She’s an interesting character to have in a harem anime like this because of how batshit insane she is. Her power is also cool, as well as her eyes. But that’s not what the point is. 
 
The point is that Tohka is the hungry, ditzy, doesn’t know much of anything character. Yoshino is the scaredy-cat loli. Kotori is the tsundere. Kurumi is the yandere. 
 
And rounding it all out is Shido, a character who can do no wrong, protects a girl who violently murders people in front of him, and doesn’t have any problem with kissing his sister. He’s the same goddam character you can change out with half the harem titles on the market. 
 
I’m sick of being sick of these characters because I’ve spent about one hundred percent of my reviews complaining about them. Aren’t there other tropes? Isn’t there something new, or at least a typical character that is developed to such depth that they become memorable? 
 
Overall 
I don’t hate Date A Live, in fact I wanted to like it. The plot could have been a lot better if it neglected the comedy and focused on the proper story. The story wouldn’t have benefitted much, but it would have made a much better product. 
 
The thing about this series is that I can’t hate it. It’s not so reprehensible as to be unwatchable, it’s just another average series floating around the stagnant pool of harem comedies. There are much better examples of the genre, but there are, of course, much worse. Fans of the harem/ecchi genre will probably appreciate the series while everyone else will want to stand back and watch something with a little more depth. I enjoyed enough of it to warrant the rating I’m giving it, though you may find it a tad more underwhelming, or you may be pulled in by cute girls (if that’s your thing) and won’t be able to wait for the second season. 
 
For me, it blew some time, and it kept me moderately engaged for four hours. It’s not a classic, but it’s decent enough.

    Death Note was an excessively suspenseful anime full of excitement and thrill. Although the ending had been a little abrupt, if you rewatch it a couple of times, you might see the beauty of what this anime possesses. Each individual character had unique characteristics, which made delighted me even more. The plot was extremely planned out well; young Light Yagami finds a sole Death Note and starts creating schemes to extinguish evil from the world. He is considered as the &quot;best&quot; in Japan and therefore, he has a brilliant mind that prevents him from being captured by polices. Yet, the ICPO (otherwise similar to the FBI and the CIA) brings out their ultimate detective to solve this case. The detective, otherwise nicknamed as &quot;L,&quot; tries his best with logical explanations to step-by-step capture Light and pause his killings. Outside, they are very renown friends; yet, through the real world, both are major threats and they compete to relinquish the other. In all, Death Note is definitely an outstanding anime and therefore you should turn go ahead, turn on your TV or your computer and enjoy yourself with this award-winning animation.

    There comes a time when you've watched a few shows of the same genre that you unconsciously start to compare new shows to those that have come before them. Sports anime in particular is a hard genre to kick this habit, particularly because many of the same tropes are used throughout each show's plot. In Haikyuu's case, these comparisons actually raised the show up in my eyes as I watched this highly enjoyable spectacle do many of these tropes better than shows previous.  
 
Keep in mind that I have only seen a handful of sports anime in the five years I've been watching anime. But Haikyuu does hit many of the same beats that Kuroko no Basuke does; as such I will be referencing that show to some extent throughout the review.  
 
The biggest hindrance of Haikyuu is the plot's predictability, as it does incorporate many familiar tropes of sports anime into its story. We have the underdog sports team hoping to claim national glory. We have the slightly weak new first year coupled with the prodigy first year. Training camps happen and the all important Inter High tournament comes up in the second half. All in all, the plot of Haikyuu proceeds in typical sports anime fashion and while the action is certainly captivating the outcome of certain matches can be all too predictable. Once you learn that there are two national tournaments a year in volleyball, those familiar with Kuroko no Basuke's plot can easily predict how the Karasuno team will fair in the Inter High tournament. . It’s harsh to judge an anime like this on predictability because the beats it follows are the beats of sports anime, but it does detract a little from the drama when you can already predict the outcome. 
 
However, a major boon to the series is its action sequences. Beautifully animated and directed, the show pulls you right in as soon as the first serve flies and you're captivated for the rest of the match. The plays are fast paced and each serve is action packed with drama. Here in Haikyuu, while some plays are flashy, the show does a wonderful job in making you believe these plays could be done on the real world by real people. This is in contrast to Kuroko; while a wonderful show, throughout it I kept thinking to myself that no real person could actually pull off most of the plays the Generation of Miracles did. The show also does a superb job in explaining the basic rules of volleyball for those who, like me, have no experience with the sport. 
 
The characters are also well done throughout. Though most of them are fairly one dimensional, its truly a marvel to watch these players come together on the court to form a functioning team. You can feel it when they are happy, excited, and sad. Kageyama is the only one who really has any development this season, but it is desperately needed because of the background he's coming from. All of the others have fairly hilarious personalities and their interactions with each other provide most of the comic relief.  
 
Lastly, I come to the art and sound. The soundtrack fades in fairly well with the action and quite good overall; the openings and endings are also decent. The voice acting is fantastic as well. The true gem though is the animation, which is overall very tight and well defined and frankly quite beautiful. The color palate is soft but the colors stand out well, especially brighter colors like Hinata's hair. The direction is simply superb, especially during action sequences.  
 
Overall, this ride with Haikyuu has been a long one. I had it on hold for at least a year before picking it up again in preparation for the third season; this probably just says that the first half, like most sports anime, is fairly slow, but the action does pick up in later episodes. This was riding at a 9 for a long time because of the predictability, but the top notch direction in the later episodes as well as the ending melted my cold heart enough for me to say screw it and give this thing a 10. Truly a marvel and my favorite sports anime.

    Art 
 
The art is very nice, and the characters are nicely animated. I see no problems here. 
 
Sound 
 
I don't remember particularly noticing anything about the music but since I didn't notice anything negative I gave sound an 8.  
 
Character 
 
I liked the main character especially. The other characters were fine as well it is just that personally I didn't care for them. None of them were obnoxious or annoying which is a great plus as many animes have boring characters. I just don't have anything amazing to say about them. 
 
Story 
 
The story started out really strong, but after it got midway it started to slow down and it got kind of boring and then picked up again near the end. I honestly wanted to skip some of the episodes where they were trying to develop the side characters because I couldn't care less. I wanted the story to concentrate more on the main character or at least develop the side characters alongside it rather than setting aside a few boring episodes just to develop them.  
 
Probably my favorite part about his anime was the setting though. After I finished watching it I really wanted to go to a Japanese inn and work there. The scenery was beautiful and it made me wish I was there and not stuck in my home during the cold winter season. The anime did a phenomenal job with the setting and the working environment and I commend it on that. 
 
Overall 
 
If someone is telling you that this anime is a MUST SEE don't listen to them. I don't think I'd find myself recommending this to people unless they like slice of life and are looking for a good one. It was a good show but it wasn't amazing. That said, even though it wasn't amazing I marathoned it within few days without much trouble so that's a good sign. If you want to watch a decent slice of life that isn't filled with garbage watch Hanasaku Iroha.

    This is a compact review based on all THREE seasons (78 episodes) of the Legend of Condor Hero series. 
 
*Please note that only season 1 was voiced in Japanese but all 3 seasons have been Chinese dubbed.* 
 
Before proceeding with the actual review of this anime, I would like to clarify the name of the story. Based on the original novel written in the late 1950s, this story should be called The Return of the Condor Heroes. But somewhere along the way, the Japanese decided to change the name to Legend of  Condor Hero, which to add on to the confusion is the same name as the prequel story to the story that this anime is based upon. So to sum this up, Legend of Condor Hero (anime) does NOT equal to the actual Legend of Condor Hero, but in fact, the anime is the sequel to the Legend of Condor Hero. For those who can read Kanji, check this out and everything should be clear. 
 
The Legend of Condor Hero is, to many Chinese, the Romeo and Juliet of the West. Not because the story have much in common, but rather it is the reputation that it earned over the last 50 years as a romance story. You can literally go walk to a Chinese and ask them the story of Legend of Condor Hero and 90% of the time they will be able to tell you something about it. 
 
The story revolves around Yang Guo and his lover Xiao Long Nu in their adventure against the dominating Mongolian Empire (~1250 AD) under Genghis Khan's grandson. However, what really captivates viewer to this story is the taboo/forbidden love between the two as one is the master and the other is the apprentice. 
 
While the anime adaptation follows the actual story quite closely, there were some missing characters here and there (for example, Sha Gu played a key role in providing the background story of Yang Guo's deceased father, but she was completely taken out in the anime). However, I was glad that the production crew did a good job with the crucial Battle of Xiangyang as that was the &quot;heart&quot; of the story in the actual novel. 
 
Since I have personally read the entire trilogy -the official Chinese novels- of the Condor series (The Legend of the Condor Heroes, The Return of the Condor Heroes, and The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Saber), I was expecting a lot from this anime. It failed me in many ways, from the poor animation quality, to the overly repetitive scenes and soundtracks. All in all, it was fairly decent in terms of story retelling, but for an anime in this day and age it certainly can be a whole lot better.

    So, first of all let me say one thing: If you have not yet read the manga, watching the second OVA is not recommendable as it takes place immediately after the next big arc in the manga. It thus contains major spoilers for this arc. 
Additionally you won't be able to understand the deep meaning behind these scenes under the cherry tree. 
As many over OVAs, this one, too, is aimed at the manga readers and not the anime audience. 
 
Story: 8 
It is a very precise adaption from the manga. This goes for both OVAs. They both take place between two arcs in the manga, thus there is no thick plot but instead they show hilarious scenes from the everyday lifes of the characters which sometimes have a deeper meaning if put into the correct context. 
 
Art: 9 
The art is as good in the OVAs as it is in the anime series. 
No complaints here. 
 
Sound: 9 
Opening and Ending are great, the voices fit the characters. The OST is used throughout the OVAs in a fitting way. 
 
Character: 9 
Well, I absolutely adore most of Noragami's characters. They are very unique - which is shown best by Yato in these two twenty minute OVAs. Every action is just such a typical thing for him to do. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I've loved it in the manga and I still love these scenes in the OVAs. The Second OVA was hilarious but sad at the same time, considering the previous events. 
 
Overall: 9 
It's nearly perfect, but - as expected of an OVA - it does not have any real plot. 
 
So, enjoy watching the Noragami OVAs, guys~

    Finally more Jojo!!! Another season of manliness, awesome characters and ridiculous plot. That was what I thought about Stardust Crusaders. Unfortunately the results kinda disappointed me. Let's start with the story. The plot is certainly ridiculous like the first season but it didn't have a big progress. Aside from the two first episodes which were very interesting  when the journey starts there isn't something really unique. It consists by the same structure. Ridiculous situations and the fight of the day that the good guys always win. It was still interesting to see how they would get through every ridiculous situation but  for a point on it became kind off predictable. In the art section the results were godlike. I swear 10 is not even close to describe it. The only thing that I had a problem with was the ridiculous censorship. Yeah there was censorship and that''s the only reason that I put a 9 in the art. The opening was really awesome almost as manly as the one from the first season and the ending very catchy too. The part that I had a real problem was the characters. In a Jojo adventure I don't expect character development but the characters here  were disappointing. First of all Kujo was a little bit boring protagonist . But he was still fun. The thing that frustrated me was how Joseph appeared in this anime. Ok I know it takes place 50 years after ''Battle tendency'' and Joseph wouldn't be as awesome as he used to be but still it was really disappointing to see the ingenious Joseph we knew and love turned into a comic relief. At  least we had some Dio moments but were very few I hope they show him to us more in the next season. Overall I would say that I enjoyed JBA but not nearly as much as the first season. But it was still a fun ride and I can't wait for more.

    Ah, such fond memories. Taekwon V is one of the first mecha movies I watched as a little kid and I must say I was thrilled with its fast pacing and almost non-stop action. It was the late 80’s, television was full of kid stuff, and dubbed VHS were pouring in from all sides with all sorts of animated stories the videoclubs never bothered to categorize properly. 
 
I didn’t know it back then but turns out Taekwon V is actually on of the earliest Korean anime-style rip-offs. The similarities to Mazinger Z are more than obvious (just look at the ship entering the head) but copyrights where blurry back then and nobody cared much about these low budget productions. Plus they never aired Mazinger in my country to even see the similarities and after awhile all classical robot shows copied each other and looked the same so I doubt anyone else cared to make a fuss about it. 
 
So what is this movie besides a copycat? Simple, it is fun. Fun in the way that it was made by Koreans, for Koreans, based on a foreign series which was very popular amongst children back then. It is also a stand alone movie instead of a mostly episodic series, thus the development and the revelations were coming one after another in a few minutes. Which is also something that I am not sure about; was the version I watched as a kid really only one hour long? It sure felt a lot longer to me but I was just a silly kid so I may be mistaken. You see when I recently rewatched the film, I learned that the original version was lost forever and they could only find and salvage a very corrupted copy from some warehouse. Being considered a national treasure, the government poured lots of money so they would remake it frame by frame, and thus we have the current remastered version. I know they changed the music and I am sure they redubbed the voices but the footage is basically the same… but felt going much faster. Was it really only one hour long? 
 
Anyways, the reason they went to all this trouble to remake it is basically because it was a smash hit in Korea as well as in many other countries it was exported to. The dubbed version I had as a kid didn’t seem to show it that much but turns out it was so successful basically because it was oozing with patriotism. I mean, damn, it is almost considered propaganda the way they glorify Korea in here. First it promotes martial arts and especially Tae kwon do, of which they are very proud of. Then it presents all people from other nations (Japan, India, America, Russia) to be either ugly or stupid. Finally it sets the country where the robot is to be Korea (you clearly see the flags and hear the name) and has the characters drawn in a rather familiar to their animation style way (eyes, lips, hands) to make it feel very keen to their culture. 
 
Of course I had never realized all that as a kid and even if I had I am not Korean to give a damn. The reason I liked it so much was simply because it wasn’t fooling around at all. The action and the revelations were non-stop and the movie only lasts one hour (or at least the remastered version does) so kids would not be bored with it. Also, despite being a silly story about robots and martial arts, it had many things going on in it so it didn’t feel simplistic at all. Although the basic scenario is (just like in Mazinger) a mad scientist trying to take over the world with robots and another scientist building his own to stop him, there were also many other side stories going on to flavour it. There was for example a martial arts tournament, where the protagonists competes in Tae Kwon Do. We get some fighting choreography regarding that (crude but it’s there) where sports and fair play and training hard are promoted. It is very motivational and dynamic for kids. Then there is another side story with the daughter of the mad scientist, who is torn between being treated as a cyborg (yes, she is artificial) or as a human being. There is a part where the protagonist tries to cheer her and his platonic girlfriend gets mad and offends her, thus turns her to the dark side. As a cyborg, she also fights with a fencing sword (more sports) that shoots electricity. Then there is the good scientist who is a pacifist and who has these notions of fighting only for protecting. Then there is a sub plot where the villains kidnap athletes who lost in their championships because it would be far easier to lure losers into working for them for glory and revenge. And there are actually twists to all the above. Crude and rushed but they are there. You simply can’t ignore the rich context. 
 
Let’s suppose you don’t like the context (shame on you). The action part is also very good for its time. Based on various martial arts and classic robot attacks, there is a great variety in how the characters fight. Punching, slashing, burning, crushing, stomping, you name it, verbal psychological warfare; even pepper spray is used! You get martial artists, gunners, cyborgs, tanks, airplanes, giant robots, and teapot comic reliefs. There is even variety in backgrounds; you get arenas, cities, deserts, pyramids, Chinese dragons up in the skies; man this is a blast. 
 
And let me clarify that as cool as all the above sound, the production values are poor, even for the time the movie was made. You can find continuity errors, repeated footage, crude motions, unimpressive voice acting, and the like. If you are to be bitches about it and judge the movie based on all that, then you will hate it with all you got. It doesn’t look nice at all, ok? It is the fun behind all that that I am talking about. No fillers, no linear scenario, no dried up presentation, and lots of patriotism, vividness, and passion, all taking place in roughly one hour. You can find all that if you see past the obvious. 
 
Although it is very hard to enjoy the movie if you are spoiled on recent series, in case you are willing to look for fast fun and passion in an otherwise silly robot movie, then I highly recommend it. It would be awesome if it lasted twice as much and had ten times more budget but I liked it a lot even as it is.

    Legend of Duo cannot be explained with mere words, for it is something out of this world.  
 
A feast to your eyes, like a fish still twitching with the last breath of it's life, as you impale it with your mighty fork and then shove it into your eye socket. A true feast, like no other. 
 
Of sound, what a glorious composition, smoothly flowing in the insides of your head, tuning your brain to enjoy. Oh how could they, only one of the voice actors rose to fame, for all of them clearly deserve it. Such a waste. 
 
I have watched Legend of Duo numerous times, and still I find new nuances in it every time I watch it. Marvelous. 
 
It is one's duty to watch this piece of masters, and it only takes one hour. Not like it matters, because the immersion is so deep, you won't even notice it. 
 
Legend of Duo is love, Legend of Duo is life.

    Welcome To The NHK is another one of those hard hitting reality series where you are put in the same situation as the main protagonist, which means you'll be riding shotgun through the whole story. The aspects of this anime are as the following: there is plenty of questions on conspiracies, being a shut-in is bad for you, and that drama is part of everybody's lives. 
Now I enjoyed the series for those ""I can't bare to watch moments,"" because this anime is chalk full of them and will have you rolling! The plot in here is also well developed and really envelops you, making the situation seem so realistic (until you see one of Satou's crazy hallucinations). 
 
In conclusion I give this anime between 8-8.5/10. This is an anime for those who are looking for humor and/or drama.

    Such a crazy work there is it to be here. Disturbing, haunting, chaotic, terrifying - There's not much word that can fathom the disturbing level that this work could produced. Nothing much to say really, but this is just, too disturbing. I would not want to watch this for the 2nd nor the thrice, because that would driven yourself to the edge of a breakdown.  
 
This work isn't just about gore and mutilation, as there is something else need to be told by the director. It's telling about the reality, used to happened life issues in the past. This anime, no , this piece of hellish nightmare are engrossing and deep, furthermore dwelling are in unimaginable twisting road. Lest alone, you would not feel a hint of happiness by watching this, unless you are a psychopath yourself. It's a 50 minutes ride to a path that you would not possibly deemed ever existed before. When the image within this anime spark within my mind, it would not do me any good but to quickly forsaken of it instantly and I'm sure as hell would not be touching this thing again. I kept it though, because very rarely you could see the imaginary of a small part of hell itself.  
 
In the extra section contained an interview against the creator, and he aforementioned that he would want to showed this to the largest amount of audience as possible. I'm sorry but, I do not condone of your will. This thing would never be able to showcased itself in any cinema in the future now, but I do know that you shouldn't showed this thing to anyone that couldn't bear watching material such as this as they would go insane. I'd admired the creator's work, as he took a lot of effort to do this but, it is just not for the mass public. When one looked upon the ending at any rate, it's sure will tarnished tonnes of humanity.  
 
This work received a twisting 10/10 from me. I do not found it to be enjoyable, and rather thinking that it is to become way over disturbing that I would not dare to forgotten of many part of it that easily and it managed to make me felt so ill. 
 
Congratulation, Hiroshi Harada-san. You just scored another frightened audience.

    I was torn at first about this anime. The were two ways of looking at it. Either these twelve episodes are all there is and we aint gonna get anymore. Or hold out hope that it follows AoT & DMW in the new fall season. That's why I chose the former and settled on a four. It's good but not great. It's pretty cool because you see the Shiro and Sora use their wits to defeat their enemies as opposed to their hidden power. It's funny but most of the humour relies on perverted sight gags, and that's okay, because of the characters themselves. they feel honest and natural; in their relating to their new world. The same can be said for the supporting characters interacting with Shiro and Sora. There are only two problems I wish to report about this anime. One is fan service. If you're the kind of person who loathes fan service, may be you should skip this one. Now the second one is in the spoiler below because I don't want to understate how much I enjoyed this series. It has a plot that grabs you and pulls you in. And it just demands a second season! But... 
 
The problem is by episode seven I understood that Shiro an Sora got this. That there's no obstacle they will not overcome. Sometimes it's about the journey and not the destination. Not for me, not with this anime. Knowing they will win makes it no better than any other shonen style anime

    After the outstanding first season, studio Bones returns with a masterpiece, one that you would not want to miss. 
 
Our protagonist Mob starts building his character, facing one case after another, unleashing his power, showing us how much potential he has and allowing us to enjoy the great animation of studio Bones. 
 
One thing I really like about the show is the way Reigen deceives Mob. But in this season, he became more 'kind' to Mob as he began to take into consideration Mob's feeling, which helps us understand how Mob really feels. 
 
While some people consider this anime as a normal one based on the weird animation and the cartoon-like art, I believe it's a masterpiece. The art and the animation go well with each other. Not to mention the outstanding opening that puts you in the mood for a great experience. 
 
One last thing I want to mention is how unique the story is. Today, all we see is robot fights animes, going into another world animes, harem animes etc... These animes are not necessarily bad but they are just not unique, if we watch enough of them we can see a pattern. But Mob psycho 100 is full of now concepts: a middle school student with great powers attempts to face problems that question his way of living and the way he sees ghosts and superpowers. 
 
To sum up, Mob psycho 100 is a fascinating show that never ceased to amaze me.

    Kuroshitsuji II is unfortunate - the best way to describe it. Stellar animation and sound can't make up for the poor plot line and bad characters. I won't address this as a sequel to the first season, but as it's own because I still want to make this fair.  
 
Unfortunately, it falls very flat for me. Much like the second half of the first season, the second season features no manga material, but putting that aside, it lacks everywhere. We're introduced to a new demon/master pair, Alois Trancy, and Claude Faustus. Immediately, we see Alois has had a not so great past featuring some pedophilia, which could have set him up to be a good, fleshed out character, but his cruelness and selfishness outshine what sympathy I could have had for him as a viewer.  
 
Unlike its predecessor, the second season features much more violence and blood, not that the first didn't have any, but it's different in its usage.  
 
A rivalry is set up between Ciel and Sebastian (the returning master/butler duo) and Alois and Claude, for a very poor reason and tries to escape the inevitable end of the series (i.e Ciel's death at the hands of Sebastian) by using a cheap fanservice tactic that could be read in a bad fanfiction.  
 
The storyline is just sad - and not in the way it intends to be. The writing fell flat where it should have and the entire storyline feels ridiculous in the latter half and drags out too long. It's twelve episodes but each episode feels like a drag to get through. There was no comic relief in this season at all, making it a depressing, disturbing and sad anime. 
 
When I say disturbing, I mean a scantily clad fourteen-year-old teasing and making sexual advances on his butler. The entire thing just feels like such ill taste, considering the past this character has seen.  
 
Overrall, as Kuroshitsuji fan, I won't be going back to this season. If you like darker anime then you might like this season, but if you're looking for a sequel with the feel and atmosphere of Kuroshitsuji, I'd say give this one a pass.

    When I first read the synopsis of this anime me and my friend thought it was a joke and so would be a fan serviced filled anime with mindless amounts of ecchi scenes, personally I am not a big fan of ecchi anime being more of a shojo/josei anime viewer myself. Anyway I decided to watch this anime as a joke, just to see how bad it really was but to my surprise it was very entertaining to watch (Because it was really funny ) despite the story being average at best and the music completely unmemorable. This anime is usually either a hit and miss, but for a less mature audience it is probably going to be a very very entertaining watch. 
 
Story: 6 
At first the synopsis may put you off completely from watching B Gata H Kei, after all it does seem completely absurd (as the character wants to have sex with 100 men ._.)  and so it may be dismissed as something only an ecchi enthusiast would watch. In terms of story, the story is quite simple and at times cliche and downright banal. Pretty much it is about Yamada (the main character) trying to have sex with the male lead Kosuda and how she goes about trying to achieve it, it is unique in the sense that it is told from the perspective of a girl (who is planning on being promiscuous and has sexual thoughts running through her mind all the time). Nevertheless the story fails in some respects as it tends to be cliche due to the fact they are constantly interrupted just as they are about to kiss etc etc and that both leads are indecisive which can be frustrating to some viewers, but this is made up for due to the fact the series is very very funny. 
 
Art: 7 
Not much to say about the art, it's decent and I don't think it will put anyone off the anime. One complaint I have is that Yamada is called the best looking girl in her school but she doesn't really look that good (this is subjective though) 
 
Sound: 7 
The soundtrack is not memorable to say the least. But the one thing I did like was the Opening music, the opening music is just your typical high pitched girl singing but I still found it quite cute and catchy to listen to. As far as voice acting goes, there was nothing memorable about it, but they did a fine job. 
 
Character: 8 
I give this an 8 because I think Yamada is a  good character, this is mainly due to the fact that she is the star of the show and she's the one who makes the show what it is. She makes the show entertaining as it is often her actions and words which cause the viewer to laugh, which is, in my opinion, what the show is mostly about - Comedy. Other than Yamada though the anime suffers from a weak and unmemorable supporting cast as the attention is usually focused on Yamada. At times one maybe be able to empathize with the male lead Kosuda as his thoughts do have some semblance to what teenaged males would think but due to the fact that he is the ""Average Guy""  he is mostly unmemorable too. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Now this is the section I'll give a 10 in. As I said before B Gata H Kei is a hit and miss, and it purely depends if you enjoy it right? The thing that makes B Gata H Kei what it is (which is entertaining) is the humor that is employed throughout the series - I showed my friend this anime and he was cracking up the whole time throughout the whole series. The anime is a hit and miss is because the comedy that is employed is more of a Dumb kind of funny rather than the Smart funny many people may be used to and so they tend to shun it as most of the times the jokes made are sex jokes and sleazy jokes and what not. Smarter people may not enjoy this series as much due to this, and indeed there are many people like that, so this series may not be for everyone in that respect. But personally I found B Gata H Kei a very fun anime to watch because of it's humor and the main lead Yamada and every episode I was left craving for more, I still wish there was a second season. 
 
Anyway I still feel guilty for liking this anime as me and my friend took it as a joke at first, but I'm glad I watched it. For all those people like me who only watch one genre (for me it's josei and shojo romance) I recommend you to take a break and try something new for once, or for anyone looking for laughs and a good time watch B Gata H Kei, I highly recommend it.

    There was a thread here recently about people new to anime being too eager to give out 10s. 
 
That would be me. 
 
One poster suggested that one day, those people would find an anime so good they are forced to revise their previous opinions to fit their new definition of what deserves a 10. 
 
That would be Steins;Gate. 
 
Just a little backstory: I recently took a family trip to New York, decided I'd put a few episodes of different series with me to watch on the plane trips over and back; all of FLCL, a few episodes of Madoka, that sort of thing. Steins;Gate was a late addition to this list, the last in fact. I had about three episodes with me to get a taster, then just before I left, on a whim, I deleted pretty much all the music on my iPod and threw the entire series on there. I love my little whims. 
 
I still don't know exactly why I did it, this series takes the whole ""Watch the first three episodes"" advice and throws it out the window, there is nothing particularly spectacular about the opening three. I remember reading somewhere that the plot gets ""really intense around episode 11"", and while I don't remember exactly what happens in episode 11, it was around that point that the show stepped into its stride. Yet there's something desperately compelling about Steins;Gate, even from its very beginning, I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it's the brilliant characterisation and interaction, but whatever it is, it's there. 
 
Animation: 
 
While I'm not exactly drawing from a massive reference pool here, I can safely say that Steins;Gate has some of the best animation I've ever seen, second only to what I've watched of Guilty Crown in this regard. It's crisp, clear and neat. The look of some of the characters takes a bit of getting used to, Mayuri for one, but there's really no complaint that can be made here. 
 
Sound: 
 
Firstly, I have to declare my love of the opening theme, even after 24 episodes of it, I sometimes found myself going back again and again to listen over and over. Other than that, I can't say I really noticed the music at many points. I appreciate this actually, it never tried to steal the show, but instead just contributed to the atmosphere of the show. 
 
Story: 
 
Starts out fairly simple really, a few guys and gals make a machine that can send text messages to the past, and the story follows the consequences and potential of this, by and large. However, as usual, where time travel is involved, the plot will inevitable convolute (Is that a word?), and it does so in a delightfully interesting fashion. There's no waste or filler episodes, the entire series is one big arc, and all ends are tied up nicely. Once it gets going, Steins;Gate progresses at a nice pace, it never feels rushed or sags, so I can't really complain in any way about the pacing. It takes certain situations, and leads them in a way that makes you predict the conclusion, then takes a radical twist at the last second. It's a fantastic way of keeping the viewers' attention, and I'm raving like a fangirl now. The show does get almost episodic  in the late teen episodes as it focuses on certain characters, but it never loses sight of the final post. 
 
All I'll say is that the last two episodes are odd, and nearly out of place. Other than a surprise cameo at the very end, the last few minutes of episode 22 would make for a typical ending, but I'm glad they opted to bring the sort of end they did. 
 
Character: 
 
This is where the show truly shines, and elevates itself head and shoulders above pretty much every show I've ever seen. Every character here could get a story by themselves, but it's the way we experience the snippets of each that we do that truly makes us sympathise with Okabe, one of the most ""normal"", but ultimately compelling main characters I know. 
 
Overall: 
 
I had five hours left on the plane home, five hours left and more than one unwatched series, all of I'd been so eager to watch before I left. But I just couldn't. The program that I thought was so overrated six episodes in affected me to the point where I couldn't do anything other than sit back and digest it for the rest of the journey. Once I got home, my mean score was cut by a full point as I had to adjust my list to the new standard. So I don't really think it's necessary to end this review with any more waxing lyrical, instead, I'd like to give a message, to all the anime makers of the world: The bar's been set baby! Come and wow me.

    A typical reverse harem anime , which I firmly recommend to anyone who enjoyed ""Brothers Conflict"" , ""Diabolik Lovers"" or ""Kamigami no Asobi"". 
 
More specifically: 
 
Story: 
 
The story and the plot were very unclear and difficult to understand. Τhe whole  
incident is not explained and revealed until the very end. 
 
Art & Sound: 
 
Both the artwork and the sound are outstanding. The opening theme of the anime is definitely one my favourite , while the artwork is one of a kind. 
 
Characters : 
 
While  they are really well drawn , the characters lack of a special / distinct characteristic , sth  that will differentiate them from other characters and will make them remarkable. As for the heroine , she is definitely the typical heroine in reverse harem animes , which is really passive , lacks guts , doesn't stand for herself. 
 
Overall , from all the reverse harem anime series I have watched so far this one is my favourite , and I firmly recommend it to anyone who is into that kind of anime.

    i just cant do it i tryed to watch to ep 12 but i just could not get any further. the anime was way to cringy and just plane creapy its a nice idea but the way they went about it was hard to watch i tryed to chear on the main charecter but i found that to hard and i just dont like L to begin with. 
 
light seemed to be just at first but just became some one to hate. any humor throun in there was over shadowed by crazy and just could not enjoy or be remotely happy watching this just depressed.  
 
to be truthfull it problebly should get a 5 but i cant stand it being so high up in the ranks so i put a 1.

    I started watching this show with really high expectations and I'm pleased to announce that I was not disappointed! 
 
""Bakuman"" was created by the same duo who brought us the masterpiece known as ""Death Note"" (Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata) so fans can expect yet another gripping story, but this time with a few more laughs and all-around happy vibes in the mix. It follows the lives of two young boys, Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi, as they start their journey to become the best manga artists Japan (if not the world) has ever seen. 
 
My summary might not do the show any justice, but it's only due to my fear of revealing any spoilers. 
 
Art: (9/10) 
 
The art is amazing and so realistic. Only a slight difference when used for comedic effect (slapstick/ gag) but it's so well executed I doubt anyone would complain. 
 
Sound: (9/10) 
 
I loved all the songs used in the show, except the first OP (way too cheesy in my opinion).  
 
Characters and Story: (10/10) 
 
I fell in love with all the characters as none of them were annoying or boring. Though our leading men stole the show, it just wouldn't be as successful without the supporting cast. The respect and love the characters have for one another really is something to admire, especially how Mashiro and Takagi's ""rivals"" motivate the two to give each project they start their all. 
 
The intensity I felt when watching these 75 episodes made me forget that I was watching an animated show and not some live action drama! 
 
I highly recommend  this show to any fan of the slice of life genre. No, scratch that. I recommend this show to EVERY anime fan out there. If you're looking for a great story with likeable characters, you can't go wrong with this one.

    Every one in awhile an anime comes along that is so game changing, so heart wrenching, and so awesome, that it deserves an absolute perfect score. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) is that anime.  
 
The story itself is one that draws on a number of traditional ideas, such as the young hero who must come to terms with himself in order to accomplish his goals. It is an engrossing and wrenching story that leaves you feeling like you need to demand more, and no matter how badly you would like to change the endings you know that you cannot, because they are perfect the way they are. The story left me breathless, unable to come to terms with the fact that the show I had just watched was over. It is easy to start TTGL and watch the entire show in a single day. The story draws upon all of your human instincts and emotions and centers them into a single show that you cannot take your eyes off of. The story forces you to feel emotions that you had not expected to feel. You come to love the characters and the show because they portray something that is so human while being so absurd that you need to love them. They bring the word ""awesome"" to an entirely different level while connecting to our human instincts on a base level. 
 
The art for TTGL is interesting because, while it uses traditional anime styling, it also has a very original, sketch-artist look to a lot of the scenes. The show has its roots in hip-hop, rock, and folk, and every scene of the show lets you feel what the author wanted you to feel. The sound and art of TTGL draw you in even more to what the characters are doing and how the show is progressing. The show, especially in the later episodes, becomes something that can only be described with the word ""Awesome"", meaning every definition. It's a show that immerses you in itself and refuses to let go.  
 
I would recommend this show to anyone, be they just starting to get into anime or seasoned veterans. Fans of every genre can come to love Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. It is truly an anime worth of 10/10.

    Story: 8 
 
The story is not original: body swapping is something explored in other works. Kokoro Connect and Yamada-kun both come to my mind. However, the plot twists and how plot points were shown early on made it seem as if nothing had been pulled from thin air. The ending was magnificently beautiful and tear inducing. The drawback was how jumpy some transitions were, mainly in the first half of the film. It confused me once or twice and felt off. 
 
Art: 10 
 
The art was incredibly detailed, this being some of the best work I have seen in anime art. Landscapes to character design; all were amazing. 
 
Sound: 10 
 
The music, and its usage, cannot be faulted. The feelings of certain scenes would not be the same without the soundtrack. 
 
Character: 7 
 
Characters are well developed in some instances but not in others. Both protagonists have fully fleshed out personas, as does Mitsuha's friends and family. Taki's life is less explored, the only person truly having character being his co-worker. Ergo, I can only prescribe this category a 7. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
The jumpiness in the first hour annoyed me a bit. Other than that, I loved it. 
 
Overall: 9

    Ah, the controversial Aldnoah.Zero...This really is another one of those love or hate animes depending on how you like or dislike the characters.  Personally, I really enjoyed it and would recommend to any mecha fans who like a huge slice of melodrama and scheming in the same vein as Code Geass.  It aims for an epic, sweeping tragedy where misunderstandings, jealousy, clashing personalities, and revenge drive all the protagonists to push the plot through a spiral of conflict.  It mostly succeeds, although there are a number of issues that prevent this from really being a masterpiece and leave it floundering in ""pretty good"" territory. 
 
[Story] 7/10 - The set-up, inter-planetary war between Earth and Vers (Mars) where Vers have a clear advantage in technology but Earth has..well..luck and pluck maybe?  There's a nice history for the background where there has been a state of ""cold war"" between the two sides but now things have kicked off again.  Earth is prepared this time and the Martians (who are just Earth ex-pats who created a noble caste system on Mars) have lost their previous edge due to infighting and sitting on their arses for decades.  So it is that the war begins anew and provides a scene for our melodrama to unfold.  This, the first cour, begins with a sort of mecha of the week to defeat approach, all to showcase the MC Inaho's incredible tactical savvy.  There are twists along the way and personal dramas of friends lost or imperilled but essentially it is all to build up the development of the lead characters Inaho, Asseylum, and Slaine Troyard.  The plot develops to be about Slaine and Inaho fighting over Asseylum really with the parallel plot of Earth's survival.  Despite the involvement of Gen ""The Butcher"" Urobuchi (writer) early on, it never quite overcomes being a bit over-clever and self-congratulatory in places but occasionally there are moments of epic misunderstanding and Shakespearean-like tragedy that are really satisfying, albeit..well..tragic.  The ending is particularly great, and there is such a payoff of angst and emotion that you cannot help but marvel at how mature the writers were with the plot, despite hiccups along the way.  Pacing is really nice, with action and drama at full tilt with occasional pauses to catch your breath. 
 
[Art] 8/10 - The animation is mostly very good.  Design is solid, with mechs looking awesome and characters pretty well done.  The colour palette is thematic and evocative with Earth scenes having a vibrant blue and green, where the Vers ones more stark or over-saturated with splendid golds and crimsons reflective of their habit of façade.  Animation is mostly very fluid and the mecha fights are nice to watch and a great effort by A1 Pictures.  There are some drops in quality 
 
[Sound] 9/10 - I loved the music from start to finish.  Hiroyuki Sawano is one of my favourite composers for this kind of thing, and his threatening and majestic scores really elevate this anime.  For some they seem a bit repetitive but they create an epic quality that underpins the scenes in Aldnoah.Zero.  As OPs and EDs go, they are all catchy and top notch, however special mention does go to aLIEz because it is brilliant.  The voice acting is also pretty solid and portrays the characters with skill, yes Inaho is a bit flat but that's kinda his thing right? 
 
[Character] 7/10 - You may well love or hate this anime solely based on your appreciation of the main characters.  Firstly, Inaho the MC is emotionally repressed and analytical in the extreme.  He is not without emotion but doesn't show it very much and really only comes to life when he's solving problems, i.e. beating the enemy.  I really liked his understated personality, being mostly calm and quiet except when he's protecting his sis or Asseylum.  He may be deep and thoughtful...calm waters run deep.  Or, you may hate him for the emotionless plot device some see him as.  Slaine Troyard, is by contrast, more emotional and driven by this emotion.  He's also rather illogical at times and self-serving, albeit with good intentions.  Slaine is a great and tragic character, wronged by so many and misunderstood.  He is still a total dick, but a well written total dick.  Asseylum is..well..she's quite disappointing really.  Asseylum is a trope and it's puzzling that these two strong and different characters are fighting over her.  She could have really made this anime amazing if she was more than a peace-loving plot waifu.  I'd have really liked to see her as having drive and agency equal or exceeding the other two.  Supporting characters are all nice, albeit underdeveloped.  They just seem to be spectators for the unfolding tragedy.  Count Saazbaum is a brilliant and layered character though and provides a bit of gristle as a sort of villain.  The other Orbital Knights are mostly pointless. 
 
[Enjoyment] 9/10 - For me, I loved this series.  It was fun and dramatic and I never got bored.  I could forgive it's misfires as the pace took me along for a great roller-coaster ride of feels. 
 
[Overall] 8/10 - Aldnoah.Zero is one of those shows that will always have some fans.  It has great dramatic plot, amazing scenes in places, and emotional pay-off for the viewer.  It does have some WTF moments too, both good and bad, and plot holes you could fly a landing castle through.  However, ultimately I would recommend this to fans of mecha and drama as it's relatively slick and very very well delivered.

    This show is so gripping. You have to wait at least 2 episodes to be really engaged, as the show seems to start off like a slice of life in the first episode and its like, meh could care less about their picnic lol. It's actually quite hard to talk about this show, because its different to most anime I've watched. I don't want to say too much, but I'll say what I can. The show has great characters, and they start off as typical happy characters, its amazing to look back on how they were at the start, to how much they're sanity decreases as certain occurrences start to happen. This show is creepy, I mean it wasn't terrifying, but after the first 4 episodes, I found myself having trouble to sleep at night. Some arcs are creepier than the other, some aren't as creepy but more so unnerving. The music played a big part in me trying not to watch it at night. The soundtrack is quite memorable for its scary themes that play and sometimes they play in not so scary parts, so it puts me on edge. It's doing its job I tell you. Sometimes there were boring, slow parts in the show and conversations that sometimes dragged out a little. It's actually not as ""scary"" as people were saying, I mean yeah at times but its mostly just creepy. I highly recommend watching this series. You can't miss it, you need to watch this.

    Spoilers Warning: That's is if you care. 
 
 
I think I just stumbled across the biggest Anime abomination ever in my life. I mean, Shitcom and No Littering were stupid and hilarious, but Pinky...? To an extent, I'd probably call it one of the most gruesome, disturbing, and graphically dark ONAs that exist. Only reason you should watch this ONA is to probably have a blast (sarcasm) and be purposely disturbed by it. Or of course, just to fill in that completed anime list. 
 
Story is super quick. A guy and a girl have an idea of filming something, so then he starts filming, then she whoops out a chainsaw, and then the person she has that's tied is now getting mauled and chainsawed to death by her with her blood and intestines flying all over the place. Then they finish filming it, and then...Upload it on the internet...Yeah... 
 
Basically this ONA is the embodiment of insanity, twisted idea, and gruesome showing. Nothing much to be honest. This ONA is basically on the same level that you see in Robot Chicken or any other adult swim cartoon you see with it's blood splatting gruesome dark twisted scenes veiled with dark humor. One thing about this ONA is that it makes Goblin Slayer look like a kids show. Only 3 characters exist who have 0 development whatsoever which is intended to be like that, and the basic sound effects, and only some air conditioning sound effect exists, and only 1 quick song plays at the very end of the credits which barely sounds like a song.  
 
Enjoyment? Well, if you like dark humor with sick twisted ideas and a rather disturbing watch. Then I guess this series would be for you. Otherwise, if you value your sanity, then stick to My Hero Academia and Black Clover. If you did watch this ONA already, then try and watch Umaru Chan or any other slice of comedy to cheer your mind up since you probably feel darked out already. Overall, a 1/10 Anime. If there was a 0 for the rating, then I'd probably give a 0/10. As expected lol.

    This is a great anime a must watch if you like an anime with a great subversive plot, countless twists and turns, great characters. Awesome chess analogy through and through and an ending that will leave you not only speechless but wanting more. Only critic is how is a man as scrawny as Susoku that strong.Ohh and the females pilot their nightmares pretty great.

    Seisouhen (Samurai X: Reflection) takes place after the TV show of Rurouni Kenshin, but in the style of Trust and Betrayal. The story is sort of an alternate-ending to the manga, and shows Kenshin struggling to bear his guilt 
 
The art style is very well done, and the animation quality is top-notch. The background art is beautiful.  
 
The music and sound are delicious, especially the music, which is some of the most emotionally satisfying I've ever heard. It is all orchestrated, very well composed. 
 
The main problem in this is the story. The script is quite frankly terrible, and the story suffers from how it is told. It mainly consists of multiple flashbacks highlighting emotional scenes from the anime and manga. However, since fans of the anime and manga won't like the changes, these scenes are left as melodramatic and confusing to the audience that would appreciate this OVA more. There is a certain lack of subtlety to the emotions, and they often come across as forced. 
 
For fans of the TV series and the manga, this is not recommended. The characters are very different than they are depicted in the show and manga, and the storyline is altered. This OVA is more suited for fans of the acclaimed first OVA, Trust and Betrayal.

    I love this anime.  I'm not a particular fan of the prohibition era gangster stories but I really loved this anime.  Don't get turned off by the description... It sounds a little boring for what it actually is in my opinion.  Also the first episode is a bit weird and not entirely necessary for the flow of the show.  Honestly it's more interesting the second time around.  So don't get turned off by the stuff with the Vice President and Carol at the very beginning! They're there to sort of set the ton of the story and the first episode is more used to introduce the characters and the main plot but the real story gets going in episode 2.   
 
Story:  This is a truly original anime.  It takes a story that takes place over three years and mixes it around so that you only get the full picture at the very end.  Another interesting part is that the first episode is what happens at the end of the story.  It follows the events surrounding a group of people who's paths twist together by a series of chance encounters.  The story is a bit twisted, it being about immortals but there is still a solid level of sanity.  There is a lot of blood and murder and people enjoying it... But one of the things I love most is that the main murder actually has a sense of morality to who they chose to kill.  With the story jumping around between the 3 years it get's a bit confusing at times and you really need to pay attention while you watch or you will miss things.  But as you watch things will fall into place and by the end it will all make sense.  You might even have some ""Ohhhhhhh"" moments during the anime; I know I did.   
 
It really can't be stressed enough how important it is to pay attention to everything.  Because every little detail will become important in the total development of the story.   
 
Art: The art is great.  The characters all have their own unique looks that aren't even seen in other animes.  The art gives each of the characters something more than other animes.  The actions is particularly great.  Instead of going in slow motion for parts like some animes do this one almost speeds up.  The characters blur just enough at times to make it more exciting while still letting you see everything that's going on.  It takes place during times when the mafia are big and they do a great job with the setting too.   
 
Music:  The music is so good.  It's big band jazz music that really fits the anime's rhythm.  I loved the anime just by hearing the OP.  I loved how the characters were all introduced with the music.  It's a new thing I havn't seen in other animes that i really liked.  The first time I saw it I predicted which character's I liked based on their short seen during the OP.  The jazzy music always comes in at perfect moments to set the mood and make everything more exciting.  One of my favorite OSTs.   
 
Character: The characters are the best part of this anime, which is saying a lot.  Baccano! has some of the most interesting character I'v seen in an anime yet.  It's a short anime and you don't get a ton of character development but you still get a really good sense of who each of them are.  They're so unique you can't help but remember them.  (Sorry for using ""unique"" so much... it's the only word I can think of to describe its.... uniqueness xD )  The voicing is really good too.  I recognized most of the voices as some of my favorite and fairly popular voice actors but they don't sound the way they usually do so I wasn't stuck thinking ""All I hear is so and so.""  There are a couple of different accents used and the voice actors all do a good job with them.  You really grow to love the characters and you'll find yourself saying things like ""aw... Jacuzzi... :)""  Or giggling just at little things a character says or re-quoting a character right after they say something.   They are all so great I can't really pick a favorite character.  Though i finally did decide on Vino.  Then Firo and Jacuzzi.  If they were in a different anime almost any of them would still be my favorite.   
 
The anime technically ends after 13 episodes but there are 3 OVAs that tie up some unanswered questions that should just be considered part of the show.  I really recommend this anime.  It's a refreshing change from the usual anime styles.

    Thirty minutes ago I wrote a review about Arslan Senki S1 now here I am, back to rant about these idiots. 
 
Originally, I gave this season a 5. Now that I'm looking at it scrupulously, it's more of a 4 or 3. Let me explain. 
 
My expectations are completely different than before. In Arslan Senki, I wanted to be introduced to the characters and their goals, to know more about the setting of the story and also the main conflict. Which was all done relatively well. 
Now for Arslan Senki: Fuujin Ranbu, I wanted to delve into the minds of these characters and see them evolve. Sadly, again, they do not grow. 
 
Our main cast is still the same as before, they do not learn from their mistakes -- they don't make mistake to begin with. Arslan is still an innocent white snowflake without any awareness of the real-life dangers being overprotected by Daryun-oka-chan who's reduced to be the mindless brawl of his 'Highness'. I swear if I hear him yell 'denka' again I destroy the internet.  
But, pals, I had hope! 
When we've met Narsus' old friend, I thought I would finally get the development I've been longing for. Some backstory as to why Narsus is the way he is and how two friends parted on different journeys. Jokes on me, that conflict lasted two episodes with no explanation nor flashback about their relationship to show us how deep the betrayal was.  
And even when Alfreed's brother was introduced, I thought we could see some nice frictions between the siblings or even Alfreed revealing more about her past, anything that would have shown us her struggles or the reasons she ran. Something to make me care, ffs. They can all die, I would literally give no shit because they overlooked that emotional development. I cannot connect with this series because characters aren't real. They're funny and lovable and sure looks good but there is nothing more to them. I'm not as much engaged in the story as I was in Fullmetal Alchemist, for instance. 
Of course, the rest of the bunch is lessened to their previous role with no active participation in the advancement of the plot whatsoever. 
 
Everything in this series is freaking shallow. It's there for sparks and glitters, for cool moments that would make great AMVs. Nothing is deep, the characters are never challenged externally and internally. As a grand poet would say; they have the emotional range of a teaspoon. 
 
The only one that gets a little bit of backstory is our Zuko/Shouto boy. That makes me want to root for the villain, honestly. 
 
The animation found a way to become even worst. I didn't think it was possible but the overuse of dark contrast made it impossible for my screen to distinguish the dark tones from the light tones. The 3D still looks awful but now I'm used to it. Good news is: characters aren't legos anymore! They're freaking carton boxes. Fluidity was lost in favor of better background visuals. I don't know if it's a good thing though. 
I noticed nothing different in the OSTs and despite being sung by the same artists, the OP and ED have less impact than in the first season. 
 
If the eight-episode season didn't tip you off, you can still feel this season was rushed and is nowhere near the quality of the first season. It's not even a whole cour!  
 
There is little chance for a third season, at least not in the close future but I do hope we put all this overdramatic plot aside and focus on the characters. Because Arslan's epic journey is about him, not the super goody fights. I got to care if you want me to root for him or I'll go pray to that Yaldabotthing (bless you, dear) for all of them to die painfully. 
Yeah, I'm a resentful viewer.

    Working!! is a rather simple concept anime series. It is grounded on a set amount of characters and their interaction in and outside the workplace. I honestly thought this was going to be one of those more forgettable series as the premise of people working in one place with little plot development didn’t intrigue me. This series however flipped all my expectations around with its shear simplicity and honesty.  
 
Firstly I would say the characters in this series are unique which gives the series its anchor. The interaction between these characters are very naturally presented that it was a pleasure to watch. All characters in this series are great and well developed from the start thus even with the lack of character development throughout the series it was still enjoyable to watch.  
 
The story is as it is stated in the synopsis and it is just as simple as that. It is just things that revolve around the daily lives of the characters. The art was decent it isn’t significantly great but it isn’t bad either. I honestly don’t have anything to complain about the art as it served its purpose well. 
 
The music for this series was really really good. The opening theme and ending theme fit the show perfectly! It was a real treat to listen to. This is one of the few series where I don’t skip the themes because it is so enjoyable. The instrumental music inside the show was also really good it was well composed and is a great standalone listen. I am very picky about music in general but this series hit all the right notes.  
 
The enjoyment factor of this show for me was very very high. I thoroughly enjoyed watching every single episode and laughing at all those jokes/ slapstick/ impromptu moments. This show was a true enjoyment to watch and I salute the writers and the directors for this aspect as it isn’t easy to pull off a non plot driven show.  
 
This is my first review and I decided to write it as I truly enjoyed this series :)

    I really enjoyed the movie, as it's my first seeing on the big screen. So, it was a bucket list moment, I can't how happy I am because it was a Makoto Shinkai movie based on Rain. (I have some inclination towards Amegekure.) 
 
The plot is decent, with stunning visuals related to the weather which made a good movie altogether. There were some unexpected cameos from our fellow characters in ""Your Name"", they were good moments od remembrance. 
 
In all of the movie, there will be one scene which will be with you forever as she prays at the top of a skyscraper followed by ""fireworks"". Last but not least, an amazing song by Radwimps to finish it off. 
 
I am happy to have lived long to see a Makoto Shinkai movie based on the Rain on the big screen. #OneThingOffTheBucket ^___^

    There are very few ways to describe Nichijou, because as a sketch comedy/slice of life show its very sporadic.  The show is funny, touching, and beautiful.  Its appeal can be divided up into three basic parts. 
 
(1) Humor 
 
There is never a dull moment.  The show uses hyperbole and over-the-top animation to drive home some jokes, and deadpan dullness for others.  It's extremely experimental and a lot of skits are hit or miss.  But luckily, the show is a collection of skits, and if one of the skits happens to be a miss, you only have to wait 1-6 minutes before the show moves on to a completely different skit.  It's fast-paced and funny, which is a great combination because the laughs never stop coming.   
 
(2) Art 
 
The character design is so simplistic that you wouldn't think that this show would get a great deal of praise for is art.  Yet, every frame is near perfection.  The amount of work that went into the animation of the show is visible in a lot of skits.  It's not often you see animation as good as Nichijou's used in a comedy show, especially so often.   
 
And even though the animation is already top-quality, the backgrounds and still shots are equally amazing.  The art is simply beautiful and transitions are done by beautifully drawn images of some background, like an apartment complex, a field with a lake, or an elevator.  Overall, its some of the most beautiful animation/art I've ever seen in an animated show.   
 
(3) Characters 
 
The show is incredibly cute and fun and the characters are unique.  Within the second half of the show, some serious efforts are made to make so semblance of character development, and its actually really touching.  Though the show is primarily a comedy, it is able to touch other emotions as well, and overall is an extremely heartwarming show.  The characters are also extremely cute and fun, making the show just fun to watch overall. 
 
 
 
The rewatch value of Nichijou is infinite.  Since the skits have almost no ties between them, they can be watched in any order and still be hilarious, meaning that any episode can be rewatched at any time for some laughs.   
 
I highly, highly recommend this show.  Normally I feel as though a lot of humor is lost through subtitles because comedic timing is inherently lost, but Nichijou still manages to be downright hilarious.

    I went into Colorful not knowing what to expect. I hadn't watched any previews beforehand, or read any synopsis. The only thing I knew about the film was the front cover, with a boy laying in flowers. Well, the movie that I watched ended up being more interesting than that, but I still feel it has some flaws. Let's discuss. 
 
Story - 6/10 (Concept - 10/10; Setting - 7/10; Structure - 5/10; Pacing - 5/10; Theme - 9/10)  
 
The story has a really interesting setup. A person is revived from what appears to be ""purgatory"" at the beginning of the film. He then has to fill the shoes of a middle-school student who recently committed suicide, all while trying to prove that he's worthy of living in this kid's shoes after what happened to him. 
Things start off well, with the plot being rolled out at a good pace, but after the beginning moments of the film, things start to slow down quite a bit, all the way up to the ending. Each scene feels like it overstays it's welcome just a little bit, making the whole middle of the film feel quite slowly-paced. 
This isn't helped by the poor structure of the film, where things seem to happen without any cause or reason. Throughout the film, there isn't really an arc to the story. There's no consistent buildup to the climax, it's more like a bunch of peaks & valleys between dramatic moments and casual moments, with a bunch of different story threads intersecting one another, and no clear, concise plotline. 
The film ends up redeeming itself by the end by tying all of those various plotlines up into a neat little package, with a good theme as the bow on top. However, despite the film having some interesting moments, getting to the end of it felt like a bit of a chore. 
 
Characters - 8/10 
 
Helping to alleviate some of that slow pacing and messy through-line of the story are the interesting cast of characters. Both the main and supporting cast consists of a bunch of enjoyable characters who are fun to watch on screen, while also having unique and diverse personality traits. There are a few characters who end up having a conflict, and while this is interesting, it also doesn't actually seem to develop them all that much. I thought the characters worked well for the duration of the story, but in the long run aren't very memorable. Still, they work for the moments that they're shown in, and I'd say they're the films second strongest point. 
 
Art - 9/10 (Artstyle - 9/10; Animation - 9/10) 
 
The film's strongest point would be the art. The backgrounds are detailed and gorgeous, and look very realistic. The characters are designed with a lot of realism, but they all still have defining characteristics that make them stand out and easy to tell apart. However, I think the artstyle, while good, isn't my favorite. It works well for the subject matter, but it's lacking a bit of... warmth, I suppose. 
The animation is also really well done, with nicely done, subtle, realistic movement throughout. Characters emote nicely, with various expressions that help to make each scene just a bit more captivating. However, while everything was very solid and clearly done by masterful animators, there weren't any jaw-dropping moments with the animation, it was all very consistent, without any one scene or shot standing out, which I suppose may have been a conscious choice by the director. 
 
Sound - 8/10 (Soundtrack - 9/10; Voice Acting - 8/10)  
 
The soundtrack in the film was fantastic! The songs used in different scenes conveyed the tone of the scene perfectly, while also avoiding sounding like a score and instead sounding more like actual music, which made the soundtrack a lot more noticeable. However, it wasn't noticeable enough to distract me from the dialogue in a scene. 
That dialogue was spoken by a cast of voice actors that definitely breathed some life into the characters, but perhaps not as much as one would hope. I watched the original Japanese dub, and while the important scenes all had really great performances, I felt like there were some moments in-between where the performances fell a little bit flat. Not flat enough to be jarring, but just enough to make those scenes somewhat more boring than the other ones. Some of the lines also sounded like they were recorded with a fan on in the background... and it's very noticeable in quiet scenes where the only thing being heard is a character's voice and they keep muting the dialogue track in-between each spoken line. That was somewhat distracting, but not too big of an issue. 
 
Enjoyment - 7/10 
 
Overall, Colorful is an interesting film with interesting characters and an interesting story. However, it has a few major flaws that keep it from being perfect. The inconsistent structure of the plotline, and the somewhat slow pacing of many of the scenes are both flaws that seem to bring the rest of the elements  of the film down a notch. It's enjoyable, and worth checking out, but I probably wouldn't watch it again. 
 
Overall - 8/10

    Row. Row. Fight the POWA! This anime is one of the best ones I've seen. Compared to some other animes, this one should be at the top. It is very interesting and anyone will just love it. 
 
This anime takes place in a barren world, where humans are forced to live underground. The protagonist, Simon, and his soul brother, Kamina, break the ceiling of their village and reach the surface. A new friend, named Yoko, helps them a lot throughout the adventure. It is very tasteful in some parts, and very funny in others. 
 
The art in this anime is amazing. The artist adds some techniques not seen in any other anime, and it is very effective. The fight scenes in TTGL are very nice, where in the last few episodes, much of the producing money was used for the animating. 
 
The sound is very nice. Some sounds could be tuned up a bit, but overall, it makes the anime awesome. They even put music in the final scenes, and that makes it all the better. The opening and ending songs are very good, and I enjoyed all of them. 
 
The characters are some of the best ones I've ever seen. Simon was developed very well. First, he was very nervous and relied on Kamina. Then, he started to grow up and become braver. At the end, he was out-going and brave like Kamina. He even did some things better. Rossiu started out like Simon, and then he became wiser, except when he did some things that he shouldn't have done :D. Yoko did not develop that much, but she started out very demanding. 
 
I enjoyed this anime a lot. The best part of this anime is the overkill. The giga drill breaker, the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, the sheer size of everything is what makes this anime enjoyable. The size of many attacks are just overpowered, and the size of some bots make everything epic and top of the line. 
 
Overall, this anime is my top anime. I still cannot find an anime better than this one.

    Mekakucity is a pretty nice anime, it starts out very strong in both story and art with intrigue, mystery and a fair bit of hilarity. But as the series continues it flounders a bit for me, it was only in the last few episodes that I found my enjoyment waning, up until then I had really enjoyed it, but looking back I see plenty of flaws. 
The anime is mostly exposition, and while this isn't always bad, while the exposition is done pretty well, I don't feel we've been given the chance to  properly bond with the characters before we're presented with their back story and the back story of the actual story. 
The ending is also pretty... terrible, in my opinion. It feels like it was trying to be epic, to be awesome, but it comes off as rushed, the art seems to degrade especially near the end, and the ending is pretty... hilarious, in a bad way. 
The story was okay, expect the points I've already made, the art was very good at first but got worse later, not too much worse but it wasn't the best, not to sure on the sound as I don't think I've ever heard a bad soundtrack, the characters are decent, some stand out more than others, and aren't given enough attention in my opinion, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. 
Overall a pretty good anime, worth trying at least, just don't expect the world.

    Didnot like this. Probably the only one who ever got recommended this and tried it.  Now there needs to be a review that fell asleep during the show. Am sure after 2 eps. I am not a fan of Aria series. The recommendation came from a top list. Aria the Animation reviews are probably better. 
 
Cats very ugly. Show is all about the slice of life without even comedy thrown in. There are more exciting types of work. Lots a cuteness though. Seems to be the main focus in fact. That and ppl being nice to each other.  And how awesome they are. Infact the slice of life isn't the problem. Nice ppl being nice to each other, being cute, and talking about their cute soft sensitive feelings with all the challenge of walking up a small hill. that is all that ever happens in this show. Any challenge to them seems entirely un-serious. Their support of each other is the same redundant pointless stuff. The psychology of their feelings makes no sense to me. 
 
They love their gondola. The main character is auto awesome. Are those supposed to be guys?

    After almost 12 years, Yasuhiro Nightow's western sci-fi series Trigun blazes back onto the scene with a new adventure about bankrobbers, consequences and another dose of the Humanoid Typhoon. However, is this blast from the past able to keep up with the times? Let's see... 
 
Story: 
The underlining premise of Badlands Rumble is that is right in line with the first episodes of the original series: Wanderer Vash the Stampede brings chaos where ever he goes and even if he isn't the one leveling towns, he tends to cause his share of ""peaceful destruction"". The series' signature goofy comedy and hectic gunfights are back in full force, capturing the wild west feeling while seamlessly blending the sci-fi elements. The overall world of Nightow's series remains intact, with bounty hunters causing trouble, insurance companies working over time and the line between good and bad bleeding through.  
 
What viewers need to address, however, isn't only what they want from the movie, but what the movie wants for itself (if that makes any sense). If you come to this movie expecting a sequel to the manga franchise or a re-imagining of the dated parent animated saga, you may be disappointed. What you will get, however, is Trigun's essence: one man's struggle to uphold his ideas as he works to create the peaceful world he wants. The plot is predictable, yes. The ""twists"" are to be expected, indeed. The path of the story is one that has been tread before, of course. The film doesn't want to rely on its predictable story, though. It's more of a device to introduce you to the characters and the world of Trigun.  
 
Art: 
It's easy to say that Badlands Rumble looks better than its parent story. After all, its been over a decade since the original was animated. However, the quality of animation of B.R is able to also keep up with the best of the current generation. Bullet effects, bar fights, blood pews from foreheads, finger flicks on the noggins, and Vash's needle hair are all rendered with a clean clarity punctuated by vivid colors. The background ambiance of the dusty town on planet Gunsmoke is littered with the crazy designs of all the bounty hunters, having every hair color imaginable and costumes designs that combine technology with grittiness expected from a space western like Trigun.  
 
Character designs keep within the spirit of Trigun, with Vash, Wolfwood and the Bernadelli Insurance girls donning their trademark garbs. Amelia and Gasbag, along with the other more prominent side characters, fit right in with the environment as well. There may have been a few little hiccups of seemingly skipped frames (how did that guy all the way over there end up wrapped up in the tarp over here?), but on a visual basis, B.R is the modern improvement Trigun desperately needed to fight on even ground with most of the other modern animation masterpieces. 
 
Sound: 
One department that the original did not lack in was sound and B.R keeps pace with its predecessor for the most part. Johnny Young Bosch returns to his role as Vash, his cheery voice completing the image of the character for many of the series' fans. The other voices of Wolfwood, Meryl and Milly aren't around for the ride, but their replacements are still great and in some cases actually better than their originals. The OST of B.R is expertly used to back-up scenes, giving emphasis on words and actions with the right mix of western and other influences. Even the reworked version of H.T, Trigun's old OP, was a welcome addition.  
 
Characters: 
The movie does what a lot of movie side stories do: they put pre-made characters in unique situations and don't change them too much. After all, if you have movie that doesn't quite fit in with the canon of the original work, changing the characters too much could step on some toes. That being said, the character relationships are well built as Wolfwood and Vash bicker like an old married couple while Milly and Meryl just try to survive the madness and keep it from getting any worse, only to have comedy ensue.  
 
Okay, so you know the original cast is fine, but what about everyone else? Well, the side characters, like Gasbag's three stooges, as well as the other bounty hunters, are more comic relief than anything, but the main baddie, Gasbag, can pull his weight. His character is, at its core, one of a violent hedonist. He pulls heists in Michael Bay- ways, always keeping his victims afraid of what he'll do next. Like many modern day villains, he's just an excuse to see the hero shine, but his fights and interactions with Vash are at least entertaining. Amelia is a standard character with a predictable attachment to the antagonist, a love-hate relationship with Vash and a brief but humorous contract with Wolfwood. She sees the fault in her ways near the end and reacts accordingly. Perhaps her one truly unique characteristic is her early allergic reaction to men, which is sad. However, she is not a waste of space. Her past fills out her role in the story so even though she doesn't make the movie one of a kind, she, along with the rest of the characters, don't drag the movie down either.  
 
Enjoyment: 
As a pretty good fan of Trigun, I had read about this show before watching it, so I knew that this wasn't going to be a movie that would significantly change how I see the series. It did, however, reinforce my idea that Trigun can accomplish both humor, action and sentiment all at once. The show's story, while predictable and heavily reliant on the characters, is one that matches with the tones of the series. The art and sound can easily keep with the best of this generation, while the world and character designs bring back Trigun's unqiue flavor to the anime battleground. The original cast stays true to form, combining the comedy and the action in  ways only they can do, while the new gang does their jobs as plot devices and additional comic relief pretty well.  
 
On its own, Trigun: Badlands Rumble is a nice popcorn flick with a humane touch. Taken with the series, it turns into a nice excuse to bring the gang back together and maybe even gauge interest in a ""Brotherhood-esque"" re-imagining of the series. Since its been about 4 years since the movie came out, its probably not going to happen, but its still a good bit of fanservice none the less.  
 
The grade for this movie is a ""meaty 7"", as it's a good show in its own right. Fans of the show should at least give it a try, while newcomers can get a modern taste of the franchise before deciding if they want to give it a shot. You won't lose anything if you don't watch the show, but you have a chance to gain something if you do.

    The epic conclusion to a beloved story. Told across 2 manga series, with a total of 4 anime seasons. It has one of the largest casts, each with their own motivations and roles to play throughout the story, and each of them has their own character development arcs. It is a grand story, one that gives you the sense that there is so much going on in the background, that will all somehow interconnect with each other in the end. The romance is desirable, and the action sequences are next level. Overall, it is one of the greater series out there, which I think everyone should atleast give it a try. 
 
The story I just described however, is not Tokyo Ghould:re's anime adaptation. 
 
This anime, is the most disappointing anime of 2018. I beg you to refrain from watching this, and instead read the manga, or else your opinion of the series as a whole may be forever destroyed. 
 
I truly pity the anime-only's, because you guys are probably so confused with what's going on, or will be. Because, they don't explain anything. I'm honestly not surprised, since they took over 100 chapters of the manga, and squeezed it into 12 episodes. Some of the new characters you don't even get to know! They just have their names called out to by other characters, and that's the only way you can identify them. Like, who the hell thought that it was a good idea to do this?! 
 
In short, the story is so convoluted and awkwardly told that you end up not even caring anymore about what's happening. 
 
The art is low tier, and the animation is clunky. It just looks bad, because of how they animated it using such a small budget, I would assume. 
 
The sound is the only redeeming quality of the show. The OP and ED are pretty nice, even if they can't compare to the first season of Tokyo Ghoul. The V.A.'s weren't bad, but some of the sound effects sounded a little off. Not enough to bother you honestly. 
 
As I previously stated, the characters are all just thrown down the dump. Anime-only's will never get to know them, or even care about any of them. Plus, this might be nitpicking but, they completely messed up Touka's hair color. She intentionally dyed it a light blue, which you can see from the manga cover, yet they didn't change that here in the anime. Atleast get the character design right, if you're just going to completely ignore everything else! Furuta's character however, was done rather well. I enjoyed his antics, even if they were messed up. 
 
I'm still mad about not getting to see Hsiao animated, or even introduced properly. Atleast the gigantic oppai's would have slightly redeemed the show.... xD 
 
The action scenes were the worst. You can't even tell what's going on most of the time, not that you'd care about it by the time you got there. Now, I'm not saying every episode is bad. There were some good ones, but the majority far outweighs the minority. 
 
I did enjoy seeing the conclusion of Kaneki's struggles, but I just wished that the journey leading up to that could have been done better. Give it better animation and more time. Get the character design's right, and stop jumping from place to place in the story as if you're doing a flashback sequence for the entire season. Then maybe, just maybe, Tokyo Ghoul:re would have been a good anime adaptation. 
 
Thank you for reading this review! I hope you have a wonderful day, wherever you are!

    Story (27/30): 
 
The first thing that sets Made in Abyss apart from the rest, is its story and world building. It is a rare true adventure story, where the plot advances through individual interactions between the characters and the environment, instead of some overarching ambition or goal. This makes the plot very unpredictable -- unlike, say, a tournament arc commonly seen in shonen type stories, where it’s more about how rather than if the protagonist will win, surprises lurk around every corner in Made in Abyss, and things could turn ugly at the whim of the author.  
 
The general story is in three arcs, with a couple of standalone episodes in between. The first arc is an exemplary introduction into a fictional world, and the third arc has an impactful and emotional story. Comparatively, the second arc falls rather flat -- it’s still above average, but with the bar set so high by the first and the third, it’s hard not to feel that the second arc is somewhat weak in storytelling and slow in pace. That said, the third arc, especially the 47 minute long final episode, was so amazing for me that I’m willing to overlook the shortcomings of the middle section.  
 
But the real problem lies in the fact that with only 13 (technically 14) episodes, the story is nowhere near complete. From a broader perspective, it feels like just the prologue to a grand story. If we get stories as amazing as the third arc in the upcoming seasons (and there’s every indication that’s the case), this anime could very well achieve legendary status. But as it is, the journey has just began, and there are more questions about the world and the characters than answers. For that, I must deduct some score from the story. 
 
Made in Abyss managed to build some very memorable characters despite not giving them a lot of screen time, but due to the nature of the plot device (the Abyss), our protagonists are required to leave everyone behind as they travel forward. This leaves very little room for other characters to develop, and often feel like they only exist in service of moving the plot forward. The departure scenes do carry more weight as a result of the inability to backtrack, but it also comes with the knowledge that we’re very likely never going to meet any of the characters again. The end credits managed to remedy this to a small degree (which is no small feat), but you can’t help but hope they could be developed further. 
 
Visuals (18/20): 
 
The visual aspects of Made in Abyss are simply gorgeous. From the picturesque backgrounds, to the smoke and fog effects, to the smooth animation of fight scenes, everything is wondrously drawn. If I were to nitpick, however, the main characters (Reg in particular) isn’t drawn particularly consistent throughout the series, with his head shape morphing many times, often quite visibly. I personally have no problem with the chibi artstyle, but it does somewhat amplify these small discrepancies. 
 
The one thing I can’t get over with, is how some of the monsters in the abyss are being represented. From what I understand later, the blurry, low definition design of certain monsters appear to be a deliberate design choice, but compared to the clear lines of other monsters and the anime as a whole, they look out of place and cheap. A minor score deduction from an otherwise beautiful anime. 
 
Sound (20/20) 
 
Even above the great visuals, is an absolutely amazing OST, and one I did not hesitate to purchase. Kevin Penkins did a stellar job composing a highly varied collection of tracks that are at the same time fantastical yet foreign, and it’s apparent that there had been a very close relationship between him and the production team to produce a soundtrack that fits some scenes extraordinarily well.  
 
The show also does not hesitate in bringing the music to the foreground when necessary, and let the music drive the scenes and emotions. It is an integral part of why the first, tenth and final episode were as amazing as they were, rather than just an icing on the cake. The show also boasts some amazing sound effects and VA that further presents the care put into the effort. 
 
The OP and ED, while being catching tunes in their own right, pale in comparison to the OST. I’d even consider them detrimental to the overall soundscape established by the show itself. This is one of the rare cases where I skip the OP not because it’s uninspired, but in fear of ruining the viewing experience. 
 
Enjoyment (30/30) 
 
It’s rare to come by an anime that delivers on all fronts, and it’s all the more welcoming in a comparatively boring season. This is one anime that probably works better binge watching, as the slower pace of the middle episodes become less of a problem.  
 
Some have commented on the sexualize representation of children, but I personally see none of it in the anime, save for one gag in episode 2 that might have gone a tad too far. Otherwise penis jokes don’t bother me, and I find no other scene that is disturbing, or can be considered “sexual” in nature. The reactions of the children are in line with prepubescents who have just begun to explore what sex is, and there are no sexual/love interest relations with any adults. 
 
It is one rollercoaster ride of emotions that will be remembered for a long time. Certainly the highest enjoyment to be had in years. Now if only we had a season 2...

    This is super biased, but I've been watching anime for awhile now thinking that its a good time sink. 
 
Now, I've been going through a tough time recently in life, and as the shut-in weeb I am, I have resorted to watching anime to cope with my hardships. Although I found the story to be quite slow in the first few episodes, after a rough start I believe it was fully worth the build up to what it currently is. Watching this anime just does some things to you.  
 
As I struggle to find purpose in my daily life, I become... enlightened when I watch this anime. It sounds crazy, but almost every episode since the start of the operation has been carefully designed. Each battle represents a small story crafted to overcome their own struggles and go beyond (plus ultra! <3).  
 
Although anime as a whole isn't (and should never be) representative of real life, it's crazy how 20 minutes can flip my mood and make me motivated to carry on in life! I look forward to the episodes to come :)  (even though I've read the manga LOL)

    Date A Live II has been an enjoyable anime for me to watch. This anime doesn't really live up to the high expectations it was given but nonetheless it was still a good anime 
 
Story - It is obviously about Shido trying to save more spirits but I felt like there was a clearer antagonist in the story. The story progressed well in a way but I feel a lot more work should had been put in this anime.   
 
Art - The art is kinda different and I feel it has downgraded a notch. the only one I found with an improvement on this Tobiichi Origami 
 
Sound - It sounded fine. No real complaints on the sound 
 
Character - The characters are great as the first season and you will see a few new characters. 
 
Enjoyment - I enjoyed Date A Live II a lot and I hope they will have a season 3 regardless of having a very low chance of having it, I still enjoyed it a lot. 
 
I know many people are hating on this anime for numerous reasons but give the second season of Date A Live II a shot. It may not live to the same enjoyment as its predecessor but It is a good anime and I hope you watch it.

    First of all, I have to say I am a fan of the manga which this anime was derived from. Overall I think this is a ""okie"" adaptation and I gave it a overall score of 8 out of 10.  
Following this I will give a detailed breakdown of how I feel about the adaptation compared to the manga. 
 
Story: 8 
Story is exactly the same as the manga, only some minor details in the scenes are edited. The story of ""Magi"" is a story of grand adventure using a paraody of the characters and the background setting from the classic ""Tales of the arabian nights"" stories. Most people would be famililar with names such as ""Aladdin and the magic lamp, Ali Baba and the forty thieves, Sinbad and the Tales of the seven seas"" 
 
Magic lamps, spells, flying magic carpets, djinns, deserts, bandits, adventure & danger... all the iconic objects and elements from ""Tales of the arabian nights"" make it into the story of ""Magi"".  
My only gripe with this anime adaptation was that the emotional parts of the story from the manga does not have the same weight as they do in the anime. It could be due the fast pacing of the anime episodes.  
The drama and emotional, dark, gritty background stories on each the characters was part of what made the plot of manga ""Magi"" so attractive. The characters are flawed and almost everyone has a bit of dark history, the history makes the actions of each character believable and the reader/viewer can relate and understand the motivations of each character. 
However in the anime the scenes which deplict their histories seem to be rushed and this reduces the overall weight and effect of the emotional drama. 
 
Art: 8 
Bright colours in the anime are really well done and the characters are animated almost exactly as they were in the manga, in a bit of a childish, immature way. The colours really bring out the beauty of ancient arabian culture as if you would want to see them if you could travel back into time.  
The childish character animations bring out part of the comedy aspect, the anime doesn't take itself too seriously, and this gives the viewer a nostalgic feeling of adventure & discovery that they had when they were less than 10 years old. 
 
Sound: 9 
The voice actors for each of the characters fit the characters perfectly, except maybe for Aladdin. A voice actor with a more childish voice might have been a better match for Aladdin, but overall the current voice actor does a decent job. 
The opening and especially the ending song really brings out the childlike sense of adventure that is invoked when a person gets involved watching ""Magi"".  
Just listening to the childish voices singing the chorus of the ending song, watching scenes of Aladdin and gang travelling, being wowed visiting the different cultures all across the land, gives the viewer the feeling of grand adventure, innocent wide eyed amazement at discovering new cultures and seeing new lands. This bundle of positive feelings is really a good summary of what a viewer feels when watching ""Magi"" :) 
 
Characters: 8 
Like I mentioned in the story review section, the characters are well thought out. Each character has a distinct personality, flaws and elaborate backstory with a little bit of darkness splashed in. This makes the characters believable, the motivations sound, and the audience can understand, relate and connect to the characters.  
I only wished the anime could spend a little more time and effort and add more weight to the dark backstory sections (as compared to the manga). A first time anime viewer of ""Magi"" compared to the manga reader would probably not be as invested in the characters. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
Pretty enjoyable anime overall as it conveys the beauty and sense of adventure from the manga version of ""Magi"" very well. So far whenever a new anime episode is subbed and released each week I have been eagerly watching and anticipating how the story from the manga is going to be adapted into anime. 
 
Overall: 8 
A decent anime adaption of ""Magi"" from manga to anime. The songs, voice acting are almost a perfect fit for the characters. The anime remains very faithful to the story and filler free (thank goodness!). My only gripe is that they seem to breeze through the story at a pretty fast pace and don't spend enough time elaborating on the darker backstory sections of the characters. I would actually recommend reading the manga over watching the anime. And if a person wants to do both, read the manga first before watching the anime, enjoy!

    Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai, The World God Only Knows, is an anime that centers on an otaku gamer's life. When I first found this series, I researched on it a bit on Wikipedia, found it somewhat unimpressive in plot, character and art, and didn't even bother reading the manga. I have to say that I was wrong to judge this series by merely the front cover of its Wikipedia article. After the anime came out and my anime savvy friend directly recommended this to me, I found that I was drawn into the story, something that rarely happens for an ardent critic like me. This anime aims to set a standard for humor and adventure, and I believe that it achieves both. 
 
Art (9/10) 
The art is great. Although I've seen better and more creatively drawn animes, with regard to the context of this anime, the art is drawn very appropriately. For example, during the comedy scenes, the art is drawn chibi but with some elements that further resonates the humor, whether it be a small action or item in the background. The art never hinders your enjoyment of this anime and even improves the experiences with elegantly drawn characters like Elsie.  
 
Story (9/10) 
The World God Only Knows is about the life of a 2-D ""Game God"" Keima. He is known throughout the web as the conqueror of all visual novel, bishoujo games. One day he unknowingly signs a contract with the devil, mistakenly taking the contract as a challenge to his Otaku God position, to help a demon girl Elsie collect escaped souls from hell that hide within the empty space in girls' hearts. Should he not comply with the contract, both he and Elsie will lose their heads. Literally.To exorcist the evil soul, he must make the girl fall in love with him and kiss him. The only problem is that everyone in real life calls him an otaku and avoids him for his addiction to 2-D girls and games. This story incorporates comedy right into the base and still embodies an objective to be achieved throughout the course of the series... all while giving the viewers some LOLs in the process.   
 
Sound (8/10) 
Although I do not usually comment on the sounds, I did notice that certain things were outstanding. This anime does not have a particularly ""addictive"" opening and ending theme, but it has creativeness that far surpasses some addictive-themed animes. In episode 4, there is an extra opening and ending that really personifies the storyline and shows diligent planning that went along with it. This ability to creatively adapt to the content of each episode with compatible musical compositions  is what really separates this anime from others and also earns the music producers some well-deserved kudos. 
 
Characters (10/10) 
The characters in this anime are exemplary. Keima, especially, was someone who really stood out from the mundane, long list of modern anime characters. Although he doesn't embody the cold, taciturn personality that I usually look for in male protagonists, he is clearly distant from the level of backboneless ""male"" (sometimes I really do question their gender) protagonists that get beat around by the females. What I like most about Keima is that he establishes his ideals and is determined to do what he believes in. He overcomes many embarrassments and obstacles and always seems to plan for the worst (I hope some people in real life would learn that). Other times his dedicated assertions, like ""Life is just a crappy video game"" and ""Real life girls suck. 2-D girls are better"", were really similar to mine and gave me some lulz. As someone who likes to relate to male protagonists, I really felt that I could connect with Keima and understand his ideals - part of the reason why this anime drew my attention. Elsie, the pretty female protagonist, was also a very likable character. She embodies the ""kawaaiii"" personally and really tries her best to help Keima (despite the fact that some efforts have opposite effects). She is never arrogant or unpleasant and always tries to care for Keima to act like his ""little sister"" (although there definitely are some love feelings between them).  
 
Overall (9/10) 
The World God Only Knows is a great anime overall. It combines humor and adventure successfully into a masterpiece that many previous animes have tried and failed to attain. For someone who had such cynical and critical attitudes before watching, it took only 10 minutes of the first episode to turn me and my ideals 180 degrees into zealous enjoyment. If you're looking for a funny anime that still has a good story played out by likable characters, The World God Only Knows is definitely an anime that you should put on your list.

    How far are you willing to go just to be lazy?  Would you write your name in braille just to avoid more pencil strokes?  Are you willing to walk through the rain if it means not putting in the work to hold an umbrella?  Or how about just skipping this anime and just read this review and make your opinion so that you don't have to keep your eyes open for another 4 hours? 
 
Story: What story?  It's only about a guy, Tanaka, who puts everything in his might just to do nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  He's lucky enough to have a friend, Outa, who likes him enough to carry him everywhere if it has a 0.0001% chance of doing something after.  They live their lives facing 12 episodes of cliche settings and scenarios.  The main thing that makes this anime more than worth a watch is the comedy for it is consistent, amusing, and some episodes are downright hilarious.  Most of the comedy that I found funny were Tanaka's explanations on to how far he is willing to go if it just means doing nothing.  The show was very relaxing and gave me a good laugh in the morning every weekend. 
As for my complaints, I would say episodes 1-9 were consistently ROFL funny but 10-11 were actually not all that interesting.  Tanaka began to be less funny because he was just being lazy instead of speaking his mind as to why he doesn't want to put in effort (which was where the comedy truly excelled in the show).  This factor will be different for every viewer.  Some might still like it all thorughout and some might get tired of it and feel that the comedy is waning earlier. 
 
Characters: The characters are definitely the strong core that holds the show together.  If you will be producing an episodic show, the characters matter much more than the scenario of each episode and Tanaka-kun wa Itsudemo Kedaruge without a doubt succeeded at that.  Tanaka is the lazy boy in class who always makes the viewers laugh as much as he's trying not to be funny.  Outa is the best friend who's amount of concern for people does not match his delinquent looks (seen it before but it still works).  Shiraishi was a stand out character who had a lot of funny moments but also added some depth to a few episodes for how she transformed from a dorky girl to the most respected student in class.  Echizen was a likeable tsundere who put on a tough girl act but had a soft spot for cute things such as another character Miyano.  The last character I will mention is Rino, Tanaka's imouto (cuz otoutotachi are uncool).  She is the kuudere of the series but she very cares for Tanaka and had a somewhat distant yet healthy relationship with him.  Plus her hatred for Outa for always stealing her onii-chan away from her was also very comedic.  There are some characters that were forgettable and less interesting but the interesting characters that I mentioned got more focus and carried the series well so I don't have any complaints. 
 
Art/Animation: Animation and art were solid.  But what caught my attention was the design of the high school.  If was more wooden than plaster and it made for a unique-looking setting and was refreshing. 
 
Sound: The score was not very apparent mainly because it was quiet all the times to fit the tone of the anime.  But the opening was very calming and I never felt like skipping it. 
 
Final Verdict: Tanaka-kun is one of those anime that didn't aspire to be a lot but it mainly succeeded in what it wanted to be so I give this anime a lot of respect.  If you are down for slow and somewhat relaxing slice of life anime and you are in the mood for a laugh, then you should definitely give this a check-out.  This was the hidden gem of the season and I'm relieved to have found an anime that shows people that slice of life is one of anime's strongest genres when you find the right one.  I enjoyed this anime beginning to end and end was definitely satisfying.  Tanaka for all the effort you did not put in, I humbly rate this a 7/10.

    Well well well, The last 1.5 hour or so was considered a special but felt like a movie 
 
- Story (8/10): 
In a nutshell, an adventure that Luffy endures while training with Rayleigh, it took place between the 2 years gap, we got to see Luffy fight together with Boa, we had some giggles every now and then which is expected from one piece content, Luffy developed well durry this special, as we see him advancing in controlling his Haki abilities, He still showed a very sensitive spot on his brother's incident tho, but he'll overcome it an upcoming point. 
 
- Art (8/10): 
The typical One piece art, the animation was fluid of course, Luffy's outfit looked so stylish, and the second gear's scenes where animation amazingly. 
 
- Sound (8/10): 
Nothing very remarkable, your very usual meal of One Piece soundtrack, the hype, and emotion remain. 
 
- Characters (8/10): 
Yet another One Piece spin-off, and of course other new characters, referring to the World's pirates here, they stand out for a good villains, World's backstory was convincing enough to build him up to be the way he's now, having to endure that, and being betrayed by your Nakama, spending 30 years in Impel down is no easy task, The guy just wanted revenge which is, of course, typical in those situations. 
 
- Enjoyment (8/10): 
Totally loved what I watched, would I recommend it? Most diffidently, it's such a good watch after you finish the first half of the series. 
 
- Overall (8/10): 
I really enjoyed this movie, the event weren' that rushed, It didn't contradict the main, plot that much, so I'm fine with it. 
 
 
For those who skipped the ending cutscene, go see it, an awesome character 'S' made an appearance, and it was on point too, <3

    Satsugai Satsugai !!  
Alright first of all i need to mention that if you strictly reject Metal music, or have a hard time tolerating dark humor then you might not want to watch this OVA . 
The story is about a young country boy, Negishi that decides to go Tokyo to make the music he's always dreamed of making which is basically romantic/relaxing guitar melodies, but ends up being the Vocalist and lead guitarist of the upcoming death-metal band Detroit Metal City (DMC). This series truly cracked me up, and got me excited with one of the best Opening themes I've ever heard. There's also a lot of awkwardly funny events involving sexual harass, a little bit of nudity and some mosh-pit related over-excitement so to speak :P . Negishi is a shy boy by nature, but as tends to reveal his ""Demon King "" side when he his provoked and that's how the funny scenes unfold . 
The story isn't something amazingly stunning, but it's very funny and i think the music is definitely one of a kind . I'd say it's satisfactory for my humble metal taste at least . 
Finally i want to mention that if you decide to watch this, don't be too serious watching it.  It's extremely awkward, but that's what makes DMC . Also be prepared for ""Rape "" scenes . Don't worry it's not hentai  xD  
 
"" Krauser's ""Ten Rapes a Second"", anyone? "" 
 
\m/ Hope you found this helpful . Have a good day . \m/

    This anime is much better then the first series (naruto)  the story is much more interesting and the fight scenes are much better also.  The fillers do get annoying in Shippuuden but not nearly as annoying as Naruto's fillers did.  Naruto Shippuuden is a typical shounen anime and I don't think that any of them should really get 10 overall.  But Naruto/ and Shippuuden has just a warm and interesting story that you just cant help but love.  One of my all time favorites for sure.

    ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!! 
Yep! One of the most highly anticipated animes this season! And it's about  our Hero Saitama and his journey to become the strongest! 
..... Wait what? It isn't? He's already the strongest? Alright..... 
This show is a deep and emotionally sophisticated show about the world's strongest hero Saitama who is suffering from an identity Crisis! 
....... Wait, no? So it's not like a superman sorta deal? Not even a Goku deal where he was sent there to destroy earth? No? He's human? 
""Well then Shit! What is this show about?"" you may be thinking, or you may be thinking ""Man this asshole is terrible at writing reviews!"" 
Well both of those thoughts are with good reason! One Punch Man is a show about the world's strongest Hero Saitama, he went through 3 years of intense training, so much so that all his hair fell out! And now he's so strong, that no matter who he fights, it always ends in one punch! Now where's the story in such a show? Well it's simple, this show is pretty much taking the piss out of your every day shounen shows, a large sum of the humour in this show comes from the ignorance of other characters, many of which either look down on or underestimate Saitama's power. Now hop on! Welcome to the One Punch Man Hype Train! My name is Cocomapopsified and I'll be your guide! Because you think this is some parody anime? Ohhh it's sooooo much more! 
 
STORY LINE MEADOWS 
If you all look out the left side of the train you will see the Story Line Meadows! The vast plains! They're..... kinda boring, but look at those flowers and those animals! They're.... cute but not doing much...... 
Yep, this is probably the major flaw in this anime, the storyline is kinda predictable. This occurs due to the logical consistency that is the main character. Other animes, you never know if a character stronger than the main character will suddenly show up, but in this, he's already the most powerful, so no matter who he fights, it feels like it's only a matter of time. Saitama's punch for the most part of the show acts as a kind of ""Climax"", like the punchline of a joke (heheh get it? ""Punch""line?). When he throws a punch, it's basically the end, though not to spoil anything, but that's not always the case.  
Saitama fights many strange mysterious beings, creatures from underground, a sexually attractive mosquito, I want to avoid spoilers, but man he fights a lot. These fights by the way, are something beautiful which we will discuss once we pass these meadows! 
 
ART RIVER 
Now if you'll look out the windows again you'll find Art River! The beautifully flowing water and it's bright blue colour makes it delightful to step in, or just to watch it flow! One Punch Man's art/animation is exactly that, sometimes they'll deliberately make the art look cheap and blocky as the Young Jump webcomic does, this refers to the original webcomic written and drawn by the famous ONE, if you read ONE's version, it's strangely engaging, mainly because he writes it so well, sure the art style leaves a lot to be desired, but you can just picture the scenes! It's really a good webcomic, but in regards to ART, the young jump webcomic drawn by the famous Yusuke Murata, whose art is absolutely beautiful, and MadHouse has done everything they can to recreate the compelling story of the original webcomic while maintaining the character designs of Murata's adaptation. The fight scenes, ohhhhhh the fight scenes, you can just feel the money they threw around to animate those scenes, most notably the scenes starring Genos the Cyborg. This isn't bad either because, genos actually exists in this series as the polar opposite of Saitama, a highly dramatic, highly emotional and energetic fighter with an ambition which drives him forward, literally the opposite of Saitama, who has now reached his goal and is rarely excited and is quite often disappointment.  I can't even call talking about the fight scenes spoilers because you'll find that every fight in one punch man has been editted and uploaded to youtube about a million times for each fight. You'll see, and as you'd hope, they've saved the best for last. Now everybody pay close attention! We're about to enter Sound Forest!! 
 
SOUND FOREST!! 
Now everyone, as we pass through these forests, listen carefully, you'll hear the beautiful sound of the now endangered ""Actually awesome OST"" bird, the songs sung by these birds are said to resonate very well with the forests in which they live! And in these forests, hard rock is very welcome! It's not annoying, as it's not around all the time, only when the awesomeness PEAKS! When making this series I think they were well aware of what makes this series so appealing, and hence they decided to make the music quite fitting, something which is designed to maximise the carnage and intensity throughout the arcs right up to Saitama's PUNCH line..... heheh 
The opening, THE HERO!! by the JAM project, whose members all have experience making very nice anime openings, the full list being 
Hironobu Kageyama - Dragon Ball Z “CHA-LA HEAD-CHA-LA” 
Masaaki Endoh - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s “BELIEVE IN NEXUS” 
Hiroshi Kitadani - ONE PIECE “We Are!” 
Masami Okui - Revolutionary Girl Utena “Rondo-revolution” 
Yoshiki Fukuyama - MACROSS 7　“SEVENTH MOON” 
When you have these people performing, you know it's bound to be a roller coaster of a song! This opening is easily the most memorable part of the music, in fact I'm listening to it as I write this review! I don't know how many times I've tried to keep up with the song's intensity when singing then I shut up because I feel like I'm ruining the song for myself. The song, with its over the top bridges and insane chorus, really gets you rearing and excited for the episode, but the opening is so intense and awesome, that you almost forget this is supposed to be a show which makes fun of shounen manga tropes, it in fact, kind of makes those tropes kinda cool again, which is fascinatingly ironic. The ending? Ohhh well, it's nice! Yeah, it's nice, nice and uhh, soothing, kinda relaxing after the intensity of the show, but well, nothing that exceptional. Ohh we've passed through the forest! What's that I see? That's the Character Village! 
 
CHARACTER VILLAGE 
Now the locals around here are an interesting bunch, SPOILERS!! We have PLENTY of mysterious beings! Big ones, small ones, small ones which get bigger! Ones from outer space, ones which die in less than a minute, some which look like a studio Trigger reject, all sorts! The ""Heros"", we have some which are piss weak, some which are pretty strong but nothing compared to the main characters, but the really strong heroes don't really make an impression until the last few episodes when you get to meet most of the S class heroes, who are the ones which can get anything done, because everyone else is kinda just fodder, but thanks to distinctive yet not annoying appearances (lookin' at you One Piece!) it's incredibly easy to remember the characters, so you'll have no worries there. A lot of the characters have been inspired by characters in other animes, which makes sense since this whole series is designed to parody the shounen tropes, except for Saitama, who is a parody of ""Anpanman"" a super hero in a child's anime of the same name in Japan who head is a red bean filled bread (Called""An-pan"" in japanese) often takes his villains out with a single ""An-Punch"" Hence why in japanese One Punch Man is ""Wan-Pan-Man"". But because of how well they pull it off, it kinda makes the tropes awesome again, ironically. But apart from Saitama, don't really expect anything substantial in terms of character development or in depth character design, they're all just there as stereotypes after all, they're not really there to pull our heartstrings, and while for other series that may be a draw back, for this series that's quite a plus in my opinion, forced tragedy in these series is just a waste, especially since the entire makers and ONE himself doesn't take it seriously, I kid you not he only made the first chapter to test a new software, he didn't think it'd become this popular! 
 
DID YOU ENJOY YOUR TRIP?! 
Because I sure as fuck did! If you're looking for something that will move you to tears, then DON'T WATCH IT! Only watch this if you're up for some absolute balls to the walls fun, this series is not a series designed to pull our heartstrings, and it's not designed to be different and intelligent, though some of the philosophies presented throughout the series are rather interesting, so it's not unintelligent, it's just not the central focus of the series. Now, when I rate a series, I like to rate a series based on the intention behind the series and how well they've achieved it, I like a series which knows what it is, and doesn't pretend to be what it's not. Because of this, I'd like to give this show 
10 consecutive normal punches out of 10 
Because it's not the perfect anime, but it's the most entertaining anime I've seen in years!

    Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo started off quite brilliantly and so it’s a shame that the second half couldn’t live up to its first half. 
 
To start off, the one thing that remained absolutely solid throughout the show was the fantastic direction. Scenes transitioned smoothly to the next, everything was set up in a logical manner whereas many romantic comedies seem to go from scene to scene doing whatever’s best to explain the story and I was pleased that Sakurasou didn’t walk down this path. 
 
It was the first half that really kept me interested in Sakurasou. It set up the main cast really well, distinguishing each character and giving them a lot of vigor. The chemistry between all of them was great, especially the love triangle between Sorata, Mashiro and Nanami and it was really nice to see everything unfold. 
 
And so I was quite disappointed when Sakurasou decided to go down the path of being a generic romance. The anime started using elements we’ve seen over and over again. Now using generic elements certainly isn’t a bad thing if it can present it in a way that feel fresh, but Sakurasou failed to do that. The energy it once had in the first half suddenly turned into a slow melodrama. But the ending was by far the most disappointing, as it was sappy and very unresolved. 
 
That being said, that second half isn’t as bad as I make it out to be as there were still a couple of powerful and heartfelt moments. But overall, it was still quite lackluster compared to the first half and mediocre at best. 
 
So overall, starting off with a bang and losing speed at the end, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was still a fairly enjoyable anime to watch and I really wished they could have kept it solid throughout.

    Who are you? 
 
 
   I must admit that I saw this work twice, because at first I did not give it the due importance it deserved, and when I reassembled the work, I realized how magnificent it was, and made that revision even so late. 
 
 
      One of the highlights of this work is the captivating story, which even with some clichés, instigates you to watch more and more to the point of not even seeing the time pass. It has a beautiful beginning, a wonderful ending, and an exciting touch in the middle. A simple but well executed story. 
      But the story is not the strong point of the work, but its animation, with incredible scenarios that deserve admiration, in addition to fluid movement and design of well-made characters, every detail, every trace, every scene was made with maximum effort. One of the most beautiful animations I've ever seen, worthy of applause. 
In addition, the game is accompanied by a soundtrack of respect, an exciting opening and a closing that takes a tear out of your eyes as well as background music that fits perfectly with the excitement that the scenes go through. 
      
 The only weaknesses of the work are the secondary characters, who are not very captivating, or even uninteresting, but who do not disturb their experience. 
 
 
        With a simple but well executed story, an animation that other studios envy and a soundtrack of respect, kimi no na wa can be recommendable to anyone. Even if you do not like that job, you certainly deserve respect.

    So far into the show, I'm getting vibes similar to that of Omamori Himari and other animes that reference mystical/domestic being living together, the show dance on cliches and takes the dialogue a bit further. 
 
Some scenes where you expect a cliche to happen, the show will disarm you by self deprecating and rewarding you with a little bit of fanservice, it looks interesting and it's pretty funny so far, the main character is a bit of a dense one but the scenes between the main duo are hilarious, give this show a try. 
 
It's not over the top, it's funny and down to earth and it's starting to pick up, don't let the art style and the cover fool you, it's definitely a comedy and it's definitely ecchi

    If I wanted to watch heterosexual hentai, child pornography, general pornography or just a twisted sex tale, I would've.  
 
Boku No Pico is flat out disgusting, and wrong in every single fathomable way.It exploits children and exhibits explicit child abuse through sex with 'androgenous' Pico. This anime does nothing more than to promote child sex abuse, with the protagonist 'Tamostu' being the ultimate sexual predator. 
 
It shouldn't be classified as yaoi, as he obsesses over the idea of Pico being a girl for the entire duration of the anime. Why not just get with one? Pico is a child, used throughout the anime and he doesn't even know it. This anime glorifies everything wrong in the world.  
Sick sick sick. And not in the insightful, intriguing way, just in the horny old, nasty paedophilic perverted way.  
 
Art and Sound are brilliant. 
Story, is disgusting. If it was told from the psychological viewpoint, maybe giving insight into a pedophiles mind, it may have been a good story. But it's just a glorified child porn hentai. Not cool. 
 
The characters are flat and terrible on all frontiers. I couldn't believe what I was watching.  
 
I rate this utterly unwatchable.

    Ok, this's my first review and is for the anime adapted of my favorite manga. A little hard, hun? But the thing is: even I LOVING the manga, I really have some problems watching the anime. Yeah, it's loyal, but I think that could be much better than was.  
 
Apart from this, the anime is PRETTY GOOD. It's cute, have some awesome characters and the admissible songs. Ok, being honest, the ending isn't it all, but it's nice, and the opening is okay enough.  
 
The anime was short, so I think they had to do things short. If you don't read the manga, you'll be okay with that, 'cause the end was cute, lovely and all the thing  we dreamed in our favorites animes. But for me... I don't know, I just feel like if they they were to do a second season, so the first couldn't have that kind of end. All was fluffy (like Tomoe's ears, hehe) and all, but this bothered me. 
  
Ok, talking about Tomoe, I've to say: I just love the most part of the characters. Nanami, the main, is smart, kind and persistent, and it makes me really like her. Tomoe is the guy I want for me, and I can say that he have my heart now. Being rough, and sometimes being so sweet... Mizuki, Mikage, Kurama, these were others that I liked.  
 
In the end, I can say  I really like the anime. It's nice see a manga creating life. And, no matter what I said, I hope that have a second season.  
 
PS: People, my English isn't very good, but I tried. I just felt I had to express myself about this anime.

    I just finished it a few minutes ago. Haha. And I've felt like I must make a quick review of it. 
 
This anime is the exact lesson I should learn when it comes to being an otaku--never have high hopes for something which started incredibly good. I am a ghibli fan, and the first episode really reminded me of Spirited Away. That's why, at the back of my mind, I thought that wow..omg..this anime looks so promising..maybe it will be epic! But as I watched the preceding episodes, my high hopes are beginning to collapse. The fillers can also drag the whole story down, you know?  
 
So I ditched it out of my ongoing-anime-priority watch list. I just recently continued watching it because of the sudden developments in the love triangles of Minchi, Tohru and Ohana. It became more exciting because Ko-chan was shown again in the anime. But as other MAL formurers had said, once the plot has been full of ups and downs, the general feeling of the audience will not be the same as before. 
 
It could have been better it they made it 11-12 or 13 episodes. Maybe through that they could really show the real beauty of this coming-of-age anime--that it's not just beautiful characters and sceneries.

    Steins;Gate review by yours truly. 
 
Time machine, leaping through time, time traveler, changing the past, see the future, also Deus Ex Machina. One might call it Bull;Shit 
 
Everyone always seems to amazed by someone who talk about science. Some people understand and some people don't understand. People who understand will start an arguement and people who don't understand simply don't care. In all seriousness I don't give a crap. Science is bullshit I don't like it period. Oh wait I can make an exception if it's regarding how to make a 12 year old girl stay 12 forever. hmmm... delicious~ 
 
Story: ~How to make a green banana~ 
1. Visit porn site. 
2. A [insertyourdicksize] cm banana is ready. 
3. Put a green condom on the banana. 
MAMA MIA! 
 
Seriously, I'm confused. I don't understand jackshit! Tutturu~What's the point of her existence? How the hell a tsundere become a scientist? Tsundere are stupid. 'slap' i-it's not like i want you to touch my boobs or anything b-baka! 'slap again'  do you want me to touch yer boobs or don't you? jeez make up ur mind! 
 
Art and Animation: The eye designs were ugly as hell. 
 
Sound: Adding ''nyann'' in every fuckin' sentence... pandering(hip start movin' and she's screamin' and moan nyann all the time), fap a little if you know what I mean sir... and also tutturu~ 10/10 would fap again. 
 
Character: 
Houououin Kyouma: Wearing a lab coat so that he can look smart sonuvabitch. 
Tsundere scientist: Hawt! 
Tutturu~ bitch: Trust me she's not a virgin. 
Fat-sweaty ass otaku: Represent all otakus in the universe. 
Nyann cat: 10/10 would bang 
Gender confuse: I met him/her in Thailand also not a virgin. 
 
The directing superb because TEXHNOLYZE! 
 
Enjoyment: Well, I did enjoy it. Re-watch? Nah.

    Note: This is not a sequel at all, however, it does have the same setting (nii-san being a hentai), even so, ""different"" characters are in it, and not to mention, the arts are way better in this one. 
 
Story: 5 - There isn't an actual story to it, considering the fact that it's a 2 episodes long hentai, unless you consider their parents going away for summer is part of a plot, then you're free to do so. 
 
Art: 9 - I haven't watch/fap to many hentai, but I thought the art in this one suits me the most, mostly because they look recent and reminds me of some Rom com anime that I've watched. Overall, I though this one have the best art style. 
 
Animation: 7 - It wasn't bad, nothing special, I wish they didn't got lazy and animated the clothe removing part, though I'll admit that I'm a super hentai who gets turned on just by that. 
 
Sound: 8 - The sound are good overall, and the voicing is decent 
 
Character: 7 - We have three characters in this 2 episodes long hentai, the male lead is nii-san who pretty much have sex withthe two other female characters, one of the imouto is a tsundere, while the other is a deredere who seems pretty ok with seducing her brother. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 - I sure as hell didn't fapped twice in 3 minutes for nothing, and for the record, I,  actually watched the whole thing 3 times without fapping, yea, that's right, sweg. 
 
Overall: 8 -Decent art and voice acting, no story actual story about it, but I really don't care about stuff like that in a hemtai. Characters aren't bad, your typical taundere who denies her true feelings. 
 
My first review is about a hentai, yea, I'm gonna go brag about it now.

    ""Lastation's security is the best in the world!"" Hold on a second. Is that a Jojo reference? David Productions left Part Four of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure to make this? 
Well, I'm fine with this. I mean... It's better for you if you are a full-fledged fan of the game or something like that. For me, it looked mediocre due to how bland and simple it was. It looks much like a generic series to me. 
Overall, I think it was fair. The art style and the characters were what made it feel fair to me. I didn't like it, but I didn't hate it.

    This anime is nothing short of amazing. Comparing it to more popular anime I would say it has similarities with Your Name, Death Note and Fate, but a much darker version. 
 
 I saw that the most upvoted reviews on this anime were really low, so I would like to talk about that at first. This anime is not for everyone. It's like really really dark and sad. It has a lot of violence, religious and sexual references. If u are under 16, or you like to see a pink anime where everyone is happy this is not for you. Many people said (which is BS, in my opinion) that the story is boring. Those people obviously did NOT UNDERSTAND this anime, so I think it's an unfair to criticize it. I would be happy to talk to anyone who brings some logic arguments that this is a bad anime, but it's not. 
 
There we're some aspects I didn't like. First, was the main character which is probably, the biggest wimp in anime history in the 1st half of the series. Second, was the ending which I think we, as the viewers, would deserve to see a bit of a happier ending. However, both these ""flaws"" we're on purpose, and they did make sense, since this is a dark and sad anime. 
 
Why do I say this anime is truly a masterpiece? Well, it has everything you would expect. A diverse set of characters, which develop as the plot go on. 90% of the character developed some major changes from start to end. It had two unexpected  moments which just made go like ""Whaaattt!?"". It had probably the most lovable psychopath I have ever seen. It had the balls to address some really creepy stuff in our society, with no regards towards the regards of me as a viewer. (which some of u might hate, but from me it just gains my respect) 
 
I say this again, if u don't want a happy story and above 16 (no offense, most kids under 16 would probably not understand the plot), you HAVE to WATCH this. 
 
If the writer of this amazing anime ever sees this I would like to tell him he's done an amazing job. :) This has become one of my favorite anime.

    A quick search on google on the word ' densest ' and this is what I find , Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element, with a density of 22.59 g/cm3. To my surprise I didn't find Naho , or something close to that , maybe the scientists don't watch to many animes because if I were them I would correct that statement and put her as the most , without a match , peerless , first place for the most densest ' material ' on this planet . From the get go she was there just for the female MC , she falls in love without a reason , just because he helped her once , that's stupid even for ' plot ' reasons , runs away even if she knows what will happen if she does and many more reasons not to like her , not even one to do so .  
Onward , next stop Kakeru , a piece of garbage character , suicidal prick with no brain to even think past 3 words , ' mom ' , ' sorry ' and ' death ' . Ok we understand that you love your mother , that you are sorry that you were a douche with her and so on , but after you read her message why the hell do you have to go and kill yourself ? Her message was awesome , not something you would want to kill yourself for , she didn't blame you or anything , she fucking loved your stupid , worthless ass , but you decide to kill yourself and go to her side to apologize , I bet she would hug you , kiss your forehead and say ' Ahh what a good son I have , there there , mommy is here , have a cookie ' , that clearly won't happen , but because he is a moron he can't get past the 1+1 threshold , so yeah , I guess he is better of dead IMO .  
The saving grace of this anime , the art , except one episode , the ending song , really beautiful and ofc Suwa , the MvP that made this show watchable , if not for him this would've been a fucking disaster ...  
PS : The shadow MvP goes to Hagita for destroying the idiots bike , good job mate you deserve a girl ^_^ .

    Ever felt so unmotivated in life that you were too tired to watch even one episode of an anime? Well if that's the case Ame-iro Cocoa may help cheer you up a bit. You may well even end up having some motivation to make yourself enjoy a cup of coffee.  
 
Rainy Color is where our cute young boy Aoi works at as a coffee maker. There are three other boys who hang out at the cafe talking and gossipping about various things and that's pretty much the story. 
 
Aoi, our young coffee server is a shy boy who is often mistaken as a girl. Shion is his senior who works with him. Ryota is a happy-go-lucky guy who hangs around the cafe a lot and to his opposite is Kei the cold-hearted guy who for some unknown reason, seems to dislike Aoi. There's the owner of the Rainy Color as well but even for such a short amount of time the show covers he's only seen twice the entire series, in the second episode and the last. However, he appears in the opening song and is seen laughing hysterically for some unknown reason. The characters are neatly drawn in this anime, the backgrounds are kept simple and plain. 
 
There's a twenty five second long OP for this two-minute anime and if you see it that way the quarter of the show is covered by the song itself. But the song is pretty nice infact, and there's very little music in the show. Even if it's a very short anime the voice actors used in it are pro's. Miyano Mamoru, well known for several of his voice actings, plays the role of Ryota in Ame-iro Cocoa. 
 
Normal souls would find it pretty hard to comprehend this and I can feel them as there's pretty much nothing to be gained from watching this. This makes Ame-iro Cocoa share a similarity with another one of the short anime, Pupa. However, the two are vastly apart from being similar as Pupa tends to make itself known to its viewers for a long time using some other kinds of means which I wouldn't want to mention. As short anime's come and go Ame-iro Cocoa will certainly not be remembered, but yet this is one anime that can not be loved nor be hated.

          Toradora....where do i begin. This show is easily the best anime show I've seen in a long time, and that's saying something. Everything about it is everything i like in a good romance. The story begins with Ryuuji and Taiga first meeting. let me explain them first.  
 
     Taiga is a rough and tuff girl who wont take and crap from anybody, she is however small so this being the fact she is called the palmtop tiger, it is also later shown that her agressiveness is due to a rough childhood.  
 
     Ryuuji on the other hand is quite a soft, though everyone is afraid of him because he resembles his dad (who I think he was supposed to be like a realy bag guy, they didn't go much in depth in that area) he is very nice, and unlike Taiga is actually kind of a pushover. Anyway back to what i was saying 
 
     Taiga is caught by Ryuuji trying to put a love letter to kitamura in his bag, but ends up putting it in Ryuuji's bag. Ryuuji finds it and is tempted to read it, but he resists. Then Taiga rages in and attacks Ryuuji with a wooden sword. Once things have calmed down Ryuuji tells Taiga about the poems and what not he writes for Minorin. seeing that they each have simialar goals, and the fact that their love interest is the other best friend. They decide to work together and help each other in getting that person. However it is not very smooth sailing 
 
      Taiga is very timid around kitamura so she never can really push herself to do anything that Ryuuji plans out for her. she can barely say a word to him at the beginning of the show but towards the end she is more open with him. This I think is due to the fact that she is realising that she likes Ryuuji instead, this however doesn't happen till near the end. 
  
      Ryuuji is not near as timid around Minorin as Taiga is with kitamura, but he still mumbles his words now and then. He as well has issues with pushing himself to do what Taiga plans out for him. Toward the very end it is revealed that Minorin actually does like Ryuuji. 
 
      Taiga and Ryuuji spend alot of time together because of the fact that Taiga lives alone. Ryuuji cooks for her just about every night. Because of this Ryuuji's mother considers Taiga part of the family. 
 
      Later on as Taiga and Ryuuji spend more time together, (though they never say till the very end) they end up having feelings for each other. It does take a while for them to realise it, so sit tight and keep watching. because it is worth it. 
 
      one of the best traits about Toradora is it's suspense. I don't know how they were able to put so much suspense in a drama/romance but they did. For me this show left me wondering after every episode. It made me think and want to know what was in the next episode. I had to seriously force myself away from the computer in order to stop watching it. Because after every episode you WILL want to know what happens next!!! I gaurantee it. 
 
      Another thing about Toradora. I know in retrospect it is pretty obvious that Taiga and Ryuuji will be together, and I thought that would ruin it for me...but...it really didn't. Because though it may be obvious, it doesn't really seem sensible. It doesn't seem like they'll end up together at the beginning even though you know they will. It's crazy how this show does it but it does it excellently. 
 
      I would recommend this show to anyone who likes drama/romance cause this show does both of those PERFECTLY!! and i don't say that lightly. The background's on the character and the storyline would have made the show good even if there was no romance. I would highly recommend this anime. 
 
      Story (8) - I am giving this story an 8. Because though it did have interest, and left you wanting to know what happened. It is lacking in resolve. considering Taiga's family that is. At the end of the show Taiga's family is still mad at her for leaving, and they don't really resolve that. Though she does end up going back for a year. 
 
      Art (9) - I give this show a high 9 on art. The design of the character's wasn't my favorite design, but the show still made it work out. The art was masterful in my opinion. The work of a genius. 
 
      Sound (10) - I am giving the sound a 10 for various reasons. The emotion in this show could be felt throughout every episode. It was like you could almost feel the person's pain. even when the side character had a moment it was great. The sound is really Toradora's shining moment. 
 
      Character (9) - I am giving character's a 9. This is the kind of show that you will definitely like all of the characters. Even if you didn't like a character from the start (for me it was Minorin) you will like them towards the end. The backgrounds on all of them are all unique and all interesting. No one's background in this show is boring. 
 
      Enjoyment (10) - I have never watched a show that I have enjoyed more than Toradora. As i said before it will leave you in suspense after every episode. it will be 4 am in the morning and you will be finishing episode 17. It will end and you will lie their with your mouth open. Then you will scream because you want to go to bed but you don't want to stop watching it (WARNING!! if you don't like staying up really late than i would sudgest not watching Toradora at night.) 
 
      Overall (10) - as for the overall it obviously get's a 10. Which are well earned points. This story will not dissappoint you if you like drama/romance that leave you suspenseful and wondering. Not to mention really excited at some points. P.S. Ryuuji and Taiga do kiss at the last episode. =)

    I have a few grievances with this OVA. 
 
Firstly, who is it intended for? I assume those solely who read the manga because anyone coming off of the anime if going to have one jarring experience. Even if you put the change in art style the direction and pacing aside, this is nothing like the original series and it doesn't even try to fashion some kind of coherency between the series and the OVA leaving a good chunk of audience lost along the way. 
 
Secondly the art design, I was worried when I saw the promotional material before the OVA and it seems my worries came true because every poster they released made Sakura and Tomoyo look like card board cut outs everything felt so stiff and sure enough I got the exact same feeling from the OVA, now I know that the original series spent most of its time on still frames (Most anime does in all fairness) but just about everything felt stiff, it's like in a plea to be just like the manga they had to have everything as picture perfect as possible, I mean there are people posting screenshots of the OVA and the manga side by side for comparison and it's practically identical, but that isn't the point of animation the point is to adapt the manga not become the manga itself. 
 
And to top it all off everyone had this weird fucking shine on them 24/7 like I was half expecting when the perspective panned out away from Sakura it was going to expose a person standing there with a lightbulb inches away from her face and they just followed her around the entire thing over saturating the fuck out of everything and everyone. The effect worked when there were darker scenes like when it's evening or when we have that really cool representation of Sakura's card possession, but that was because they effect had enough contrast in those scenes to make it pop. 
 
I Just....I feel like this was rushed HEAVILY, and I prey to god that the series isn't going to have this annoying stilted and over saturation problem when it officially releases.

    In my opinion, this movie could have been great but during the movie the story went downhill. 
 
Story - 5  
I think the story at the beginning started strong! It definitely had the potential to be good story-wise but as the movie went on it fell flat to me. It was almost like there was a lot of filler bits or a lot of things just added in but not really thought out properly. It's almost like they had too many ideas and they wanted to include it all but then it made some other bits of the story either making no sense or not being necessary to include.  
 
Character - 3 
Probably the biggest let down in the whole movie. As I said at the start of this review, the start of the movie was great but the story and the character development throughout the movie are the things that made me give this movie a lower rating. My issues with the characters is the complete lack of development during the whole movie. They go through this massive adventure but it is almost like all the characters are only two dimensional. There aren't many examples I can give without giving spoilers but if you're curious I guess watch it and see...I kind of liked the cats but again there wasn't much development behind them either...just completely bland and boring which could take people by surprise due to how many events happen in this movie but what is really a good adventure without characters you actually care about?  
 
Enjoyment - 5  
Due to issues I've stated early I really didn't enjoy the movie and I constantly was waiting for it to end... 
 
Art - 9 
The art, in my opinion, was great! No complaints but sadly this was the best part of the movie for me... 
 
Sound - 6  
I thought some of the songs were okay I guess. The voice actors were okay but I did always think that the cat's sounds just sounded so much unlike a cat it just became annoying. 
 
Overall - 6  
I guess the art style kind of redeems the movie a little bit but barely...I wouldn't watch it by choice that is why I regret buying this movie...I guess it looks good on my shelf...idk haha but yeah It could have been great if they took their time, didn't rush the story, made it simpler and actually developed the characters. Personally Ii wouldn't recommend.

    The story of this anime begins with a kingdom where the queen was blamed to start a coup d'etat against the kingdom after the death of king (her husband). So the first prince of the kingdom Yaiba accuses her for it. Meanwhile she sends away her second son tsurugi with the help of an android striker who knows to play battle spirit game well. So this is the epilogue. This series is about playing battle spirits card game and the most powerful players are those with ""sword eyes"" . There are 6 sword eyes (white, red, purple, yellow, green and blue), those who have the sword symbol in right eye represent light and to have it in left eye meant to be of dark forces. Now the entire series progresses for the aim of attaining a sword which will appear when all the 12 (light side 6 + dark side 6). 
 
Art: Upto today's animation standards. Clear in outlines etc. 
 
Music : There is no opening song. 
 
Characters: Except Yaiba, that is first son of the queen none were strong characters. Yaiba shown to be strong while taking decisions for the kingdom. He was unshakable to the kingdom struggles but he always looked after his people safety. Whenever there is a disturbance in the environment, yaiba through public broadcasting assured people that there is nothing for them to be afraid of. He never shown to suppress his people.  
 
Drawbacks of the series: 
 
1. Characterization is poor. 
2. Battle Spirits game time depletes its effect on viewers when it is combined with the aftermath story. 
3. The three seers are just for comedy. They are not at all powerful. 
4. Sword eyes light side characters except haqua, all others get defeated easily. Especially the ninja is so comedic.  
 
Overall enjoyment. It made me feel like it is waste of time. Battle spirits series has its worst sequel. I am making these comments only after watching its sequel too.

    First I have to say that I'm watching 8 other anime at the time im writing this so if I miss anything don't get too upset.  
 
Now, my first impressions of this show are mainly positive, it may not be one I'll rewatch but for the creepy, loner type main charecter theme that they have going on, the story managed to work very well. The main charecters personality was a breath of fresh air when it seems that most anime are focusing on stereotypes recently. The charecters grow together throughout the story. 
 
I was pleasantly surprised with this anime, I thought it might be one I dropped but the charecters and situations all work together beautifully to make this anime unique in many ways. 
 
Personally I would recommend this anime to any who want a bit of a change. It's sound and music are nearly silent but still serve to enhance the scenes.

    Shiki is a slow anime, bear this in mind first.  
 
How slow? the starting 8 episodes u just have to shut up watch. its that slow. But after that the story picks up and is really good. 
 
How good? remember Game of Thrones? the one in which u slogged almost till the part where Ned Stark dies and then u were all like OMG!!! ? Shiki is like that. but it's not bad n slow till the end, just the first 8 episodes.  
 
Even then the story is a little slow. But this is one of the anime which really stays true to its genre of horror, psychological and mystery. Want a comparison? if u think 'Another' was good, after finishing Shiki u would feel like this is on another level of psychological horror. 
 
So if u r a little patient and really like anime in this genre, go ahead and watch this. Shiki wont disappoint u.

    I am rather disappointed with this series.  I've seen 2 episodes and I've noticed a recurring theme: FANSERVICE.  This really irritates me.  In my opinion it really pulls away from where the focus needs to be (which is on the characters).  This series has a great deal of potential.  However, with the overwhelming focus on T&amp;A shots, There's no way for me to enjoy this.  As a note, add 2-3 points to my &quot;Overall&quot; score if you really like fanservice.

    Oh my, I would say that this show, specifically the second season is what truly helped me become a full on weeb. Before finding and watching this show, I would only watch Dragon Ball and Naruto and thinking that they are the entirety of what anime has to offer. But oh my, after watching this, I realized what more there is to be offered in the world of anime. This show opened my eyes, and even after watching so many shows, I still see this as one of the best shows I have watched to this date, anime or non-anime. The characters were all very memorable, the story line was amazing, the music worked perfectly with what was going on in the show, the animation was very good, not the best I've ever seen, but definitely a step above the rest in my opinion. There are very few anime which have really managed to give the same level enjoyment that I get from this. Definitely one of the best shows I have ever watched and I definitely recommend.

    My appraisal: 
 
From also taking into account the two films (they are not proper entities through directly following on from the last episode and hence shouldn’t be treated as such) it can conclusively be said that the crew have proved themselves as highly proficient in making an otherwise well-rounded piece but that such an ambitiously grand-scale concept was still beyond their full grasp. 
 
The premise had the possibility to become an engagingly hypothetical- and profoundly relevant during its initial airing- look at how the infrastructure of society can be subtly manipulated and improved upon but it is largely squandered in the fleshing out of the story that is too insistent on bringing in action sequences. With being nonsensically forced into a life-or-death game (it does appear logical but is actually rather ill-conceived and counterproductive) the characters who are given a reasonable opportunity to put their ideas to fruition often don’t take it to heart through instead resorting to extremism (in the loosest sense) and spitefully playing cat-and-mouse. There are glimpses of innovative ideologies with far-reaching consequences but ultimately this production is content in remaining as an effective outlet for the grievances of those feeling suppressed in a saturated society and the committee would be wise to reboot this and realize its true potential.

    Art - The art is very straight forward just like the Main Character Hina. It doesn't have extraordinary hairstyle or character design but the art style fits perfectly with the genre. This kind of art style has its own charm and it makes this manga even more hilarious. 
 
Sound - The OST is fine. But I loved the ending song more. 
 
Character - Yakuza. Esper. Bartended. Office worker and few other normal people. But don't underestimate these lineup.  
 
Story - Refreshing storyline if you want a slice-of-life comedic anime. If the anime interests you, you'll find the manga more interesting. 
 
Most readers get bored after a few chapter if the comedic formula is repetitive. But Hinamatsuri does not make readers feel that way. Every chapter has its own to way to make people laugh. Readers will not get easily bored. 
 
 
Overall enjoyment is great.

    There is always a catalyst that provokes the journey that a person takes to become wicked and twisted. This could not be more true for Future Diary. Yuki is an observer in his own life, not really interacting greatly with the events around him, simply watching and recording the events of his day to day life in his diary on his cellphone. When he finds out that he has been placed in a survival game of life and death with 11 other players, Yuki must  defeat the other players so that he can replace the current deteriorating God of the world. The only twist is…all the other players have diaries of their own, each with a unique ability that depended prior to the commencement of the game. 
 
In this game, we have two main characters, Yuki and his crazy, stalker classmate, Yuno. With pink hair and matching pink eyes, Yuno claims to be in love with Yuki, yet it’s not clear exactly how far she will go to secure their relationship until Yuki develops the literal skeletons in her closet.  
 
Yuki, as a protagonist feels way too unreal. At the start of the anime, he was unobtrusive, mostly indifferent, yet also cowardly. When he gets chosen to take part in the game, finally he begins to interact with people and make friends and foes. As he is socially inept, his malleable nature allows him to become a tool in the game, able to be wielded by whoever he can easily come to trust. The viewer is always waiting in anticipation for when he will finally snap and become the victor, by taking a stand for his desire to win the game. The events that provoke this certainly do come, yet his personality switch feels so sudden and unnatural that it messes with the flow of the anime. He feels little to no remorse for the events that follow after he switches off his humanity. The crazy personality that he begins to adopt is ill-fitting because he didn’t have an abusive childhood, mostly a neglectful one, where he didn’t get the attention he most desperately desired. Yuki himself begins to do things without reason which is at war with his seemingly moral personality at the start and the transition does not seem to make the most sense.  
 
Finally, he finds someone willing to give him the attention, Yuno. Though she is mentally very unstable, can kill with glee and wipe her memory to allow her ultimate ruthlessness, Yuki grows to develop a real connection with her because she goes to any length to protect him. The story is truly about Yuno and the mystery surrounding her because she is able to manipulate Yuki to her will once she establishes a strange sort of trust between them. Yuno is a cleverly crafted character. Though she is mostly a love-sick puppy at her core, desperate herself for emotional support, the journey that she took to become the person that she is in the survival game is an intriguing one that certainly keeps you guessing. 
 
The well developed characters do not stop there! With 11 other players, we certainly have a lot of names and identities to keep track off throughout this anime. Though some are more forgettable than others, the unique motives behind each character’s desire to become God and the distinguishing character design keeps this anime entertaining. From the creepy and weirdly intelligent Rei, to the seemingly simple, yet complex Minene, to the one with hidden motives, who seems to have his fingers in a lot of pies, Akise. 
 
There are definitely a lot of characters to keep track off, but this anime does a good job at reintroducing them and weaving them expertly into the appropriate moments of the plot. The art style is really well done in some aspects, especially towards the end when the action escalates with the stunning battle scenes, yet some of the character’s facial features begin to look a bit uniform at some points. The soundtrack is top notch, with the final ending song being my favourite, as it is super atmospheric.  
 
This anime is dark, twisted and a mystery, yet it somehow manages to weave in moments of comic relief in there. We, like Yuki struggle to hate Yuno, yet still keep her at an arms length after discovering her crazy nature. Go check this anime out to find out who will win the game of survival to become the ultimate God for yourself.

    Blood+ is an anime about vampires and one special vampire hunting them down.  I can’t say I haven’t seen that before.  I have seen worse vampire anime and definitely worse vampire stories in general.  However, at the same time, there are better vampire anime out there as well like Vampire Hunter D or Hellsing.  Hell, why stop at anime.  Watch stuff like the Blade movies.  This series seems very much like Blade in a lot of ways.  You have a main character, Saya (in this case a woman), who is a powerful and special vampire (supposedly) who wields a cool-looking sword and slays other vampires.  I can tell you that Blade could kick Saya’s ass any day of the week.  I would much rather watch Blade and Blade 2 than this anime.  I would watch this over Blade Trinity but that’s not saying much.  There will be some SPOILERS from here on so be warned.  
 
Let’s get the good points out of the way.  Firstly, the art and animation is good for the most part.  For an anime that came out in 2005 the visuals are good.  The animation during the fights was usually fluid and some of the action seasons are decent mainly ones involving the Shiva lies.  The music is also good.  All the openings are great and will get you hyped until you realize what you’re watching.  The ending songs are okay and the score does its job. 
 
One of the main issues I have with this anime is the characters.  I find most if not all of them boring, uninteresting, or just whiny.  If you like the characters that’s fine, but I was not invested in any of them.  At first I was invested in Saya’s character but as the series progressed I became less and less interested.  Many people think Saya is a great character and a very strong female lead, but I did not see that really.  Saya would not be in my top 10, 20, or even top 30 lists of best female characters in anime.   
 
She’s not badass.  Her fights are honestly pretty dull.  Plus, she almost always has to get saved by her Shiva lie Haji, her brother Kai, Solomon, or somebody else.  Haji does most of the work in fights and Saya then has the finishing blow.  She is also whiny and indecisive.  I could forgive it at the beginning because she is still adjusting to everything.  However, as the series went on her indecisiveness grated on me.   
 
Diva is even worse.  She is built up as the main villain and a massive threat, but she wasn’t really.  She wasn’t that great of a fighter and her personality and motivation was really weird.  At first she wanted to kill Saya, then she wanted Riku but then kills him,, then it seems like she wanted to sing, then at the end I guess what she wanted was a family.  It is really confusing.  Did the writers want us to feel sympathy toward her at the end?  She tried to kill Saya multiple times, she killed Saya’s real father, killed Riku, and took on Riku’s appearance as a final insult.  She gets no sympathy from me.  If she did really want a family then that’s a rather weak motivation for the main villain.   
 
Diva’s Shiva lies were more of the main villains than she was and they seemed stronger too.  They are the ones with the grand scheme to take over the world and replace humans with Chiropterans, not Diva.  Even though Saya and Diva are supposed to be the head vampires their servants seem stronger than they are judging by what I’ve seen each of them do compared to Saya and Diva.  I know Saya and Diva’s blood is deadly to them, but from an ability and combat efficiency standpoint they seem better.  The Shiva lies get all the good fights.  I am never hyped to see Saya and Diva fight.  I always wait for Haji or the other Shiva lie to come fight or fight each other.  The final fight between Saya and Diva is pathetic.  While that was happening you had Haji fighting Diva’s head Shiva lie and that was a much better fight. 
 
Also, it is so boring.  This anime is fifty episodes in length and it could have easily been half that if not even less.  It really shows in the pacing, which is slow and tiring.  There are some episodes where barely anything happens.  The story isn’t big or complicated enough to warrant being as long as it is.  The plot is pretty straightforward and there are really no twists or turns.  Diva’s Shiva lies want to replace humanity with Chiropterans as top of the food chain and Saya and her group has to stop them.  You could’ve easily resolved that in a 25 episode series or even a 12 or 13 episode series.   
 
Plus, there’s the whole love triangle between Saya, Haji, and Solomon (Diva’s Shiva lie) which falls into Twilight territory.  Okay, it’s not that bad but it does give off that Twilight vibe to me, which isn’t a good thing.  People give this anime’s successor, Blood-C, a lot of shit.  That series, while not perfect, is better than this.  Blood-C is much shorter so the pacing is better, the action is better I think, the lead heroine does more, and there is no Twilight-esk love story in there.   
 
Overall, Blood+ soap opera making as a vampire anime.  The action scenes involving the Shiva lie are decent but the rest is just dull.  It’s too long and the pacing is super slow.  The main character, Saya, is boring, indecisive, and not that strong overall.  The other characters aren’t any better.  The villains are weak especially Diva.  Her motivation is all over the map, she didn’t come off as this badass ultimate villain, and she doesn’t really do much.  Her servants seem more like the main villains.  They have more screen time than she does.  They are the one that have the grand scheme in mind while diva just seems to be just going along with it.  The only characters that are somewhat worth anything are Haji and Solomon.  As I said previously there is much better vampire fiction out there.  It is definitely not the worst but I’d skip it.

    I really liked this anime for its visual style, the great music and the humorous characters. 
But really, thats it. 
No story, no character developments, no coherence, nothing to be excited about! 
 
This anime could have been so much more with a great story. Instead, its a bunch of stand-alone episodes, all destined to be forgotten, because there is nothing that keeps them together. 
 
I really liked Dandy and I wish there was a great story for him to unfold during this anime, but all we see is a glimpse of his and every other side characters background. why even show that, if its absolutely redundant? That was frustrating for me. 
It seems to me like a typical anime nower days...great visuals and style, very cool characters, but no depth to them! Which makes them absolutely replacable. Too bad!

    Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a fun, vibrant, swashbuckling adventure in such a clusterfuck setting. To quote Tolkien's ""On Fairy Stories"", it's a Secondary World that does not inspire Secondary Belief. But it works for the kind of story Genesis attempted. Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul attempts to expound on that simple narrative with a far more ambitious story, one that is set up to fail in the light of the world built in Genesis. The established world simply does not hold up to scrutiny once a more serious narrative repeatedly brings forth its glaring flaws. 
 
Virgin Soul is set 10 years after the events of Genesis, under a new social equilibrium and power dynamic of a new world order. Enter the ubermensch, super-powered, menacingly armored humans under the control of the king. With humanity's newfound might, they now waged war upon gods and demons. The latter has been soundly defeated years ago and made slaves under the cruel whip of the species they once tormented. 
 
Here, the most glaring problem arises almost immediately. Ethics, morality, socio-economic realities, these are such complicated concepts for a setting with so many holes and so many facets still left unestablished. 
 
The power dynamics introduced in Genesis is one where humans fight an eternal war with demons, with the occasional help from the gods thrown in. One can infer from the events in Genesis that humans are merely proxy in the wars of the gods and demons. It's so simplistic in nature and now that the wheels had turned, you cannot bring yourself to care. Now humanity has the upper hand and by god, they have every right to hold demons in contempt and to flaunt their power against the gods whose whims and fancy they are no longer under the mercy of. 
 
And what is ethics? At what state of social equilibrium is this world under? How do they view slavery? A necessary evil in rebuilding? A proof of humanity's triumph? This should clue you in to how secure or how tenuous the king's hold is and how the events of the story changes that. 
 
On the side of the gods, their effort to bring humanity back into their fold calls forth into question the benefits of such an arrangement. Aside from ready cannon fodder which seems to be composed entirely of one kingdom, there is no other stated benefit for their leader to be feverish about. There is still the matter of survival, though certain conversations side-line that in favor of the idea that humanity, that the sheep has strayed from the flock and requires a shepherd. Or maybe the gods are the supreme arbiter of the world order? Except that the events of Genesis says otherwise. 
 
What is faith? How does it work in pantheon of what seems to be a shit-ton of deities? Are angels gods? Are they minor deities? What do they inspire in people? We have a world where deities have physical manifestations. Surely its not your usual Abrahamic belief? 
 
It's hard to be invested in a setting you keep questioning. Other reviewers will say the failure of Virgin Soul lies in the characters or the story. They are wrong. The failure of Virgin Soul lies in the setting that should have given more depth to the story and more nuance to the characters and their decisions. 
 
Exploring nuance in the politics and ethics of a setting with the barest of social equilibrium... it's simply isn't done. Especially so when much of the meat of Virgin Soul before the final third of its runtime is an attempt at that. 
 
Not much else can be said about Virgin Soul. If you know your Gaise Macon, your Arthas Menethil, your Lelouch Lamperouge, then you've seen this story done better, even by such an infinitesimal degree.

    Hilarious.  It was always exciting to go on to the next episode.  The characters are well-formed and are great foils to each other.  It has a great balance of light-hearted humor and deep-soul drama. High rewatchablility.

    This does not deserve it's hype. Actually, how did it even get hyped in the first place? 
 
This show? Basically fanservice, fanservice, fanservice, more fanservice, boobs, explosions, boobs, explosions.  
 
The main character's reactions to everything made absolutely no sense and had no rationality whatsoever. My adoptive sister is suddenly the commander of a floating invisible airship? Okay, cool. She wants me to date potentially life-threatening girls who can flatten a suburb in a matter of seconds and kiss them? SURE! No problem!  
 
I don't even care if this spoils the beginning, hopefully you won't make the same mistake as me and watch this garbage.  
 
I have the lowest standards for anime out of anyone I know. I enjoy anime people find horrible, but this was just unbearable. I think the only noteworthy character was Kurumi, because she was the only character that didn't drop to their knees within two episodes. 
 
Avoid it, however you can. It's bad.

    Thanks for tuning in to another one of my reviews. This time, under the spotlight is 
 
Re:Starting Life in Another World from Zero, Re:Zero for short. 
 
This blurb right here is for those who don’t want spoilers and just want to see if they should watch the show or not. Short answer from me: most definitely. This’ll either be a show that will completely engross you or fail to capture even an iota of interest. There are times where people have completed the show and have been ambivalent towards Re:Zero, but those cases are the exception. Try it out, and if you don’t like it at all, move on. No harm done. If you think even a tiny bit that this show might interest you, stick around and get ready for an amazing ride. 
 
Now, from this point forward there will be spoilers, and very heavy spoilers. If you don’t want plot points or the ending leaked to you, turn back now.  
 
This is a general summary of what I plan to say in the entire review, for those who don’t want to read through the whole thing. This show follows the young man Subaru Natsuki, a typical-yet-kind-of-lame 18 year old teenage male in our modern society, as he experiences both friendship and tragedy in new his life in an unfamiliar fantasy world. Now, the previous sentence was extremely important. Read it over again for good measure. Done? Great. If you actually understood that one sentence, you don’t need to read my review anymore because that’s all I have to say.  
 
Re:Zero isn’t primarily about friendship, cool powers, ideals, thematic conflict, overarching story, symbolism, or even waifus. Re:Zero is about Subaru, and what he experiences as he tries to live his life in another world from zero. All the people that have been complaining about Subaru’s actions, choices, and characteristics have been voicing their opinions for nothing. You aren’t going to find the ideal protagonist that makes the right choices and has the ability to do everything. If that’s what you’re looking for, I can direct you to another young man named Kirito, courtesy of Sword Art Online. Re:Zero is meant to be an anime following an average and relatable character, nothing more and nothing less. If this is the case, what’s so special and fantastic about an anime that just follows this typical-yet-kind-of-lame 18 year old teenage male in a fantasy world? Why watch as your favorite waifu is mutilated and killed five thousand times over because Subaru is too weak to save her? Why endure how frustrating it is to watch Subaru make mistakes and fuck up every single time he comes back from the dead? The majesty of this show comes in the realization that you aren't supposed to be merely ""watching"" Re:Zero. Instead, as a viewer, you are drawn into Subaru's perspective and feel everything that he feels. Did Subaru mess up and have everyone he cares about die in front of his eyes? Subaru’s probably feeling like crap right now, similar to the feeling in the pit of the viewer’s stomach. Did Best Girl Rem just confess her love to Subaru even though he hates himself? Subaru’s probably pretty damn happy to have ReZero’s greatest waifu offer her support to him, and the viewer has been completely smitten by the blue-haired maid. Re:Zero boils down to this: you're on the same train with Subaru and will feel exactly what he feels. That's the magic behind this show: there aren't any other anime that can get viewers this emotionally invested in the characters and plot. The show stays true to itself to the very end, working off your emotions and effectively putting you in Subaru's shoes throughout his journey.  
 
Damn, THAT was the summary? Yup. Moving on to objective analysis of all the different aspects of Re:Zero. 
 
Story: 7/10 
The story’s not bad. It’s nothing fantastic either, because the whole show is meant to be following Subaru’s experiences and how he copes with the situations he’s put in. Outside of following Subaru, the plot is generic and shallow, but well executed and smooth. 
 
Art: 8/10 
I don’t know what to say other than that I think the show looks pretty good aesthetically. I think it’s pretty good art, but to each their own. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
I thought the soundtrack was amazing. I extremely enjoy listening to the ending themes and I’ve grown to love the second opening. The soundtrack during critical moments in the show only add to the emotional value of certain scenes like Rem’s confession, or Subaru’s confession to Emilia at the very end. Having voice actors sing is always a plus. Keep in mind that like the art, soundtrack is something very difficult to conduct an objective overview of, even if you are a musical expert.  
 
Character: 10/10 
Re:Zero introduced a decently large cast of characters and pulled it off excellently. Though some characters did not receive as much development as others, this is easily explained by the fact that Re:Zero is supposed to be a show that follows Subaru. Because the show is supposed to be from Subaru’s perspective, it’s obvious that Subaru and those that were with him the most received the most development.  
 
Character development was uniquely executed in Re:Zero, again confirming how the show is only supposed to be documenting Subaru’s standpoint. Every single character is introduced as a stranger to Subaru, and they are developed as Subaru gets to know them better. Learning about all the characters in Re:Zero is extremely comparable to actually meeting new people, because we watch from Subaru’s perspective as characters initially skeptical of his identity learn to accept him as a comrade. We also see from Subaru’s perspective how he learns to accept the people he initially butts heads with. Re:Zero makes good use of the Return By Death power to develop characters, as characters are given the chance to react to different scenarios in the same setting. Subaru, along with the viewers, picks up on character behavior and builds character profiles with better accuracy as the show goes on. 
 
Furthermore, the characters in Re:Zero are extremely easy to empathize with because of how human they appear to be. All the characters are shown to make mistakes, get overwhelmed, and feel strong emotion. As entertaining as it is to watch Goku and Saitama, it is a wholly superior experience to be able to stand alongside characters that are tangibly human in their behavior and their traits. This is where Re:Zero does us good: it provides a relatable perspective with Subaru’s point of view and introduces very human characters that we can form meaningful connections with.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I was just as skeptical and confused with Re:Zero as everyone else was, until I realized that the show’s primary goal is to give the viewer a perspective into the world of Re:Zero from Subaru’s eyes. After this revelation, I really started to appreciate subtleties in Re:Zero that I wouldn’t have noticed otherwise. Return By Death, killing important characters, and Subaru’s mediocrity is all explained by the fact that the show is created let the viewers live through Subaru’s perspective.  
 
Overall: 9/10 
Re:Zero’s ability to accurately project Subaru’s feelings into the viewers makes it a very impressive anime, if not the only of its kind. With characters that are easy to get attached to, a world that one can just get lost in, amazing OST, and complementary visuals, Re:Zero gets a 9/10. Its lack of a concrete story outside of following Subaru’s point of view and lack of a concrete resolution at the ending stops it from earning a 10/10. 
 
This show’s greatest strength, and the reason why I enjoy it so much, is how powerfully it can make viewers empathize with Subaru. Even people who hate Subaru probably found themselves in his shoes, feeling bits of regret and guilt when he was unable to deal the Witch’s Cult and arrived at the mansion to find Rem, Ram, Petra, and Emilia’s bloodied corpses. Even people who prefer Rem over Emilia probably found a little bit of happiness during Subaru and Emilia’s special scene at the end. This has been the first and will probably be one of the only times where an anime has been able to communicate such strong and complex feelings to the viewers on a consistent basis and throughout each episode. It’s as if watching this show lets you Start Life in Another World from Zero. *cue Styx Helix*

    A filler that takes place during the last episode of the series, two days before the big event. There is the introduction of a new tenant while the former ones stir up trouble once again during their pre-celebration party as an old rival returns and Kyoko is anticipating a mysterious letter. 
 
It's produced by a different studio so it looks quite different - especially the characters. Animation's quite rough. It kind of fits in but also kind of doesn't considering the atmosphere because in the TV series it felt like a trusting bond was finally forged but then here, it suggests there's still some insecurity. 
 
You won't be missing much if you didn't watch this but it might be worth a watch if you want to see some expansion on how the supporting characters ended up the way they did in the last episode of the TV series.

    Dragon Crisis isn't a show that I would call good or really recommend, yet it still gave me entertainment as I watched it. 
 
The anime starts with the main character Ryuuji being pulled out of school by his ""cousin,"" Eriko to go search for a Lost Precious, ancient artifacts imbued with some magical power, that she believes to be stolen from her.   So they drive to the docks, where they then sit there for hours because the people who are arriving with the Lost Precious aren't arriving until very late that night (so why the heck did she pull him from school?). Moving on, they steal the very large crate that they believe to contain the lost precious, which actually contain a 14 year old blond girl. The people who they got the crate from aren't too happy so they chase after them. The girl then shoots out a giant blast of flames from this rose pattern on her hand to get rid of their pursuers. Turns out that that girl is really the Red- Dragon 
 
At that point in the anime, I thought that this was going to be a really cool an awesome show about magic battles with these dragons , the Breakers (people who can use the Lost Preciouses like Ryuuji and Eriko), and other magical creatures.  actually most of the anime is like that.  But it goes absolutely no where.   The 11th episode tries to bring in some huge and shocking twist, but fails to leave you with the shock because they don't explain why you should be shocked at all! 
 
You want to know why I kept watching the anime?  Well, half of episode one has Rose, that red-dragon girl, running around naked in her DFC glory, hugging Ryuuji every chance she gets. Rose is the main reason why I even watched this show.  She is just very cute and appeals to a decent amount of people.  Maybe she could have been a bit older, but she's cute none the less. 
 
Aside from all the ecchi and what not, there were many decent fight scenes in the anime.  Each episode had a new sort of force that they were fighting, and some new women that Ryuuji meets along the way. 
 
And the ending to the anime leaves you with all the girls all swooning over him.  At least he is a man who fights and not one of those other wimpy characters in a harem-ish anime.   
 
Story: Doesn't really go anywhere and there is no real plot.  The fight scenes were good and they had meaning, but they were all separate events and had very little to do with one another. 
 
Art: I liked the art style, but it felt a bit off somehow. 
 
Sound: I very much enjoyed the characters voices (especially Rose's!!) and I really like the Opening Song, but nothing special. 
 
Characters: The women were all lovely and Ryuuji was a cool an tough guy who I was glad that he was the main character. 
 
Enjoyment: I somehow got a lot of enjoyment from watching this anime, but then again I always really like animes like this one even if they aren't that good of a show.  
 
My final rating for the show would be a 7.  It's not a good anime, but it's not a bad one either.  If you are into shows that are a harem-like anime paired with some action and fight scenes, then you'll love this.  If not, I would watch one episode just to give it a chance, but you might not like it.  It's a real hit or miss show.

    I was very hesitant in starting this anime for some reason, but now that I've finished it I regret not starting it any sooner. This has become one of my favorite anime's because it is so awfully cute and the characters really get to you. The plot isn't a complicated one, and the characters themselves are what bring the most out of the anime. We have an airhead, a shy girl, a somewhat tomboy, a rich character who doesn't know a lot of commoner things, a little sister with a sister complex, and a younger club member who kinda looks like a cat.  The way the show is carried out and the interactions between the characters is one of the best things about the show. The music the characters sing is cute and fluffy and most of the ending songs are actually really nice. Overall, I highly recommend this anime, it's so cute and you grow attached to the characters, and their music

    ""A potential that has been wasted"" 
 
That is how I should sum up Moyashimon. It has a good grip on comedy but there's not enough of it going through the whole 11 episodes. There's some educational elements injected here and there but the lessons didn't attract my interest both in whatever they're teaching and the story itself. What did interest me is it's difference in whatever was being subbed at the time. Let's see, it's called ""Tales of Agriculture"". Yes. It sounded boring but it did pique my interest. 
 
The simplicity in both art and sound works for the anime for some odd reason. Almost everyone can tell that they busted their budget on the OP which is the best thing going for this anime. 
 
The second best thing going for this anime is the lead character. The funny scenes usually involve him and something gross happening. The other characters are just there to fill up the screen so there's really nothing going for them. 
 
It isn't bad ""BAD"" but anyone can live without watching this unique piece of anime that seems to have lost its direction halfway through. However, if you're like me who has a tendency to lean towards the ""road less travelled"" then just try it out. It wouldn't kill you.

    So clever of the makers of Trigun to come out with a movie over 12 years later! This movie had a great plot, and in the first 15 minutes, it already had Vash cracking me up! Of course, Vash lets the bad guys escape, and it effects Ameilas whole life. She is 'allergic' to men and cannot stand the very sight of Vash. Gasback, then finally returns to get revenge on his old crew that planned to kill him 20 years ago. And Wolfwood is helping him! At least Wolfwood is only doing it since Gasback saved him from dehydration. Vash runs into Millie and Meryl once again, and all of them go to a bar with Amelia. They all get drunk, and Amelia causes trouble until Vash helps out. The two then start to bond a bit. The next day, Vash and Amelia chase Gasback around until Vash was shot and presumed dead for days. After Wolfwoods favor for Gasback is over, he helps Amelia to beat him down. After the two are caught, Vash comes in to save the day! He survives.... because a piece of food blocked the bullet! After Vash defeats Gasback, Amelia reveals her mothers tragic death, and how them knowing Gasback killed her mother. In the end, everyone has a peaceful ending. Except for the bad guys of course.

    Re:Zero is an Isekai that starts by threatening to be self aware and heady and ends up being a dramatic and action packed fantasy thriller. It has some disturbing and harsh imagery, which juxtapose very uniquely with it's cute and bright characters and settings. 
 
Organization - 2/2 - Good flow and pacing despite a dry episode or two. 
Action/Drama - 2/2 - Fighting and emotions fly in a way that hits home. I cried and gripped my seat. 
Concepts - 3/4 - I'm a sucker for time shenanigans. Maybe too much focus on characters. 
Aesthetics - 2/2 - Everything looks good and the quality is consistent. The characters look diverse and interesting. The voice acting is great (in japanese). 
 
At times, the main character (MC) is infuriatingly stupid and at other times he's a super cool dude. While the show seems to change gears a couple times I think it turns out well. The fantasy world the author built is quite interesting and the way the MC navigates it are quite interesting. The worlds lore is presented in a relatively natural way (Not too much exposition), which is refreshing for an anime. While I found myself annoyed with the MC at the beginning of the first and last plot arcs, the show was extremely fun and I find myself wanting a second season.

    In my mind, Cowboy Bebop is the perfect show for people you know who say ""Anime? What are you, 12?""  
 
It's slick, it's funny, it's serious, and it knows how to avoid anime stereotypes. It has characters that you'll never get tired of, plot twists that will keep you watching up late at night, epic fight scenes, and a soundtrack that is worth shelling out for. 
 
With that said, let's roll. 
 
Story: 9 
 
Though it wanders on occasion, I'd like to say that nearly 100% of the time it's to develop characters further or to add a bit of humor. The Star Trek parody episode was a bit over the top (but enjoyable), and to me it's hard to enjoy enjoy the filler episodes as much as the ones where sh*t really gets real. But let's delve into those. WOW. The last two episodes of the show are as good as it gets in anime. Not to mention the 5th episode, or the back-to-back ones that take place on Mars. I won't ruin any story elements, but look forward to these. If you take anything from this review, take this: those 5 episodes are worth watching over, and over, and over, for any anime fan. 
 
Art: 8 
 
It's tough to write a review now for a show that took place as long ago as it did, but I'll give it a shot. It's well drawn, and well animated, but it's nothing mindblowing. I remember seeing the first episode fight scenes and being thoroughly impressed, but for me the main draws of the show were always the music, the characters, and the story. I can't say I've ever been much of an art critic, but for the most part is was aesthetically pleasing. I was certainly impressed by the character design, and the world that the artists created was both interesting and desirable.  
 
Sound: 10 
 
Yoko Kanno honestly outdid herself this time. In all my years of watching anime, this is the first time I've really felt like I NEEDED the soundtrack. Great OP, great songs throughout, great everything. So impressed with what she did here. 
 
Character: 9  
 
How can you not love Spike Spiegel or Faye Valentine? They're the ones that you'd like to be in real life. To me, it's not just how badass the characters are, it's the ideals they represent. Honor, bravery, and an unwillingness to let anything stand before something that you know in your heart is right. The only comparison that I can make here is a show called Firefly, which isn't an anime but in some ways reminds me of Bebop. Great design, great execution, and I wouldn't get sick of any of them even if the show went on for 100 eps.

    First of all, super outstanding poster for a hentai 12/10 
 
・Story 6/10 
It's about a cutie works as a nurse. Mana-chan thinks she's so innocent, like an angel, cause she does things to help others and all, but in reality she can't even distinguish which is right or wrong. In the end, with the power of ignorance, Mana ruined herself and then unintentionally, destroyed the person she loves so much... 
 
・Art 10/10  
Masterpiece, every details, madness movements, awesome for fap materials 
(why almost all hentai ain't even half this good) 
 
・Sound 10/10 
Having all best sfx I haven't seen for a while, also with a cute little ending song 
 
・Character 8/10 
Everything was fine until Kazama Mana-chan said ""Chocolate is delicious"" 
 
・Enjoyment 6/10 
So good but too short 
30 min. is never enough, I want more hot stuff!! 
 
・・・Overall - a 6.9/10 from me 
Yup, those ""scat scenes"" (BIG WARNING) came out of no where making me go nuts :(

    This is my first rewiew,so i will give it my best. 
STORY 10/1O 
Story is just excelent,it makes you want to watch more and more.It starts a little boring at first,the main character meeting friends...But later it becomes more exicting. 
Art 10/8 
The battle scenes are great. 
Sound 10/9 
The set of the voice actors is great,but the opening and ending needs a bit more work. 
Charathers 10/9 
All of the charathers are very funny and serious at the time.Rin and his brother aro so badass at some times. 
Overall 10/10 
This show is so exicting that makes you want more.If you want a shounen anime this is for you. 
 
Thanx for reading.

    ,,Hey let’s put bunch of girls into japanese WWII plane’s cockpits and make them fight some air pirates!“ 
 
This is how you can describe the plot in one sentence. But saying just this won’t be really fair, so let’s take a closer look. 
 
If you‘re familiar with an old videogame called Crimson Skies, and you like it, then there’s a huge chance, that you will like this as well. Airships used instead of carriers? Air pirates? Dogfights? Yes everything is here, just like in CS. But unlike in CS, this show is not from pirate’s point of view, but from the other side instead. You will follow a small female mercenary squadron called ,,Kotobuki Squadron“ on their adventures. So much for the plot, most of the screen time is reserved for dogfights anyways. Now let’s move to technical aspects, shall we? 
 
Art and Visuals 
 
This is something questionable. We have impressive  CGI plane models and animations, with the same attention to details,that we can find in GuP (no doubt since both shows have the same director). However, and this is probably the biggest problem of the show, unlike GuP, which uses traditional animation for characters, Kotobuki uses CGI not just for the machines, but also for people. Especially for the main characters. And that’s the problem. With this amount of CGI characters used, the show feels more like a cutscene from Bandai Namco game, than anime. They should’ve sticked to use CGI only for vehicles, where it works really great, for example that unforgettable engine starting sequence in the first episode, that was just pleasure to watch.To make it simple, the vehicle visuals and animations are stunning, but the decision to use CGI for characters makes the overall visuals kinda odd. 
 
Sounds and Music 
 
OP is great, it resembles the atmosphere of sandy wasteland in alternative 1930s-1940s (which is most likely, when and where the show takes place, judging by the usage of WWII airplanes).In terms of sounds, I like them, especially gunshots and engine sounds. 
 
Characters 
 
There’s not much to say, we have almost no backstory nor character development (but we sometimes get some hints about character's past, and  
we also know, that there is a one girl who loves pancakes). The Kotobuki Squadron consists of 6 girls, however the only remarkable one so far is Kirie (the one who loves pancakes). But this show is mostly about planes and dogfights, so let’s overlook the lack of character development. 
 
Overall 
 
If you are a fan of doghfights and WWII airplanes, then go for it. If not, well then try it, if you can bare with CGI characters and small/no character development you will be rewarded by amazing air battle scenes. As a someone who has dozens of hours on games like IL-2 Sturmovik or Crimson Skies, and likes WWII stuff in general, I can only say it deserves 9/10, because of the way they presented the dogfights and airplanes, which are the main aspect of the show after all.

    Now that Gundam Unicorn is over I can finally give a proper review on it. 
 
This show does not have character development,but has a good plot to make it an above average anime. 
 
Banager,the main is like Kira from gundam seed,always wanting to stop fighting and crying even when the situation does not call for it.A chosen one from the onset,he at least does have a useful role as a protector and does not have as much of the gary stu complex as much as Kria. 
 
Ther animation is awesome.the mecha fights are cool and well choreographed,and unlike anime like Madoka aren't pointless trippy rides that add nothing to the story. 
 
The show is about finding the laplace box,a treasure that could change humanity and the unicorn gundam is the key to unlocking it.It could end the war between newtypes and the normal human.I was disappointed by its reveal cause it is comething that any government with common scene could have done easily,but it did its job decently. 
 
It still has the trope of the power of understanding is a superpower that could wipe out the baddie in an instant.but at least that are meaningful protecting scenes and people butting heads unlike 00 where it was just a deus ex machina and merely saying that understanding is a magic power of everybody agreeing with each other. 
 
The dialogue can get too draggy at times,they talk about war in general which sometimes irrelevant to the situation at hand.Makes it ""deep"" though. 
 
Liked the father figure subplot . 
 
Riddee was a bad villan.he randomly helped a girl and betraying his forces like nothing and came back to the good side like nothing.No proper foreshadowing and buildup 
 
The awkward scene transistions.Zeon princess in a diner.Nuff said. 
 
At least this is one of the few series that actually deserves its ""Gundam"" title.

    I had the poor misfortune of watching Re:Zero before Steins;Gate, thinking I knew what I was in for. I was gravely mistaken.  
 
Steins;Gate goes after many different goals and achieves almost every single one flawlessly. With a large setup for an equally large punchline, I was fully invested in the characters, story, and stage till the closing curtains drew in. The greatest successes had to relate to two factors: Atmosphere and Story. 
 
Atmosphere: While I enjoyed each character as individuals, the greater contribution to this series' success is their group and couple interaction. Consistently, I had pairings I hoped would interact more often. Every time one character talked to another, the mood, the lighting, the music, and all contributions were completely set to make for enthralling dialogue and reactions. Additionally, while some of the references might seem dated now, I found myself constantly engaged in hearing them. Often this show felt like I had opened a history book of what 2010 was like. All in all, I felt dread, happiness, relief, sadness, and intrigue whenever the show writers wanted me to: right on schedule. 
 
Story: I'll admit my bias. I'm a sucker for Illuminati style intrigue. Hell, the Deus Ex series is one of my favorite video game franchises. The story regarding SERN, time-travel, the future, and the past is all my jam. This series just hit every button it was going for regarding the story. Hope, dreams, despair, and fate are all great topics that are drawn into the narrative to encourage you to keep pushing through even at your lowest points. You feel along with the protagonist, and the story's machinations are what keep you and him chugging along until the very end. 
 
This series is a complete gem of it's time. While it nearly drove me insane with grief, I'm glad to have watched it.

    A friend recommended this anime to me so I started watching it and I immediatly fell in love with this anime, I watched season 1 completely on 2 days time because it was so enjoyable. I would recommend this anime to all my friends! 
 
The characters are so lovable aswell, each and every single one of them has such a funny/amazing/cool personality. 
 
Also how the story develops is so cool and unpredictable with sometimes a humorous side  whereas it can be serious and nailbiting aswell. 
 
The opening and ending OST's are so good aswell possibly by the best OST I've ever heard!

    Slade's Quick Review 
Gangsta does the thing were you make a weak character feel bad-ass, and that is where much of the enjoyment factor comes from this show. Nicolas much like Hei (Darker than Black) and Hisoka (Hunter x Hunter) are characters that are actually not as strong as many others in the show but they create this ere about them. This is due to very good writing in the show, which shows in other areas like characters inner selves and relationships with each other. The draw back is the lack of relevant story telling, the characters just kinda do their thing and the story kinda happens slowly around them. My final complaint is that the two main characters relationship switches between I hate you and your my brother and it makes things a bit confusing after the third switch in emotions. Also the show teaches you what a jigalow is and no its not the fools with the clown makeup.

    I typically try to wait until an anime is finished to review it, recommend it, or at least a few episodes in.  I will have to say that this anime so far is promising.  It's based in a school setting where a boy wanders off into an area that is no longer used and is able to see a ghost.  At first he doesn't believe her, but as the day goes on he starts to realize that she may in fact be a ghost.  This anime looks to be a good one.  I am excited it made me laugh, and had that level of mystery that makes me want to keep coming back for me.  I cannot wait to see what else they have in store!  Will they find out how she died or who killed her?

    I've heard much about Strike Witches before I first watched it.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised by its actual depth than what common hearsay has informed me of.  Allow me to elaborate. 
 
Picking up slowly, with the introduction of the setting and characters, it eases us in to a somewhat formulaic format.  We begin with our heroine, Yoshika Miyafuji and her initial anti-war sentiment and her joining the titular organisation.  It then segues in to the exploration of the respective members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing with a Neuroi usually present to showcase the ability of that particular member.  There is a twist of course, but I leave that for you to discover on your own.  I have a particular gripe about the plot's pacing though.  It feels like the plot twist was constructed in a hurry and tacked on for the last few episodes.  All in all, not too shabby. 
 
The 501st Joint Fighter Wing is an aerial unit circa WW2 and its task is to stop Neuroi who deploy in the air.  Beautiful aerial dogfights ensue with pretty explosions and very &quot;nice views&quot;.  Many seem to discredit Strike Witches solely for the fanservice and in a sense I understand, its enough to cause a fatal nosebleed.  But that isn't the only fault it has.  Rendered English countrysides look plastic when the 501st have some field exercises.  My god do they look plastic.  Otherwise, the 3D rendered art looks detailed, especially the Japanese Carrier Akagi, the 2D backgrounds look up to snuff and the lighting is justly positioned. 
 
The sound is not spectacular though it does a good job of providing us with good audio cues.  Few parts have audio that I feel does not go with a scene.  Sound effects too sound a bit off kilter and it feels like all the guns sound the same.  Those who watch quite a lot of anime may recognise some familiar voices too but this is where your mileage may vary. 
 
At its heart, Strike Witches is the 501st's war story and in war stories, it explores the characters and their relations to each other.  Some of it feels too sudden though, such as Yoshika's sudden change of heart to enlist.  However, as the bulk of character development is on a per episode basis, we get enough of a feeling for each of the characters, showing interpersonal relationships, personalities, hopes and fears, particularly of the veterans of the conflict. 
 
This was a fun and mostly light show.  In fact, if you look past the fanservice and the initial blood loss involved, its something that could be recommended to anyone interested in magical girls or aerial combat action.  However, it was more the little parallels to our history that had me appreciating Strike Witches, especially mirroring Erich Hartmann wearing Hitler's hat with Erica Hartmann's wearing someone else's &quot;pants&quot; (they have the gall to call them pants) as a result of their stupor. As far as enjoyment goes, taking an alien threat and putting it in a WW2 era setting while replacing actual ace pilots with loli magical girls with no pants sounds like a winner to me.

    I passed over Kuromukuro quite a bit while watching other Netflix shows, I had just finished watching a really great anime and needed something to watch to pass the time. I immediately loved this anime, the story is great and original.....binged watched it for a couple days in between my husbands shows. I loved the fight scenes, they were balanced and believable. The character development was great and I ended up liking characters I hated in the beginning. The show has a lot of fun moments as well and definitely will have you laughing the your a++ off.  
 
 
 
 
 I really hope Netflix renews for a third season, they left it on such a cliff hanger and I need to know what happens! >.> I really hope to see Ken and Yukina reunite!

    I have not written a review in some time. This anime could be looked at in many ways. One of which the writer is trying to showcase the ugliness of human beings. 
 
The story line goes to three characters that are humanoid monsters. They give little explanation to where they may have come from but what they do showcase is that they would like to become human. What is human however? They go on a journey in a corrupt city that sounds similar to classism. Separation of classes.  
 
I gave the story line a 6 due to the description I gave above. It showcases the real depth of human beings and their hatred for anything unknown. That they destroy what they don't understand or fear, even when that creature is willing to risk it's life to save us.  
 
The art, like other's have mentioned, was not the best quality, but I have seen worse. It isn't my favorite art, but it does seem inconsistent at times. 
 
The characters I did enjoy. I liked how they were able to look into each of their wishes and wanted they all wanted was to truly become human. Even after they found out what being human meant they still had integrity. I enjoyed how each one was different and the relationships they attempted to form. 
 
All and all this anime is interesting and I would recommend it to those who are looking to think critically about what being human means.

    First review so don't go to hard on me if i write it bad :) 
 
I simply loved it, i watched everything of trinity seven and i didn't know there were movies yet. 
The anime ending was kinda bad since i wanted more development, the movies really gave that which satisfies me. 
 
One little thing that bothered me a bit was the sound, sometimes when there were intense scenes, you could really hear the audio getting distorted cause of how loud it was. 
 
Thats all i have to say about the movie, i really recommend this movie to everyone who has watched the anime.

    ""It's about the journey, not the destination."" 
 
This phrase is used to describe a lot of shows, movies, etc. The basic idea is that how the story shakes out in the end isn't important: the experiences gained along the way are what matter. 
 
Violet Evergarden is a tricky show to parse at first, because it's the antithesis of that idea. It relies on a slow build of character, story, and tone that might not grab you and sweep you away right off the bat. It demands the patience to sit down and follow it through to the end, trusting that the time you invest in it will pay off when all the pieces come together. Violet Evergarden is ALL about the destination. And I understand how this might put some people off it, as you don't know whether the 6.5 precious hours you spend watching it will be worth it, or just a waste of time. 
 
Well, fear not, curious one. Because having finally finished the show, I can confirm that it is absolutely worth it. 
 
Set in a fictional country that resembles Victorian England with a bit of a steampunk twist, Violet Evergarden centers around its titular hero, a 14-year old orphan girl who was taken in by the army and raised as a living weapon, a tool of death meant only to be used, pointed at the next target and told to kill. But the war is over now. There's no more fighting left to do. Major Gilbert, the one man who treated Violet as anything more than a tool, is missing, presumed dead. So where does she go from here? 
 
Well, she finds a job at the Auto Memories Doll service, a ghostwriting service that sends its ""dolls"" across the country to write letters for whomever asks for them. Why does she take this job? Because she's haunted by the last words the Major spoke to her: three words that, having been raised as an emotionless killing machine, she can't understand. By transcribing the thoughts and feelings of others onto paper, she hopes that one day, she will grow enough to understand Gilbert's last message to her. 
 
The series follows a mostly episodic format, in which Violet is called out to write for a new client every week. As expected, they all have tragic backstories or deep-seated issues, and through her interactions with them and their emotions, Violet begins her slow crawl back to humanity. Her growth serves as the throughline tying these mostly unrelated stories together, with each inch of progress she makes during one episode visible in the next. This is what I mean by the destination mattering more than the journey; on their own, these disparate stories about wounded people trying to find peace might not be all that interesting. It's only when taken as a whole- not as separate vignettes, but as one character's deeply personal journey, exploring love in all its facets and flaws- that the show begins to truly pay off. 
 
And holy SHIT, does it pay off. The waterworks may be slow to come, but once they start flowing, they don't stop. Violet's increasing awareness of her own humanity, and the pain she both feels and has caused, is utterly wrenching, and in the moments where it fully bursts out, it makes me sob more consistently than anything since Clannad After Story. Credit must be given to the criminally underrated Yui Ishikawa, who between this and Mikasa Ackerman has nailed the seemingly-emotionless-but-with-hidden-depths shtick down to a science. Yes, it may be slightly melodramatic at times, but this is anime. If I'm not watching it for huge swells of feeling and emotion, then why am I watching it at all? 
 
What helps these moments land is the fact that anime though it may be, Violet Evergarden doesn't feel like anything else on the market right now. I mean, in a medium full of giant mechas, high school, fanservice, video game worlds, and other intensely nerdy pursuits, Violet Evergarden feels like it was ripped right out of the pages of a Jane Austen novel. It's soaked in a kind of 19th-century atmosphere and feeling, defiantly refusing to pursue any of the tropes we've come to expect from anime. That kind of attitude is admirable, and it helps the series' biggest moments land with the impact that they do. 
 
Of course, special attention must be paid to the animation as well. Kyoto Animation has always been the king of good-looking shows, but this one REALLY takes the cake. Beautiful backgrounds, characters that move and shift with subtle detail, well-integrated cg, cinematic-quality editing and lighting effects, and some truly jaw-dropping rotoscoping... you could print out every single frame of this show and hang it on your wall. It adds so much wonder and beauty to a show that's all about wonder and beauty, making for a truly enthralling watch. 
 
All in all, Violet Evergarden is a true masterpiece, worthy of the hype that it's been gestating in for the past few months. If you abandoned it early on because you were worried it wasn't going anywhere, now would be the time to fix that. Because it does, indeed, go somewhere, and the destination is absolutely worth the journey.

Love knows no bounds. Yet, you must know that for it to count. That i am afraid is the problem for a couple. While one of the two looks into others craving another the other remains clueless. Adrift to her own compulsions. Unaware of her surroundings. 
 
That is why fighting for love is a must! Don't get me wrong not all battles are ripped with bloodshed and anger.Others exist in the mist. Like battles without weapons of war are found. Sure, Not like most battles they don't end smoothly. Yet, without those battles progress wouldn't have been made.  
 
Alas, enough of my wordy words to penetrate with you some of the emotion this mustered inside of me. You must see this!

    Well Clannad is one of the anime that I like.... 
But after watching clannad after story you'll definitely love it... 
If youre a guy who cries easily then prepare to cry at this story. Cause this story will give you a great impact at your heart. And you definitely want to watch more of a clannad if you watch this... 
The Art of this story is great..the scene, the story, and the characters have a great graphics... 
The sounds is great too..When It is a sad times, The music is great that the music alone will make you spaced out to think the story. And sure the Dango Daikazoku song (ending theme of clannad) will be heard since That song is nagisa's (the main heroine of this anime) favorite. 
The characters was great.... On how they react with each other... 
having each personality but still suit to make the story great. 
The enjoyment was great because it will make you enjoy since the jokeswas made is not out of time... 
Overall this story for me is 10... 
Cause this anime gives a big impact to me... 
Making me remember this anime forever...This is my favorite anime....

    Eternally selfless and loving Kyoko devoted her whole life to helping the man she loves achieve his dream of becoming a rock star. Only to one day overhear him bashing her opening admitting to using her and hitting on another woman. You know what they say,  
Hell Hath No Furry Like A Woman Scorn. Something inside her snaps (or rather opens in this case) and she is reborn a new person with an unquenchable thirst for revenge and demon minions to aid in her quest. Unable to get close enough to him to settle her vendetta Kyoko decides to enter show business so she can personally ruin his life the way her the former love of her life ruined hers. 
 
Skip beat is surprisingly mature for a Shojo, walking the fine line between love and hate with tact and realism. It takes on fairly complex subjects but does so with lightheartedness and great sense of humor. At its core, it’s your standard coming of age story about a young woman discovering who she is. And Like your traditional, shojo there is still a romantic element to the story but, in many ways, that is secondary to Kyoko’s own personal journey. The character development is what really makes this anime so great; not just the star but all the characters are fully fleshed and well rounded. From self-centered rock star who broke her hear, to her reluctant best friend, to her flamboyant/eccentric boss, to the 8 occult loving 8 year old that haunts the talent agency, to the stoic workaholic movie star who becomes her new potential love interest all the charters endearing to watch. Even the career path Kyoko chooses (which I wont name to avoid spoilers) is presented in a way that will make the audience fall in love with it as much as Kyoko does. 
 
The animation is solid with a lot of bright colors, although it does use the simplified chibiesqe character design for comedic effect occasionally. 
The music is nothing to write home about; its neither impressive nor annoying, it simply serves as ambience. 
As far as I know its only available in subs but the Japanese voice acting is great and there is an outstanding fan sub on youtube (just the first episode, sorry) that I invite anyone to check out.

    Zeta is my second Gundam series after having completed 00 like a year ago, I must say that overall, the series is very good. One of the things that interested me the most was to compare the 1980s version of the ""Gundam future"" with the one we see in 00 and I have to say I'm very pleased. I was expecting something very old-school like the old Star Trek series but was met by excellent mecha and spaceships design, as well as the overall universe the story takes place in. 
 
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam is a sequel to the first series from 1979 and tells us the story of Kamille Bidan, a Newtype soldier fighting for the AEUG against the corrupt and evil Titans. Among the important characters are allies Emma, Captain Bright, Fa, Four Murasame and of course, Quattro AKA Char Aznable. Antagonists Bask, Jerid, Yazan, Paptimus Scirocco and many others also make appearances during the entire series and make for intense and awesome fights all around the 50 episodes. 
 
I'm not an expert when it comes to animation and sound but I honestly liked the style in Zeta Gundam. As I mentioned, I was expecting something similar to the old Star Trek TV shows but was surprised by the designs of some of the mobile suits which look much better than mechas from modern shows. I loved the Zeta Gundam, Palace Athene, The O, Baund Doc, etc. Don't underestimate this series for having been created in the 80s, it's as good as anything from 2000+. 
 
But while mostly good, I have to say that many parts in the middle are slow-paced and a bit boring. Some of them even feel like filler. A lot of episodes feature what seems to be random, pointless fights between the AEUG and Titans and sometimes, it's tricky to keep track of what's going on because the storytelling isn't the best. But the beginning is very intense and interesting, just like the ending (my God, that ending). And don't get me wrong, the middle is extremely important and has a lot of excellent parts too. 
 
With that said, I come to the conclusion that this is in fact an awesome anime and I'm very happy that I watched it, now in 2013-14. Together with 00, Zeta Gundam makes me an even more hardcore Gundam fan and I'll keep watching the rest of the series. The animation, design, soundtrack, fights and story are very good. 100% recommended.

    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW INCLUDING THE ""END OF EVANGELION"" MOVIE** 
 
""Neon Genesis Evangelion: The most influential anime of the 90's, and arguably of all time. This anime entirely changed the rules regarding what an animated series could convey and how it could convey it. Virtually every anime released after 1995 draws at least some inspiration from NGE, meaning that the anime industry itself would not be what it is today without the not-so-simple simple  tale of a quiet boy named Shinji Ikari."" 
-A synopsis of what everybody says about Neon Genesis Evangelion 
 
Wow. With a reputation like that, I really had no idea how to feel when I started watching NGE.  I wanted to feel excited, but I didn't want to get my hopes up only to be disappointed; after all, there are many people who absolutely despise this anime and consider it to be vastly overrated. NGE is one of those shows that you either love or you hate, and I was unsure about what category I would fall into. 
 
Well, after watching the series, watching the ""End of Evangelion"" movie that concludes the storyline, deeply contemplating it, rewatching several parts of several episodes to try to make sense of the complex plot, analyzing the behavior of the characters, and further researching several things I didn't understand , I think I finally have grasped the series well enough to write a review on it. 
 
Basically, NGE is simply unlike any anime you have ever seen before, and you will never see another anime that parallels it. It is incredibly complex and very difficult to understand, but if you do understand it, you will view anime differently for the rest of your life and you might even learn something about yourself. It is certainly not without flaws, but NGE is a must watch for anime fans aged 17+ who are mature enough to handle its content. 
 
Plot: 8/10 
When watching the first few episodes of NGE, it's hard to understand what all the commotion is about. It comes across as a relatively generic installment to the already stereotype-heavy mecha genre. It isn't until the show starts hinting that there is some kind of conspiracy going on that things start to get weird. Then it gets weirder, and weirder, and weirder, until finally, all hell breaks loose. Actually, that is an understatement; things get absolutely INSANE by the end of NGE, and no matter how many times you hit the pause button to collect your thoughts and try to figure out what the hell is happening, you still probably won't get it. Understanding the plot of the show requires you to think very hard, rewatch episodes, and research certain aspects of it on the internet. This, of course, is the reason this is a love-it or hate-it anime: people who hate it despise the ""wild goose chase"" that the plot sends you on. I don't deny that NGE goes around its elbow to get to its thumb, but when you finally realize what is going on, you start to develop an appreciation for it's intricacy. 
 
NGE does not tell its story in the traditional fashion because it is not a traditional anime; in fact, NGE draws more similarities to literature then it does to anime. This is because NGE is an allegory; just about everything in it stands for something much, much more significant then it's face value. The show explains very little and most of what we know about the plot comes from subtle hints and personal interpretations rather then proper explanations. If all of this sounds like way too much to think about, NGE is likely not for you, because this anime is more then just a piece of entertainment; it is a journey into the human phycology. NGE made me contemplate things that I've never contemplated before, and I legitimately think I learned a few things about myself by watching it. I also loved the ending and thought it was a perfect way to end the series, but that is just my own personal interpretation as I know that many people did not like it. 
 
So why only 8/10? Because NGE simply does not provide explanations or meanings to EVERYTHING it throws at you. There are still several things about the plot that could have been handled better and there are still minor plot points that are so ambiguous that even trying to loosely interpret them is a shot in the dark. Ultimately, certain aspects of the show simply feel unfinished due to the well documented financial problems that NGE experienced towards the end. Despite this, NGE's story is a powerful and very enjoyable experience. 
 
Art: 7/10 
While the animation was outstanding for its time, it is beginning to show its age. However, that doesn't bother me much because some of  the scenes that are being animated are so awe-inspiring and thought provoking that it doesn't have to be recent to be good. The animation style becomes more and more shocking as the show goes on 
 
Sound: 8/10 
An interesting and largely indescribable choice of music, in my opinion. I thought it fit well with the tone of the show though, and lets not forget that NGE's OP is arguably the most influential OP of all time; it set the new standard of what a show's opening theme should be and what it should accomplish, and that deserves tremendous amounts of credit. 
 
Characters: 10/10 
In an industry that is (and was) overpopulated by characters with no flaws who are based on the aspirations of the audience (such as being a lady's man or a total badass) like Kirito from Sword Art Online or Shirou from Fate/Stay Night, NGE opts instead to write it's characters based on the realizations of the audience. 
All of the characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion are symbols for the insecurities that all of us have deep within us and for the methods we use to cope with those insecurities. Specifically, NGE's characters all have a deep rooted hatred for themselves; they all feel that they are unworthy of any sort of love or acceptance, but all of them cope with this insecurity in a different way. This is especially the case with the protagonist, Shinji, whose flaws we are able to recognize in ourselves so easily, allowing the meaning of the show to really get across. By basing the characters of the show on actual human emotions/flaws and executing the portrayal of those emotions/flaws to perfection, NGE has arguably the most realistic and relatable cast of characters in anime history.   
The symbolism of the characters (which I won't discuss in great detail) flies over the head of a lot of people because Shinji is the only character that has his insecurities specifically stated. It is not clear until much later in the series that the other characters have very similar problems that Shinji does. For example, Asuka appears on the outside as the complete opposite of Shinji; she is extremely confident, outspoken, and self-assured to contrast with Shinji's shyness, quietness, and self-hatred. As the show goes on, however, it becomes increasingly apparent that Asuka isn't exactly as comfortable with herself as she acts (that is quite the understatement). I don't want to spoil anything, but watching all the characters slowly  spiral downward until they hit their breaking point is very fascinating, incredibly thought provoking, and most notably: applicable to real life.  
The characters in NGE aren't great for the reasons that characters in other anime are great; they are great because the viewer can relate to all of them in a way that makes him/her question their own life; there is a piece of Shinji in all of us, a piece of Rei in all of us, and a piece of Asuka in all of us. Their quest to obtain inner piece is portrayed so passionately and convincingly that it holds the audience's attention through thick and thin.  
Coping with loneliness and self-hatred is something that we all have to go through, and NGE's characters provide the perfect vessels to raise the questions that NGE was intending to raise, and I give the show a tremendous amount of respect for that. Masterfully written characters. 
 
Overall: 8.5/10 
Neon Genesis Evangelion is NOT your average anime; it cannot be watched in the same way that you would watch other shows. If you not prepared to think extremely hard and put forth a significant amount of time into watching , rewatching, and analyzing the show, then I recommend you steer clear. This anime is an allegorical, symbolic journey more then it is a television show, and people who don't understand that are going to hate it. NGE stands as the pinnacle of psychological anime after completely destroying the previously perceived limitations of the industry. However, perhaps NGE's greatest accomplishment is that it made us think about our own lives and problems in ways we never had before, and that is outstandingly hard to do even for something that isn't so seemingly simple as anime.

    I have not seen a show like this in a long while. That's not to say it's good, mind you. I came away from [i]Gantz[/i] with mixed feelings that ultimately ended in dislike. The show follows a perverted, angry-at-the-world teenager who sees an old friend at a train station. They both witness a homeless man fall onto the tracks, and the friend jumps onto the tracks to save him, then yelling for his friend to help. For no good reason that I can figure out (unless it's peer-pressure), the cynic jumps onto the track to help. They save the old man, but are killed by a train, and transported to an apartment, where others who have just died seem to be gathered. 
 
I don't want to say more about the plot, but I do like the ideas behind it. The story told in [i]Gantz[/i] is interesting enough that it kept me watching it all the way through. I wanted to know what was going to happen next, especially in the latter four episodes or so. However, the ending left me very unsatisfied, and made no sense at all. I came away from the story ultimately with a sense of pointlessness. 
 
Of course, it doesn't help the show's case that the main character is utterly unlikeable, for me at least. He almost comes off as believable, but is taken too far to really be a believable character. 
 
The same rings true for most of the characters. They're presented as these people in this alternate Earth, but then taken just a little too far in their archetypes to be believable. This isn't necessarily a problem for most of the characters, except the one or two that just become annoying. 
 
This problem is compounded by the art design for [i]Gantz[/i]. Everything is drawn quasi-realistically, but retains enough of the fact that it's an anime that, again, it just becomes a little annoying, rather than giving the impression that I'm sure the people behind this show wanted it to. 
 
Voice acting for the series is, overall, decent. My only real problem with the voices was casting for certain characters, especially a major character, who ended up sounding weird at times. The VA work wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either. 
 
My biggest problem with the show has to be the pacing. For the first few episodes, things go along somewhat slowly, but any time it comes to a scene where the characters disagree about something, they stand around for twenty minutes talking in circles about it. Everything seems like it's taking way too long, to the point where it became a game to guess what would happen episodes in advance, which isn't a fun game, because the answer is always, ""They're gonna talk about it for two episodes, and then they'll actually do [spoiler]."" 
 
But not only does it move really slowly, but any time stuff does start to happen, the viewer is constantly assaulted by the gory deaths of characters that I guess we're supposed to care about, but I didn't, and by scenes that almost make this show hentai, if not for the rest of the plot. 
 
That's pretty much [i]Gantz[/i] in a nutshell; nothing happens, then gore, then sexual scene, then nothing for a while, then a lot of talking in circles, more gore, and more nothing. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone. [i]Gantz[/i] is not worth spending the ten or so hours to watch the entire series. I give it a one out of five, because the only redeeming quality for the show was the interesting premise.

    Britt: Disappointment. What more can I say, other than ""dis-a-ppoint-ment""? It was just....it was so bad! This show had so much potential, and that potential was WASTED here! Seriously, what the hell?? God. I guess I should actually review the freaking anime before I start ranting on and on about how I didn't like it. As usual, we're going to start with the story. The mess of a story here I might add. 
 
Story: (Copied from ""My Anime List"") 
""Long ago, all humans lived beneath the sea. However, some people preferred the surface and abandoned living underwater permanently. As a consequence, they were stripped of their god-given protection called ""Ena"" which allowed them to breathe underwater. Over time, the rift between the denizens of the sea and of the surface widened, although contact between the two peoples still existed. 
 
Nagi no Asukara follows the story of Hikari Sakishima and Manaka Mukaido, along with their childhood friends Chisaki Hiradaira and Kaname Isaki, who are forced to leave the sea and attend a school on the surface. There, the group also meets Tsumugu Kihara, a fellow student and fisherman who loves the sea. 
 
Hikari and his friends' lives are bound to change as they have to deal with the deep-seated hatred and discrimination between the people of sea and of the surface, the storms in their personal lives, as well as an impending tempest which may spell doom for all who dwell on the surface."" 
 
Let me point out all the problems I see here: What exactly does it mean by ""some people preferred the surface and abandoned living underwater permanently""? Is it like a ""Little Mermaid"" scenario where they just said ""forget my family and friends! I'm going to abandon them to live up on land with strangers!"" or some crap like that? And how were people born in the sea when they could just so easily live on land where there's honestly more to do there anyway? Is this a religious thing? Like how at the beginning of the worlds creation there was nothing but water? Is that the direction they were taking with this? They could've also been a little more specific with it. Like, I wouldn't have minded knowing who actually decided living on land was better than living in the ocean, and if the anime could explain their reasoning. That brings me to another problem I have here. Why are the sea dwellers and land walkers racist towards each other? No seriously, why? They're almost the exact same! Only difference between them is some people have blue eyes/eyelashes and live in the sea. That's literally the only difference. They both have school, they both eat and cook the same, they both read the same, sleep the same, open pickle jars the same, live in the same type of houses, they even have FIRE and STARES underwater, so what the hell is the difference between them? They hate each other for NO. FREAKING. REASON. Is this just a way to create some forced drama and conflict? Because it didn't work. Their ways of living are too similar to even say this is a real issue between them. Shioshishio is the underwater village, while Oshiooshi is the land peoples village. The creators were even lazy enough to make their village names damn near anagrams of each other! It's just a case of people bullying one another for no reason whatsoever. That's all. Also, the world-building wasn't good. Like. Seriously bad here. The little bit of the oceanic world we got to see was beautiful, but are you actually expecting me to believe that there's only ONE village in the ENTIRE ocean? I don't understand why we couldn't explore it a bit more. And why is it that Hikari and his 3 friends were the only children in their entire village who had to be sent to land school? Heck, they're the only children ever SEEN from their village! You absolutely cannot tell me with a straight fact that that little village takes up the entire. ocean. Why aren't there any other villages? And their middle school was the only one they had so they had to go to land middle school and they're the only middle schoolers living in Shioshishio? That's freaking retarded. And for the limited amount of ""plot"" they actually had, it was glossed over to make room for contrived romance. Which I'll get more onto in a second. Seriously, who wrote the script for this mess of a plot? (Mari Okada) Okay. Yup. That makes sense now. 
The story gets a  4/10 for me. 
 
Characters: 
Wanna know what's worse than the story of this anime? The freaking characters, that's what! Most of them were unlikable and most of their decisions were stupid and unbelievable. I can easily sum up the main 4 in one word: Hikari-->tsundere, Manaka-->crybaby, Chisaki-->b*tch, and Kaname-->bland. The other characters aren't good, either. Tsumugu is almost exactly like Kaname, except he shows even LESS emotion than him, and the most reaction we ever see from him is probably in episode 14 or 26. Miuna is a bit difficult to describe in a nice way. She just seemed to be there just cause she can be, until the last episode where they made her more relevant than I thought possible. Same with her best friend, Sayu. Akari is Hikari's older sister, who was best friends with Miuna's mother, but then her mother died, and Akari and Miuna's dad started dating....Which I find...not right, for lack of a better word. I don't want to imagine it this way, but it felt like she was just waiting for Miuna's mom to be out of the picture so she could be with her dad. They even have a kid together and Miuna starts calling her mom, and it feels like NOBODY saw anything wrong with this. I know this most likely was NOT the intention, but it certainly felt that way. And I guess since the same thing basically happened in RWBY, it's just considered ""normal"" *shudders*. Really, the main issue I have with the characters is that they all seem to be in love with each other for whatever reason, they're indecisive as hell (and you should all know how I feel about that from my Vampire Knight review), and they cry too damn much. Think Lucy from Fairy Tail and Dawn from Pokemon cry a lot? Well you ain't seen nothing yet! They cry way too much for me to even feel sympathy for them. Most of the time, their tears are unnecessary, and are only there for forced drama. I also bet you're wondering why I said they fall in love too easily and they're very indecisive, huh? Well even if you weren't wondering, I'm gonna explain it anyway! You've heard of love triangles right? Heck, you've probably heard of love polygons too, haven't ya? Well, have you ever heard of love ""squiggly lines"" before?? Well if that's what you've been after, look no further cause this anime has got that squiggly line for you! Let's put this in a way you'll perhaps understand: Hikari likes Manaka, but it seems Manaka might have slight feelings for Tsumugu, but it's later revealed that she actually likes Hikari. Chisaki also likes Hikari, but didn't tell him because she knew he liked Manaka. Kaname likes Chisaki as well which he randomly told her out of the blue because he showed NO signs of actually liking her in that way beforehand, but it seems Chisaki may have started developing feelings for Tsumugu as well despite acting like she hated him earlier on. Tsumugu likes Chisaki back, but it's so hard to tell with this guy since he's like stale bread who spouts words of wisdom every now and then, but has the personality of a rock. Miuna ALSO likes Hikari, and this is probably the strangest one considering logically Hikari is her uncle now, since his older sister married her dad (that's creepy as hell.) Miuna's 3 year old brother has a 3 year old crush on Manaka, random boy A likes Miuna, and random girl B likes Kaname, the lamp post loves the stop sign, the garbage can loves the bucket of water, and lastly, Sayu likes Kaname, and it felt like he was playing with her emotions when she told him. Did you get all of that? Need a diagram for this crap don'cha? I also find them indecisive because they hardly EVER make up their minds about something. This is mostly for Manaka and Chisaki, ESPECIALLY Chisaki. The reason I called her a b*tch at first is because that was pretty much her whole character. She acted sweet and innocent, but for some reason started hating on Manaka because the guy she likes is in love with her...? Excuse me, but how is that Manaka's fault? She never forced or even TOLD Hikari to like her, he decided that on his own! Manaka even tried to hook the two of them up, yet Chisaki was STILL being salty! Are you jealous because he likes someone else? Is that your problem?? And I'm sorry, but she basically hated Tsumugu's guts earlier on in the series, but as time went on, it felt like she developed feelings for him and started living with him, but was still in love with Hikari at the same time. I should also mention that in episode 13 when Tsumugu fell off the boat into the ocean, she screamed his name in terror and worry, despite telling him to ""shut his mouth because he doesn't know squat or understand what she's going through"" a few hours, maybe even a day before. She also let Kaname fall into the ocean right after saving Tsumugu, and you can just see the jealousy in his eyes as he falls into the water staring and her. I mean, she might've only saved Tsumugu because he's a regular human being who would've drowned had she not saved him (at least, that's how it was in the beginning. He and Miuna get plot armor later on in the series), but the way she screamed his name made it seem as though she loved him. And in episode 17, you can just feel the envy flowing through Kaname's veins as he watches Chisaki getting along with Hikari and Tsumugu (and what even is episode 19...?). Kaname might as well have been added to her list of guys that she's trying to pick but can't decide on which one. Manaka was a bit indecisive too because she couldn't choose between Hikari and Tsumugu, but it became clear who she really wanted and was just in denial like everyone else. While that situation was annoying in itself, at least she wasn't on Chisaki's level of annoyance (and Manaka actually became a better character when the Sea God took her ability to love). Really the only person I gave a crap about was Lord Uroko (or if you wanna be a weeb, Uroko-Sama.) He was the only one who was actually likable in my eyes, plus he's cute as heck (CUTE=SMEXY). I honestly would've preferred watching him the entire time than watch the other characters being stupid and annoying. It's sad we don't go into his backstory till later on in the series. 
The characters get a 3.5/10. 
 
Art/Sound: 
Here comes literally the ONLY good thing about this anime aside from Lord Uroko! I thought the art was beautiful, and while most people will consider the music to be dull and generic, I honestly loved it as well. I enjoyed the soft sounds playing in the background, and I actually reeeeeally like the first opening: ""Soshite Bokura Wa"" by Ray, and the first ending: ""Aqua Terrarium"", by Nagi Yanagi. Loved them enough to get the full songs onto my MP3 player. And The first OP sounded like a Vocaloid was singing it, and I love Vocaloid so...ya know. The second OP and ED were good, too, but if I had to choose, it'd be the first ones instead, cause I don't recall ever skipping them, and if I did it was probably only once or twice. I thought the sounds of the ocean were well done and realistic sounding, and I watched the anime dubbed. Think the voice actors did a really great job here. They really made Hikari sound like a tsundere, Manaka sound like a crybaby, Chisaki sound like a b*tch, and Kaname sound bland. So, props to them. The ocean was very pretty, especially when the sun was rising or setting on it (just wish it could've been explored more.) And despite not liking the characters, I thought their designs were very pretty. At least, the people from Shioshishio. The people up on land were boringly colored and designed, along with their village, so the ocean was the best. All in all, this was definitely the best part of the series, and I wish everything else was just as good. 
Give the art and the sound both an 8/10. 
 
Overall Enjoyment: 
I did not enjoy this series. Come on at me with your pitchforks and whatnot, but I just...did not like it. The best thing about it was the art and music, and art and music isn't enough to save a series from being bad (Looking at you, SAO.) I don't think this series needed 26 episodes either, as it seems most of their conflicts could've been solved in less time than that had the characters just talked to each other. I went into this show expecting to love it, and I was disappointed with it. The thing with the Sea God (that I kinda forgot to mention during the story part) was also pretty stupid. His reasoning's for wanting to freeze over the land killing off the land people and then putting all the ocean people into hibernation because he was lonely and wanted a girlfriend was petty to the extreme. And then suddenly letting land people breath underwater even though normal humans shouldn't be able to (logically) because REASONS was poor. Very poor. Hikari even called it ""childish"". Why were they suddenly able to breath underwater when the show specifically stated beforehand that they would not be able to do that even if someone in their family was from Shioshishio? And why did Manaka lose her ""Ena"" and then gained it again when Miuna grabbed her freaking arm? And don't even get me started on the magical, voodoo, ""ryu ga waga teki wa kurau"" crap that happened in episode 26. There was too much damn plot armor. The series could've been better, and I wish it would've lived up to the hype (still looking at you, SAO.) The characters were all whiny, indecisive, and annoying for the most part. Only ones who flat out spoke their minds were Kaname and Tsumugu, and Tsumugu is (as I mentioned earlier) like a rock. 
I give the final score of: 6/10. 
 
Sorry if you enjoyed the show, but it just wasn't for me. It made me laugh a few times, and Lord Uroko will forever be bae, otherwise I didn't really like it.

    Is This a Zombie? is an anime I seen pop up on Netflix and I'm glad to say that I gave it a watch! It reminded me of so many different shows such as ""My Bride's A Mermaid"", ""B Gata H Kei"", and ""Heaven's Lost Property"". This is not to say this anime doesn't have a charm of it's own. I went into this show with not knowing what I was getting into really because I had heard nothing about it. Not gonna lie, the 1st episode was a bit over the top for me at first, but you get adjusted to it shortly after. I believe the reason I liked this show so much was because of the expectations I had when I began to watch it. The thing is, I had none! So I was thoroughly surprised when certain scenes occurred. This anime is to never to be taken seriously, if you take it seriously you lose the whole point of the show, which is to entertain you rather than to tell some complex story with plot twists up the ass. Now let's get into the sections of the show and what I liked and disliked. (I haven't watched the OVAs and the 2nd season at the time I'm writing this review) 
 
Story: 8 
The show's story is a extremely weird but I LOVED IT. It's all about a boy who's name is Ayumu who was tragically killed by a serial killer and is brought back to ""life"" by a Necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe (Eu). Eu is the most powerful magical being in the world, but having all that power comes at a cost. After this encounter with Eu, Ayumu's life will never be the same. He then becomes friends with a Magical Garment Girl and a Vampire Ninja. Story sounds pretty crazy right? It only gets crazier as the story progresses. It was pretty unique and different in my eyes, so I enjoyed a lot. 
 
Art:8 
I'm not very good when it comes to determining how Art is, compared to other anime and what not. But I enjoyed the art style for what it was. The colors really gave the show a nice feeling to it because they would always match depending on the scenario. Never seen any flaws with it in my eyes. 
 
Sound: 7 
To be completely honest, I don't remember hearing anything really memorable from the show. Which is a good and a bad thing. Its a good thing because it shows I found nothing wrong with the sound itself, but it didn't stand out much. So it was ok, the only song I remember was that blasted Ending. It was AMAZING, I almost always watched it whenever it came around. I honestly got giddy when it came to the end of episode so I could hear it again. The animation that goes with the ending also added to my enjoyment to it. 
 
Characters: 8 
The characters were both the one of the greatest things about the show and one of the downfalls of it as well. If you're not closely watching the show and just enjoying it for what it is, you'll find the 95% of the the characters are likeable and funny in their own ways. The situations they get themselves in are pretty hilarious as well. But when I took a better look at them, most of them are just one dimensional, there are a few exceptions mind you, but again MOST OF THEM are. Characters won't be much of a problem if you don't this anime seriously though. Most of them are all zany, even if they don't show it at first. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
This is easily one of the funniest anime I've seen in a while. From the parodying of clichés, to the overall humor this anime provides, it's just a riot. Some people may find some of the rehashed jokes some characters use to be annoying but, I didn't mind them one bit. Another thing people may have a problem with is when this show is trying to be serious. This anime has the tendency to have a serious moment, have some humor and then a serious moment again. This may cause viewers to have a disconnect with serious moments. BUT, as I said before, this show is just for enjoyment. So if you don't take it seriously, you'll actually find some of the serious moments to be funny in itself. Some moments just didn't make sense even when I replayed over several times, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment 
 
Overall: 8.5-9 
This show was something I didn't imagine I'd like very much, contrary to this, halfway through the 1st episode is where I just fell in love with it. As I've stated several times in this review, if you take this show seriously you're not going to enjoy it much. If you turn your brain off for the 12 episodes this show has, you'll most likely enjoy it very much. Even when you turn your brain off, you may notice some things in the show that don't seem right, but you'll get over it no time. 
 
P.S. In my opinion, I loved when this show showcased the different parodies of popular things that happen in other genres of anime and just of clichés in general. I would be bursting out with laughter XD 
 
P.P.S. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE OVAS AND SEASON TWO!

    Well what do you have to say about that movie? Holy fucking shit. That was just great, just fucking amazingly great. The cinematography was interesting and on point. The cinematic techniques of choice were critically creative and different. They put animation over intricate art design, or simply using a very interesting choice of art style from mediocre to substantially alluring artwork. And we finally get to see some semantic puns dude lmao. We finally get to see some witty dialogue from the original serie's style of attracting people to watch the anime, for its essence of a great dialogic attraction and ornate philosophical writing. And em catch phrase is back too doe lul. And em pedophile is back too, aka Araragi, giving loli em perverted looks kappa. And i just cant get over the fact that Hanekawa boob physic is so perplexing to comprehend, like how in the hell is it that big, and why does it moves like a water balloon? It was a weird but the way they blend those in with the story makes it ok tbh. Because the entire film was unearthly weird in a good way. In addition to that, the mix of classical, piano, violin, female vocals singing melodies and some nostalgic melody that was played in the background really gives you that vibe that you're not actually watching an anime right now, but you're actually watching a western like film with a greatly lip sync japanese dub. Given the fact that each character movement and animation are so much different from the entirety of the possible japanese animated film and anime that I have seen thus far, and there are even some ballet and shit too. Though even if that were the vibe that I was getting from this film, the level of creativity and the weird mix that may not be that funny to some, despite it aiming to be darkly humorous and really just a weird blend and mix, it's all in all a very experimental way of doing a movie within such a style. The art also have a mix of random scratches of characters or drawings, real life picture photoshoped or being displayed in the movie, random sounds of baby crying as a metaphor, and so on. The multiplicity of these weird and innovative, or even experimental even, is by far one of the most interesting thing that an anime film has to offer. And all in all, that was some great movie quality production there shaft. Even though it took you like forever to create one of these great movie and all the movie parts. PS, the movie was also randomly kinky, seductive, and INSANELY CUTE AS FUCK as fuck. OMG SHINOBU AND HANEKAWA WHY ARE YOU SO FUCKING CUTETETETE..... Anyways, given that there are some butt shot and panty shot and all lol. IM not complaining, but as i have repeated through out, this was weird as hell, though i incredibly like the movie so much for its creativity and amalgamation with various sorts of visual style and presentation, presented in the movie. 
 
All the superficial side apart, imma just randomly go into the semantics now. Dramaturgy (sociology) sociological perspective in a theater like social interaction, or acting in a movie, or precisely, a story performance. This shit basically compare real life to drama in term of human behaviours, in a metaphorical sense of that real life situation in a certain scenario of the performance obviously. Incidentally, this also means "" 
the theory and practice of dramatic composition."". And I personally feel like Dramaturgy, the guy that Araragi is going to fight from what you've seen in the trailer of him screaming and all, is the exact opposite of Dramaturgy. Usually the word Dramaturgy have to do with dramaturgical analysis, but specifically the actor themselves. The audience will view the actor as he or she wants to be viewed. And if he is a dramatic character, we would expect a much more dramatic personality and such. But in term of what actually went down in the story, we got an unexpected outcome where I wouldn't want to spoil it, but it was the opposite of us viewing Dramaturgy as some kind of a tough guy with a very fearless personality, despite his power, strong walking posture and superficial looks. That was my thought this character specifically. 
 
Plus, the doki doki moment between Hanekawa and Araragi made me want to ask, like why the hell aren't they together already in the beginning of Bakemonogatari, or Nekomonogatari. I know that Araragi is in love with Hanekawa, but Senjougahara ended up on his side before Hanekawa got the chance to. But I wish it was Hanekawa that Araragi hook up, or go out with. And now I also know why Hanekawa turn into a Black Hanekawa due to the stresses that has been build up eversince Araragi got hook up with Senjougahara. The person you fall in love was taken by someone else. And that love for Araragi was insanely strong too because of what went down in Kizumonogatari. But really, Hanekawa in Kizumonogatari is so different from the normal Hanekawa in the series. I guess we will have to see the changes in her character development that helps explains her sudden change from this cheerful teaser, to that of a more well manner character and less of a poseur when it comes to trying to make us center our eyes on her boobs all the time (It was effective when she look up at Araragi by lowering her back, and look at him in a cute way) . 
 
And the film spend more time on action over dialogue in the middle of the fight, which is pretty much something that we should be expecting in any fight scene man. Literally, this anime also did something pretty experimental even in fight scene as well. You will know what i meant if you actually watch the movie (that just came out in kissanime) where a typical fighting scene being done in a humorous way (sometimes with dark humor), rather than it being extremely serious and Araragi fighting for his life. And omfg dude, the gore in this is insane. Definitely not recommended for a weak willed people, who still have that pussy like mentality that can't handle the sight of the inside of a human body. When Araragi is actually serious, he's so damn powerful too dude, I didn't expected that from Araragi, the man who never fight back, and is generally a brave, but a more cowardly person when it comes to fighting against other oddities, or oddities hunter. Ton of shit went down in this movie that's all I have to say unlike the previous one, which is obviously the exposition and half of the rising action of the overall story. 
 
Lastly, this movie is pretty entertaining to watch that's all I've got to say. Definitely check the movie out even if you're not a fan of this series. Watching this rather than watching the anime series first isn't the wrong choice. This movie, in chronological order, is the initial turn of event that make up the other monogatari series, since it's in fact the beginning of its entirety.

    Welcome to the NHK - a profound, interesting, and sometimes painful journey taken with main character Satou Tatsuhiro. The story revolves around the peaks and the pits of Satou's life, the hardships and the anxiety, but also the mystery and optimism the the great unknown - also known as ""the real world"".  
 
Satou's character is pretty atypical in the realm of anime. Yes, he's an lonely outcast like many protags, but he is different: no matter how many times he tries to get up, he falls back down. He shows a lot of real, human characteristics that everyone can relate to in this sense. Life isn't just a  24 episode anime where your life suddenly turns for the better around episode 6. No, Satou is a complete fuck up, and when we think he's going to change his hikikomori ways, he always goes back to his same habits. This is an utterly frustrating cycle that keeps the viewer interested in his story, which comes from some really great development.  
 
Naturally, Satou had the most development of all, but it ended up taking anyway from the supporting characters. I was wanting to see more of the supporting characters' backstories, their own tragedies and struggles, and how the person they've become has gone on to impact Satou's development. Additionally, since one of the genres is ""Psychological"", I was hoping to see some more... you know, existentialist, thought-provoking dialogues and some more raw emotion or something. However, a lot of that had to come from you, the viewer, to see the meaning in the small change in characters and events.  
 
But the seemingly trivial experience of this NEET still leaves an impact. This is a story of finding friends, finding purpose, and finding hope in a life that is filled with dead ends. The real humanity found in these characters mirrors what we see in ourselves and those who have trouble supporting us, and those we wish could be by our side. In Satou's realizations, his breakdowns and delusions, you can't help but feel a little less alone in a world so overwhelmingly large.  
 
Good sound and animation, though nothing outstanding. A raw, thought-provoking narrative that is definitely worth watching.

    Gotta be the worst part of the entire Monogatari series so far, but that was to be expected since it's a miniseries of short 12-minute episodes and all but two of them are completely irrelevant to the main story. More character interactions with good jokes and thought-provoking puzzles are always good, but some of them have very underwhelming endings. The final two episodes, though? They are very important to the main story and feel almost out-of-place, though I guess technically they are also thought-provoking puzzles as well.  
 
This miniseries, since it was released online, has a noticeably lower budget; its OPs reuse songs from previous story arcs and slightly-remixed animation, and the soundtrack seems to include no new tracks. However, the animation and direction are still up to SHAFT's high standards (well high for the BD release) and won't disappoint. 
 
Obviously, it's a must-watch if you are going through the various Monogatari series and miniseries and movies, but go in expecting some pleasant filler, because that's what you're going to get.

    This won't be much of a review actualy. After watching this anime however you cannot simply walk away without a word. 
 
I mean how on Earth it is possible that such a amazing piece didnt receive any continuations of the story.  
Full Metal Panic first sezon was great really unique, but then Second raid is improving upon it twofolds. It is amazing in story art and characters. You can see how much efforty was put into it and it ends in a way that begs for continuation, with second raid only prepering the stage for future content. 
 
There are lots of series  spread thin in action, without any substancial story, with plot going on in circles, yet they span for several seasons. And when there is finally some increadible series packed with action, with great evolving story it gets cut short in place where evrything begun to really shine. 
 
It might be one of the worst diapointments for me in Anime. 
 
Sure we can still hope someone will sometime pick up on this old series but it wont be the same it could have been.  
Still Full Metal Panic remains an unforgetable experinence. With Second Raid beeing an example how should sequels be made.

The story was excellent. The main characters were quickly introduced, and the action, a.k.a the problem, was shown very early in the anime. The plot was very gripping, with lots of fan service. But I personally think it was too much because they tried to add it in any way possible, especially during the action sequences. The horror part of the anime might be quite scary to a young viewer, but it adds in to the story. You see some characters die off quickly (FYI not a spoiler because I don't say who, and it happens right in the beginning) and it was very good to watch as the group of high school kids had to fight right at the beginning. It was a very action oriented anime, so there was rarely a dull moment. 
 
The art was great. I really liked how they drew each individual character, as well as the zombies. Each character had their art style, making it more easy to remember their faces, as well as their own ""trademark"" such as a sword, a gun, a spear, glasses, and so on. The artists also drew guns very well. The guns were drawn well in SAO, but HOTD drew them more realistically and it felt more real because there was a huge recoil when the characters shot them, unlike when guns were shot in GGO. Anything found in real life was drawn exceptionally well, such as helicopters, motorcycles, and bridges. In the action scenes, the artwork was clear and sharp. It is high quality animation. 
 
The opening is quite good, and they change the ending song very often. The opening is filled with vivid colors and the synchronization of the pictures/frames were timed really well. It starts off slow, but then increases its speed, while giving plenty of fan service. For the ending, it was just a bulletin board filled with pictures of the characters enjoying themselves. It was a good moment to unwind with because the songs were usually more mellow. It can be a bad thing, though, because after an action filled episode, when it suddenly goes to a mellow song, it can kind of ruin the mood. However, the graphics were great, with the creators changing the first photo depending on where the characters were, or where the story has ended. 
 
The character development starts immediately, with them changing from average high school kids to zombie killers in a matter of episodes. They also reveal parts of their past as well as their parents' occupations and in Hirano's case, his grandparents as well (which incorporated some good comedy). I enjoyed watching the characters split up every once in a while, as well, because it reveals more and more about them. My only complaint about them was that 4 out of the 6 were really annoying. Hirano and Saeko were really good characters, but Takashi was, in my opinion, useless and was just there to give a decent pep talk. The nurse, just, *sighs and face palms* she doesn't heal anyone from what I've seen, so she's pretty damn useless. There's Takagi, who has such a bad personality that I want her to be eaten by ""them"" And Rei...she just needs a man but she's really needy. I'm not a fan of those. 
 
I quite enjoyed it. I was reluctant at first because I'm not a big fan of female fan service (I'm a girl) but I really enjoyed watching it. The action scenes were fast paced, some lives were lost, noble moments, and vulgar moments, it all came together into a great action and horror anime.

    Gallery Fake is a a perfect example of the seinen genre.  It is sophisticated, realistic, and logical . . . and yes, it does have its light hearted moments.  Each episode features a ""mystery of the week"" but what sets it apart and makes it so intriguing for me is an amazingly accurate look at the intricate workings of the art world.  I have a deep love of Art History and this series touches on one great master in many episodes.  It also explores other things that are art as well; things like antique watches, photo-journalism, and Pre-Columbian civilization and artifacts.  It is very much like the live BBC series Lovejoy, a long running story about a brilliant but slightly shady antiques dealer. 
 
It is not surprising that because the series is about art, the look of the anime itself is top notch and I love the sound track, especially the opening song.  Awesome, upbeat jazz with a vintage feel. 
 
If you are looking for something different, give this one a try. 
 
I have to agree with the previous reviewer and give it an overall it gets a 10.

    After finishing this series, there is a bittersweet feeling of emptiness welling up inside me. I yearned for more K-On!! which led me to follow up on their stories in K-On!! high school and college mangas respectively, which are decent and close on a high note just like the anime. 
 
Each of the girls has her own unique personality which is endearing to the audience. Everything about them and their interactions with one another just clicks together. The awesome storyline, soundtracks and artwork complement one another to create a one of a kind masterpiece. 
 
This is perhaps one of the finest SOL/MOE shows to have existed which set the standard for similar types of shows to follow.

    Kiznaiver is, unfortunately, as almost everyone says; rushed and badly written. Trigger took on way more and grander of a concept than they could eventually deliver. 
 
It looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous, and the first half felt seriously promising with its intrigue, but in the end it goes nowhere and ends with what has to be one of the most terrible anticlimaxes I've ever experienced. 
It really feels like they ran badly out of time and had to deliver something that they have to know is totally lackluster. 
 
Apart from the huge letdown of an ending, the writing fails in other interesting ways as well. The side characters look awesome and get at least some personal development during the series, while the two _main characters_ on the other hand both look and sound uninspired and unlikeable. 
The further I watched, the less I could find myself giving a shit about the only two characters whose stories really SHOULD have mattered by the end. 
There's also a noticeable amount of really jarring retconning where they pull unexpected new information and characters out of their ass and just expect you to care without any set-up. Nuh uh. 
 
TL;DR 
Art and sound: stunning 
Characters: nice designs, bad development, incredibly dull and unlikeable MC+""villain"" 
Story: is all over the place and would've needed much, much more fleshing out and airtime to be good. 
 
Cannot recommend this one, which is a shame.

    It took everything I had not to drop this terrible piece of work. At first glance I saw a reverse harem (which I personally enjoy) that was beautifully drawn (another enjoyment) that also just so happened to include a supernatural element (so much potential enjoyment). I read the description and proceeded to watch the first episode. It was awful. The characters were rubbing off as abusive weirdos and I forced myself to continue cause I thought there might be an okay story line and was hopeful that the characters would develop into something better along the line. I was wrong. 
 
~No enjoyment whatsoever. I'd have to be paid to watch this anime again. 
~There was barely a story line and what of it only came around towards the end of the anime- In which I had already wasted my time in watching. It was weak and didn't leave an impression.   
~The art was lovely. I really enjoyed it. Pity it was wasted on such a terrible show. 
~The sound was decent. It did sound sort of... vampiric. 
~The characters were awful. If you're into S&M (Sadism/Masochism) than you'll probably like the way they all treated each other and reacted. Yui was a girl with no backbone and not a single intelligent thought in her brain and the brothers were all terrible to her. They didn't like her to any extent as you would expect from a supposed romance anime. They lusted after her and her blood but in such a way where it wasn't even attractive. Just.. creepy.

    We’ve all gone through a certain point in our lives where we just want to feel less lonely even though our abilities for social interactions are limited for some inexplicable reason. Shows that remind us of those dark times can be polarizing for the majority to comprehend and because of this we don’t see many shows try to tackle the subject. The reason being the fact that most people don’t like to revisit what made them so miserable for so long. Luckily for some of us, we always look back at those moments and laugh at how silly it was and thanks to the show Watamote we can now have a show that does that for us. 
 
Based on the gag manga, Watamote is set as your typical slice of life show, only this time they added some new twists into the mix that make it a little more fresh than others; dark demented twists so to speak. It is dark in its subject matter but at the same time it has a comedic overtone that compliment each other very well. You have Tomoko’s wild intentions on wanting to be popular yet is unable to due to her supreme lack of social skill and the fact that she has been somewhat of a hikikomori for the majority of her life. The camera angles that constantly pans to her face that often looks distorted from the style of animation it tries to exacerbate really give you a sense of dread and anguish for her yet at the same time you can’t help but laugh at her expense. The show also goes into parody territory by showcasing your typical awkward moment of conversation such as picking up a dropped pencil from a classmate sitting next to you and so forth. This is done with some clever flashback sequences that show us Kuroko’s comprehensive mindset. 
 
Sporadic and chaotic are the two words that sum up the humor of Watamote. This is a blessing and a curse to the show as a whole, in which the humor in this show is very unpredictable and goes to new levels of hilarity as time goes on but at the same time it can get quite repetitive quickly. Repetitive in the sense that Kuroko’s constant ramblings and random noises she makes when she goes insane are done too frequently and mostly comes across as tedious than charming after a while. What does save the humor is the actual build-up of the most funniest bits that feel very fresh and unexpected to see thanks to the well-thought out dialogue that is written in those scenes; scenes that involve Tomoko and her mother in her room as her audio recording of a male seiyuu is played in the background and joining a couple of boys peek into a love motel. 
 
One other small aspect that I truly admire about the comedy is the chemistry between Tomoko and her brother Kuroki and their hilarious dialogue exchanges to one another. Whenever the both of them are on-screen together, you get the actual feeling that this is how most siblings treat each other on a daily basis; they don’t necessarily like each other when they are in their personal space but they’re nonetheless bound by blood and can’t help but feel for each others troubles. It’s a shame they don’t have enough screen-time together, that way we could see some growth between them but what we have here at this point is enough for me. 
 
To start out with characters, Tomoko is the type of person you either grew up knowing someone like her or you grew up as her, but for the most part we’ve all been the latter. We’ve all just wanted to try to put up an act of ourselves to make us seem edgy or cool but end up failing miserably as a result. Tomoko herself is the main driving point in the show who performs her antics with pure charm and sympathy, thanks in part to her voice actress Izumi Kitta who is extraordinary playing as her. Her ability to create Kuroko’s personality is almost inhuman in a good way, though there are some times where she performs her job too well to the point where it sounds like she’s going to pass out near the end of the take. 
 
That doesn’t mean that the other characters share the same kind of memorability or charisma as Kuroko does, with the exception of her brother of course. Her best friend Yuu Naruse, played by Kana Hanazawa, is a pretty bland childhood friend type of character who isn’t given much to her performance other than to show more of Kuroko’s despair. Now one way to defend this is by looking at it as the fact that Kuroko is the only character that is the center focus of the entire show. The rest of the characters don’t even have to be fully developed because all we are focusing is on the main character Kuroko alone. It gives off the same loneliness feeling that she is going through to let the audience feel the same thing to make us feel contempt for her sorrow. Then again that’s what makes the comedy all the more meaningful and hilarious. 
 
That isn’t to say the comedy is always perfect by any means. There are times where we’re taken into situations that go a little too far and the comedic timing doesn’t even provide any humorous feedback because of how poorly handled they are. Not that they were anything life-altering disturbing but it’s one of those moments where you raise your one eyebrow and feel uncomfortable at the same time. While there are some hiccups here and there, the writing does jump back into the swing of things and provide endless over-the-top humor that is both dark and clever. The numerous parodies to other anime are a definite plus as well. 
 
What better way to start out your typical slice of life show when you could just provide a loud bombastic metal song into it to make it edgy?  No doubt the opening might alienate people since obviously it feels out-of-place by the fact that the scenes being shown in the opening have absolutely nothing to do with the show. I would argue that it’s heavily symbolic as if we’re in Kuroko’s own subconscious thought in how her thought-process is majority of the time and for that it’s a pretty decent opening. The rest of the music is here is fun and nice to listen to, even though it will eventually be forgotten in about two years time. 
 
It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that the show is very demented to watch and might leave people with a really sick feeling in their stomach, but it’s something that anyone shouldn’t pass off if they are a big fan of dark comedy and a parodied look into the otaku lifestyle. It can be a tedious ride if you can’t handle the repetitive nature of Kuroko’s random ramblings but there’s always that one moment that makes the ride worth it to go through. A moment that makes you have tears roll down your eyes from sheer laughter and going absolutely nuts by how bold the humor can be observed as uncomfortable. After all, we need more admirable shows like Watamote that isn’t afraid to go too far with its jokes.

    'This world is full of absurdities as a matter of course, if you have the time to be resentful and resign to that, have fun fighting those absurdities instead.' 
 
Ansatsu Kyoushitsu... I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into when I started watching it. Thanks to Koro sensei, I found myself learning together with 3E, bit by bit. 
 
I've always regarded myself as a 'good' student, good grades, rule-abiding, close relationships with classmates, not getting into any trouble. And even though I was vaguely aware of how those typically labelled as 'bad' students or delinquents had their own troubles, I've never actually made myself to consciously think about it. Upon entering university recently I started becoming a volunteer tutor for children not doing that well, and that's kind of where I started to really want to understand them and their backgrounds. There are just things that we are vaguely conscious of, but never being aware enough to act upon, and taking lessons with Koro sensei gave me insight into what I could do, not only as a tutor, but also as a person constantly learning through life. This is one of the things I loved about watching this anime (along with the magnificent ending episodes, and Koro sensei himself). Three terms with Koro sensei and 3E felt like a fruitful journey by the end, with so many of his ideals and beliefs that I can revisit upon. 
 
The story and the beliefs, those are the two main things that I think were done really well in this series. With other aspects however I wasn't really that impressed, one of them being the characters. While Koro sensei was a fantastic character through and through, loved Karma (though this is probably mostly because he's so sassy), Nagisa was mediocre as the MC and fell flat for me, and plenty of other character developments and introductions felt forced and didn't seem to be well thought out. It felt like things just happened (unnaturally) because of plot necessity, to add a bit of spice, to try and bring things to a full circle, to try and connect all the characters in one big picture. Character-wise, this season was relatively weak, and this affected my level of enjoyment as well, especially from around episode 15, with the exceptions of the last couple of episodes, which were brilliant of course. Art and sound, nothing outstanding, but sufficient. 
 
That said, I definitely like this series, and I gained a lot from it. It had a great premise, but could use better execution.

    Where to begin with this, shall we say ""unique"" anime.... 
***SPOILER ALERT READ WITH CAUTION***** 
Alright I guess i'll start with the first category Story: 
So before I write anything let me say that I write this review in the context of what this anime is supposed to be, a lighthearted/comical story filled with ecchi scenes, big breasts galore and wacky storylines and events/logics.  This being said I still have to give the story an abyssmal rating of 3.  Why 3 you ask because 3 represents poor and that is the first word that comes into my head about this anime's story.  So we start off simple enough with our soon to be MC just tryna peep on other women, we very quickly find out he loves big breasts and then we have our female lead show up and basically be the same generic hot/shy girl that makes most viewers gag.  Things don't really go up from there but as lenient as I can be in many respects on an ecchi anime like this, I can't excuse the sheer lack of time and effort put into the story.  In the simplest terms as i can use, the story is basically this:  Male protag meets female protag, both end up as ""co-pilots"" for a giant fighting robot that gets stronger based on how charged the male protag is on erotic things/thoughts (i.e groping the female protag) they fight bad guys, bad guys lose and come back stronger, both sides trade advantages over next few episodes with the ""antagonist"" introduced after the first ""battle"".  Main protag ""dies"" and female protag gets knocked out.  Insert swerve sound here and bam now we follow a whole new female protag and new male protag, repeat events of first protag couple until penultimate battle where main protag couple comes back, two couples team up to fight bad guys.  Bad guys become good guys and government becomes the new bad guys.  At the end everyone says sorry, former bad guys go away happily ever after and good guys are at peace the end.  Did that sound boring and generic to you?  Good now you know how i feel.   
 
Art: 8 
Alright so we all know this is an ecchi we watched the anime for fanservice and some humor that much is understood.  That being said the art in this anime is actually pretty nice IF we're talking solely about the chracters.  By this I mean each alluring woman offered as fanservice is very well modeled and on the whole they all very appealing and good fanservice.  Personal favorite of course has to be Kyoko just because her look in general was great with close seconds being Chieko and Moriko.  Of particular note is details given to Ritz's eyes, and the various energy based attacks---they were all exceptional as well.  The backgrounds did the job well and the robots were passable albeit very clunky in design.  I suppose that was the intention here so in that light I'll give the art in this anime a very decent score, my only regret is kiriko and shouma had to take over for a few episode because they aren't as good as Kouichi and Kyoko. 
 
Sound:  So this review might be a bit lacking, I just don't pay too much attention to sound when I watch an ecchi.  Yeah the voice acting was okay/good and most other action sounds were generally good too, I just never was ""wow'd"" by the sound in this anime so i'll give it a neutral score. 
 
Chracter: 6 
I can't even stand that i score it that high to be honest.  Basically everyone from the Prince organization---I hate their characters so damn generic.  Kyoko is the biggest albeit prettiest offender as she's just the usual big boobed tsundere type that eventually likes Kouichi's shall we say attention.  Kiriko and shouma are no better albeit Shouma's ""gulliver"" was funny the first time he did it.  Chiezo made a good slutty teacher character (and again looked very nice).  The only reason i give this anime a 6 is because of Ritz and the penguiin empire.  I have to say the idea of crazed human sympathizer isn't revolutionary but man Ritz's way of doing it was just great.  Always referring to herself in 2nd person, always having that constant level of charm in both anger and happiness, her character was refreshing.  But the best part had to be the penguins I mean just look at them.  They're humanoid black and white things with giant dick-like tails.  The very concept is so odd that its actually funny.  Pair these two with the ""emepeor"" penguin who tries his hardest to be serious and we have some decent characters in an otherwise bleak environment.   
 
Enjoyment:  9 
WAIT WHY THE HELL DO YOU GIVE IT A 9 IF YOU HATE THE STORY AND CHARACTERS?   
well that's easy, because the anime succeeding in being entertaining despite its flaws.  As much as the story and some characters made me cringe, the little things like the general populace fearing the good guys in fights, or the two leaders who try way too hard to be serious made me laugh.  Not to mention that fanservice was generally well done here.  I mean lets face it Kyoko was hot and Chieko is the kind of teacher you'd want to give in to.  Put all this with an MC who is just too eager to follow up and we have genuine humor.  I also give the enjoyment a slight bump up because I'm a massive mecha fan even if this one doesn't make the best use out of them.   
 
 
Overall:  6 
yeah if i'm gonna actually give a serious opinion on ""would i reccomend this anime"" then I'd have to say no to most people.  To other ecchi loving, wacky loving fans like myself I'd say yes go watch it.  But to a general fan of anime I'd say no don't waste your time, too many problems too few good points.  So if you fit that first category of viewers then Hell yeah go watch this anime.  But if you're the more casual or serious viewer then stay away.

    After watching both seasons of New Game I thoroughly enjoyed the series, however the 2nd season didn't quite match the enjoyment I felt while watching the first season.  
 
It is important to note that this is mainly because of the addition of the 2 new characters; Momiji Mochizuki and Tsubame Narumi. Throughout New Game!! I found the majority of the cast from the first season far more interesting and fun to watch than those two in particular. The second season also felt more story-driven. By this I am not referring to a more serious tone, but rather a direction outside of office itself.  
 
On a disappointing note this season didn't produce as many high points and memorable moments as the first season did, but it is still enjoyable overall. On a positive note this change in direction allowed the friendships of some characters to further develop.  
 
I have no clue whether a 3rd season is in the cards, but if it is I eagerly anticipate its release.

    Edit after episode 13: I cried big wet tears at the excellent storytelling and well placed character development. SUCH. BIG. TEARS. 
 
I was skeptical as hell for the return of the Gintama anime. To be honest, I went into this anime wanting to slam it as hard as possible, especially upon seeing it's overbearingly high-score. But I won't, because to be frank, I can't. 
 
I don't really think a lot of reviews, complex and heavily-illustrated need to be written about this anime to get a feel for what it's about so let me get straight to the point: It's ridiculous over-the-top comedy, plain and simple. Of course you can't forget the awesome stories built from these insane gags, too. 
 
The scripting, the scenario, specifically the way that the anime envelops you inside - making you a returning character as well, are all ingeniously meshed together. 
 
And of course, after five years... brought to you in 16:9 format. 
 
...With even better songs than ever (hard to believe, I know). 
 
If you haven't seen Gintama before, I recommend checking it out, and I know 201 episodes sounds like a grueling task, but after seeing the pilot episode for the second series, I was left more than satisfied. This episode is reason alone to watch the over two-hundred preceding it. 
 
Even if you're familiar with Gintama and think you're ready for Gintama', let me be the first to tell you; you aren't. 
 
Note: I don't believe this review needs to be edited every week, as most episodes are either episodic or self-contained within an arc. If you've braved the first 201 episodes, don't miss season two.

    Love can come in many forms. It can hurt, destroy, build up relationships, and share desires. Love is a beautiful thing, but sometimes behind that beauty lurks darkness, despair, loneliness.  
 
I will be reviewing Kuzu no Honkai or Scum’s wish as a Manga reader. Hope you enjoy. 
(Possible Spoilers) 
 
In many anime’s lies a relationship between two people that seem to always work, relationships that are happy, flawless, and beautiful. It always seems to work the way it’s supposed to. It is the depiction of what you would call a perfect love story. However, in this anime lies a relationship that…well…works in a sense. Just not what would be the usual idea of a “perfect relationship.” 
 
The story revolves around your not-so-typical relationship between the two main characters. Them being Hana and Mugi. They are characters that love someone else. For instance, Hana loves Narumi, a “brother” figure that’s been there for Hana ever since childhood. Because Narumi was there when she wanted him to be there, she basically gained feelings for him. On the other side we have Mugi, who loves Akane, a tutor that was with him for some time. As you all know, they’re both teachers in the same school. However because Mugi and Hana are not able to gain those they cherish, they now have to fill the void inside their hearts and “love” each other as substitutes. While of course, not loving each other like they do with their significant others. 
 
“You can have everything…but my feelings.” 
 
Basically “You can do anything you want to me, but I still won’t love you.” 
 
Men lust, I have lusted as well. I’m sure many others have as well. Because Mugi is a man, he has that sexual drive with Hana, that certain desire that makes him want her more and more. Hana accepts his desires, willingly.  
 
This anime…has characters. They are characters that probably won’t be on your favourites list. 
 
These characters suck, they’re personalities drive you up a wall. However, it’s as real as you can get. These are characters you see in the real world. I’ve even seen them before.  
 
You may hate these characters, you may want to kill these characters, just remember that they exist. 
 
I mean especially Mugi. He’s a man, just your regular human being right? Even though he knows everything about his love, Akane, he got lost in the sea of pleasure. Even though she’s broken, deceiving, disgusting, and downright narcissistic, he still desires her, he still wants her body. 
 
People’s words sometimes never matches the actions they portray. Mugi knows, but his actions represent someone who lost to lust and desire.  
 
 
So I’m glad the writer decided to make an oddly accurate representation of what we see in reality. The types of messed up relationships we see, the types of desires they have, the kinds of sides they hide. The kinds of situations they have. It exists. It’s just this anime decided to dive deep and show us what happens in these types of relationships.  
 
But in this anime, love is twisted in a way where it just get glares and disgust looks from people. 
 
However the characters are a reason I see a lot that people decide to hate on this show. Which, in a sense I can understand. Maybe they’re not used to seeing these types of characters, but that’s just an assumption. 
 
But I like to see something different, something that you wouldn't usually see in anime. Scummy and crappy characters, hence the title. The depth and emotion these characters share to each other gives a solid picture of light and darkness. At first, things may be just jolly well, but then boom. Reality hits. 
 
See, the thing is, you can see this as mature or non-mature. I don’t see how people see this as just a crappy fan service series, when cleary it’s not. You either conclude this as hentai or not hentai.  
 
I don’t mind mature subjects, nor mature scenes. Because I find it interesting. The environment they create and the uneasy atmosphere is definitely what makes me hooked unto the show. I love it. Way more than I should. It’s such a dark atmosphere, I wouldn't blame anyone who hates this show. 
 
Speaking of hate, It’s already obvious that this show will not be for everyone. But I have to disagree with people stating that this show doesn't represent real love or that this show is unrealistic or that it’s just for fan service purposes. But let’s remember that they’re human beings like us. I know I say that a lot but I can’t stress it enough. 
 
Characters in the anime do what people do in actuality. 
-People lust 
-People make mistakes 
-People have desires for other people 
-People act recklessly 
-People love to toy with others 
-People have sides they don't show to others 
-People want sex 
-People have dark emotions 
-People have bad thoughts 
-People have evil intentions. 
-People steal 
 
The list that I just stated were characters that exist in this anime and real life. Because it’s a real thing. So I disagree with those who think this is unrealistic and just for fanservice.  
 
The thing is, Kuzu no Honkai represents visually what some anime’s do not. A messed up relationship with the crappiest characters you can think of. Scummy characters, selfish characters, lustful characters, evil characters, lesbian characters I guess. Or just a lesbian character.  
This story represents what would happen if you would put these types of characters into one anime series. I can tell you one thing: It ain’t pretty. But if you’re into this type of thing like I am, go for it. Just know that each character have sides they don't show to others. When those sides show, you see them in a new light. 
 
But before I go into the animation, let’s talk about sex…I know… 
 
Sex for me is something I see as beautiful, where a husband and wife advance to one of the biggest steps of their relationship. To devote themselves to each other. They join and connect as one, to make a child. It’s a very pretty thing in all honesty. 
 
Now depending on the morals you have you might be someone who waits until marriage or one who has done pre marital sex before (Basically sex before marriage). As for me, I would prefer waiting on having sex until I have my future wife. I mean, I would love that. Staying pure until that time comes is the side I decide to go on. 
 
Now I never said I hate pre marital, and I won’t bash anyone who’s done it before. I mean, it can be a sensitive topic to discuss about. I mean in this anime there are sex scenes between our characters. 
 
To be honest here if you think about it, lot’s of time people have sex are for reasons, no matter how big or small they may be. 
 
I personally don't think sex is meaningless. I mean look at our characters. They do it because they desire eachother, or that they want to fill their loneliness, and needs a partner to give them what they want. 
 
Hana has Mugi, they have sex because they are alone and need each other to fill that gap. 
 
Akane has a a certain dark side to her. She loves toying with the emotions of men. That is why she has sex. 
 
Narumi desires Akane, even though he doesn't seem like that kind of person. That is why he has sex. 
 
Ecchan loves Hana, she wants her all to herself. That is why she has sex. 
 
Moca loves Mugi because they were childhood friends. She now wanted to touch him and advance. That is why she has sex. 
 
See, most reasons can all go back to the reason of desiring another individual. I see where the people come from when they say it’s meaningless. That they just do it because they want to. I mean that in itself might as well be another reason. Just because you want to do it. Small as a reason it may be, it’s still something. 
 
So let’s talk about the art, the animation, the sound, and the show overall. 
 
The art is great, it is pretty much faithful to the manga and the colours used are splendid. The animation is great and the use of the moving manga panels definitely gives it a better atmosphere. As colourful as it looks, darkness for sure lurks inside. It ain’t nice looking. 
 
When we take all these characteristics together we get an imperfect series with bad characters. They’re scum, and they’re meant to be like that. They were made in such a way that they would reflect what we would see in the real world and how the characters portray real people with these existing desires and emotion. 
 
We can all at least agree that this series is screwed up. It’ll make people uncomfortable and make they urk at this series. But for me, it’s a good kind of screwed up.  
 
The soundtracks for this series goes beyond human comprehension. The music sets the tone, the emotion, and the overall atmosphere for each scene. It’s done in such a fluid and solid way to make you enticed and hooked. The opening song and the opening animations are like pieces in a puzzle, fitting together. The imagery and little details that are in the OP makes me smile with joy. Same with the ending (Loving that Sayuri god sauce) 
 
Overall, this is a masterpiece in my book. The realistic character interaction, the realistic situations, the realistic representations, the visuals, and the soundtracks. It’s one of those rare gems you don't see in most anime’s. I’m glad the adaption was satisfactory and I’m glad this was adapted in the first place. 
 
Of course this anime won’t fit everyone’s taste. People can absolutely love it, or absolutely despise it. 
 
The thing is my standards for anime aren't that high. I’m not a huge anime critic and I don't try to analyze every single aspect and detail of an anime so I can find ways to rant about it. Nope, I don't have a crazy rubric on what’s a masterpiece and what’s not. If you see how I rate a 10 on anime, it’s either I enjoyed it to the fullest, or that it hit me on a personal level.  
 
Well for this anime, it was kind of both… 
 
While it has brought out my full attention, enjoyment, and satisfaction. It has also hit home in some parts. 
 
Seeing some of the characters in there did remind me of friends I had that were like that. It did make me contemplate about life. It made me cherish my friends again, because the ones I had before were just like Hana or Mugi. I don't see them again however, but It reminded me of them. It kind of hit home yunno? So that’s a reason why I gave this anime a 10. The way it hit me personally and the way the sexual subjects are visually represented were so realistically…real that it made me have a happy feeling inside. 
 
This anime has a lot of controversies, and it doesn't feel like a one-sided argument. It is one or the other. Bad, or good? Masterpiece? Or Atrocious? Positive? Or Negative? 
 
Mixed feelings for this show aren't unusual. Even though I loved every aspect of this show, the feelings I had for it were mixed. I mean for a controversial series, it’s only natural. 
 
But the anime’s representation on love isn't far off from modern society and their representation of love. But like I said, it varies. Once you love someone, it has to be them, as stated by Hana herself.  
 
Unrequited love, one of the types that can be hated by many people. What Sanae had to go through was rough, since she loved a girl. Eventually, Sanae had to let her go. It was hard to depart from someone she cherished oh so dearly, but it had to be done. 
 
People can choose who they love. Some guys love guys and some girls love girls. It happens, and to be honest I don’t really agree with the gay and the lesbians, but that by no means do I have anything against them. So don't get me wrong, I don't hate gays nor lesbians, I just don't agree with them too much. So no hate pls ;3; 
 
Overall, like I said, it’s controversial… You can hate it or you can love it. 
 
I guess it’s about how you see it.

    So, basically Go-Toubun again?  Sounds good to me... 
 
We Can't Study is... well, it's hardly original, we can say that much.  Those who followed Winter 2019's Go-Toubun no Hanayome will find the premise eerily familiar - although in truth neither manga is 'ripping off' the other, as they started serialisation at pretty much the same time and the authors are known to be friends.  Despite the surface similarities, however, BokuBen takes itself in much more of a lighthearted direction, with the focus on comedy, character gags and unlikely conicidences rather than Go-Toubun's heavy character drama... 
 
...which meant this was always going to have to do a lot of work to distinguish itself from any of the other gag-driven harem rom-coms out there.  Did it succeed?  Well, kinda sorta.  The show's not doing anything new, and anyone who's ever seen... erm, anything at all before will be able to predict the story beats as they happen.  You could almost tick off the story devices on a sheet of harem comedy bingo. 
 
But, despite that, it executes on these well.  The characters are familiar - but charming and with a spark of life that endears them to us.  The jokes are classic - but they land with superb comic timing, leaving us laughing along rather than at the show.  The romance is by-the-numbers - but hey, if it ain't broke don't fix it, right? 
 
So just a basic harem comedy that pulls off the basics well, with nothing to stand out?  No, not that either.  BokuBen has one massive advantage over its competitors - and I'm not talking about the show's loyal manga fanbase. 
 
The sound design on this show is, quite honestly, incredible.  I've never seen - sorry, never heard - anything like it.  Once you notice it, it's impossible not to keep on noticing and appreciating how much work has been put in.  The soundtrack is part of it, with a dizzying array of background tracks all used to their fullest extent to enhance a mood or cut out to emphasise a point.  The voice acting is part of it, with strong performances all round and incredible direction making the most of the VAs' talents. 
 
But it's most noticable in the sound effects, where the attention to detail is like nothing else.  When two characters fall into a pool, there's two splashes.  When one character is in wooden sandals and the other is in sneakers, we hear both the clop of wood and the squeak of rubber.  When someone twists their ankle, there's a crunch that makes you wince in sympathy. 
 
I'd have followed - and liked - this show just based on the strength of its manga, and I'd have been pleasantly surprised with the adaptation based on the visuals and direction.  But the sound design has raised BokuBen into my AOTS, and an unexpected delight every Saturday.  I'll be keeping a lookout for sound director Motoyama Satoshi's next work - my hat off to him and his team. 
 
Ufotable and KyoAni shows may be a feast for the eyes, but if you want a treat for the ears, give BokuBen a go.

    I watched this a few months ago and I really quite enjoyed it. Some of the themes in it are probably uncomfortable for a lot of people and so I understand why a lot of people would dislike it. However I feel the show's strong point is making you consider your own beliefs on controversial themes, the Sora arc definitely doesn't come as a shock after watching the first few episodes. The topic of incest is really controversial because no one can clearly state on a case by case incident what the right answer is, because of this it's really interesting to see how the other characters react to this and how the twins react to it themselves. 
 
Obviously the incest section is only the final part of the show and the rest of the anime has some really good character and well-placed drama so if you wished you could just skip the Sora arc and still enjoy the show. 
 
Overall I enjoyed it because it gives you a chance to see things through a different perspective and how different things can look in different circumstances. Overall I give the show a strong 7/10

    I finished this anime mainly out of curiosity. 
The art was impressive and caught my attention. And the line-up of the voice actors was also intriguing- a reason on its own to be excited about this anime. But somehow this anime fell short of what could have been one of my favs.  
 
So, how..? The story has a clear direction and the characters are all strong. There's plenty of action - all the Circus members are agile, and Gareki's skills to create bombs and to use a gun is also believable for an orphan. The art is brilliant - literally, one of the most colorful anime out there, from the costumes to the background. The sound is also excellent - the music enhances each scene, and the voice actors all did a great job (even though I hoped for slightly more from Mamoru Miyano since I admire his work). Normally with all this mentioned, I'd be continuing on raving about this anime at this point. However, the story lacked in depth, and more than anything, the characters lacked development.  
 
The story is pretty easy to understand; there's the good guys (Circus) and the bad guys (Kafka/Varuga), and then there's Nai who's searching Karoku, with the help of Gareki. The pace of the story bothered me the more I think back, how it kept on jumping from scene to scene, and the focus kept shifting from one character to the next. It also seemed as if the emotional side of the anime ie. Gareki's past was at times too forced, and therefore lost the effect.  
 
The characters started strong, and then they pretty much stayed the same. Gareki stayed stubborn, Nai was just a strange creature with heightened sense of hearing, Hirato was always cool, Tsukumo was quiet and hard to grasp, and Karoku was a mystery til the end. The only character that had a slight development was Nagi, but that was more of a discovery of his dark side, not so much a change in him that was caused by an affect.  
 
So with all the potential this anime had, it really is unfortunate that the outcome is less than satisfactory. It shows how important it is to build the characters so that you could really connect with them, and also to build a story that draws you closer to the characters. In a way I think that due to the art and sound I had higher expectations getting into this anime. And I continued to watch, curious to find out whether it would meet the level of my expectations.  
 
If I were to recommend this at all, it would be to those few who are looking for a short series that is filled with detail in art and sound. Enough said.

    Don't be fooled by Escaflowne's fantasy setting 
Escaflowne is about Love, against fate 
 
that is all, if you think this show is about anymore than that, then you're wrong 
 
True it has its moments when the plot seems to intensify or when you (hope) for a character development that will really change the (gooey) romantic mode, but in the end it is rather disappointing to the fantasy genre as a whole 
 
The soundtracks are good, the battle scenes could have been better, and it could have benefited the series if fighting was really a bit more implemented, and that is why 
 
Escaflowne is for those of you who think that Love and romance is a major theme in anime and who are willing to actually enjoy it (which unfortunately I didn't)

    This easily ranks top 5 shows for me. It’s an interesting concept where society has become so advanced that crime and other aspects of life are judged with the Sibyl system. It’s a smart story, with multiple commentaries about human nature, law/order, and crime. The antagonist is not your standard one, and is rather highly intelligent and charismatic. The cliff hangers never leave you hanging like some bad one night stand. If it’s based on concept, then this would get a solid 10. However, there are some not so great things about Psycho-Pass. Though this is a crime fiction, you don’t get any cool analyses of crime scenes like typical police genres. Even the pace of the chasing scenes are pretty slow in comparison. The characters didn’t resonant as real people, and I was very aware they were the embodiment of the different perspectives for the writer’s social commentary. It’s still an interesting watch nonetheless, but definitely a dialogue-driven show.

    I didn't watch the Evangelion anime before starting the movie. Its kind of old and I assumed just watching the movies is good enough for me. The story is interesting and a cool take on mecha anime. The art and sound are good enough to make the show presentable but nothing too special. 
 
 The main problem I have with the show is the horrible main protagonist. All he ever did in this whole film is whine and complain on literally anything and everything. Any conversation he has with other characters, anything he dose, anything he thinks about, nothing but whining and complaining comes out. It really enraged me and made it difficult to connect to the characters of the show. Despite that, its a great film and I wouldn't dissuade anyone from seeing it. Just beware of the terrible protagonist. Hopefully he gets better in the next film.

    Kimi no Na Wa is currently my favourite anime. I have seen A LOT of anime (Even though my profile may not show a lot on anime. Dont worry, Im slowy going through the lists) and I tend to be quite picky with them. If there are small things, I tend to take it out of proportion. Kimi no Na Wa tells a supernatural, romantic story about two high schoolers who meet through a very strange way. From here on, a beautiful and sad story is told. 
 
Story: 
The story itself is easily a 10/10. The way Matoko Shinkai progresses the story allows all the viewers to understand it. There have been some movies that are pretty hard to understand; they confuse you but Kimi no Na Wa was clear, understandable and purely beautiful. Movies, well for the most part, contain cliffhangers that make the viewer imagine what happens to the characters once the credits roll, or perhaps even have endings that completely disppoint the viewers. I dont want to spoil anything but I will hoever say this. Kimi no Na Wa has one the best endings I have ever seen. I remember when I saw the numbers of the movie time reaching the end, I was panicking becuase at the point I was at, I thought ""I swear to God, if this movie ends just like 'that' Im going to absolutely lose it!"". Kimi no Na Wa did not end terribly rather, it was beautiful and I couldnt have asked Matoto Shinkai to end it any better than that. 
 
Art: 
Matoko Shinkai has been known for his work to has stunning art. Some of his works off the top of my head are 'A Garden of Words"" and '5 Centimeters Per Second'. These had amazing art and Kimi no Na Wa, I can tell you did not disppoint. The art was too good. I found myself having to rewatch scenes because I was too immersed in the art that I missed what the Characters were saying. The scenes were so smooth. This 'unreal' art is nothing like real life (Well obviously) but what I mean is that Matoko Shinkai took unreal to another level. The shadows and lighting was at a glance, unreal but it just did stick that it was unreal. This doesnt really make sense but it was so unreal that it was so real, if you get the gist of what I mean. 
 
Sound: 
The sound was great.In the opening of the movie, one of the main characters, Mitsuha was doing a bit of a voice-over. The sound of her voice was 'resonating' in my ears (Though this may just be the work of my godly headphones). Needless to say, there were no cracks or errors that ruined the experience of the anime. Now I  saved the best for last. The soundtrack. The soundtrack was produced by RADWIMPS, a Japanese rock band. The soundstrack was absolutely stunning. I really likeed how the main focus of the music was slow and (somewhat) sad music. One of my favourite songs, Katware Doki was just so good that the next day I went ahead and learnt it on the piano. Others like Yumetorou and Zen Zen Zense are more upbeat; rock. Audio queues that led the music into the movie were pretty amazing. Im not expert on rating music but this is truely what I think. 
 
Character: 
Character was the only section in which I didnt rate it a 10 (xD). This was because at some points I found myself disliking Taki. He was a pretty stubborn(ish) characters and I didnt mind that at all, just some points he got on my nerves. That was really the only thing that I found negative so it's all downhill from here. All the rest of the characters, and I mean all, were very well designed. I kinda felt that there wasnt much of a variation in the personalities because every one just seemed so nice. Mitsuha and her town, they were all bright characters. So why did they deserve what happened to them? Back to Taki. I loved the way that the progression of his character led. He cam from this somewhat stubborn character to this outgoing guy who changed his emotions towards one person to someone else. Character development is one of the, or if not the most important aspect of an anime and Kimi no Na Wa managed this with amazing ability. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I recall the first time viewing this movie. It was during one of the holidays of my college year, one of the holidays that I had to study for my mock exams. The night that I watched Kimi no Na Wa, i completely forgot about my upcoming (mock) exams and all the stress and anxiousness flowed out of me and I was immersed in this space where I had not worries. That was pretty cheesy but that is truely how I felt at the time. Kimi no Na Wa combines humor, the supernatural, romance and mystery in 1 hour and 50 minutes and was very well executed as well. I loved watching this movie and I cant tell how many more times I will re-watch it. 
 
Overall: 
Overall this movie deserves a 10/10. I can not stress how much this movie deserves even more praise (Even though its the #1 anime on AML at the moment). Every once and awhile an absolute gem comes out of Japan and the buzz around it is just amazing. I love to hear how this movie practically came out of nowhere and it just blew everyone away on how good it was. Im gonna be honest, the first time I watched this I was stunned. I thought that this would be another movie that wouldnt be EXTREMELY popular but the next month I had a look on MAL's ranking and what do you know. This masterpiece was the #1 highest ranked anime. Needless to say, if you havent watched Kimi no Na Wa yet, what are you still doing here?

    Success stories have always had a spirit that the Academy and many others have deemed inextinguishable. The soul and passion of the fight to victory has always had an undeniable effect on us humans, who have always had the hidden spirit of desire; the very desire to go the extra mile and make it to the top. And it is in these stories where we see this undeniable burning human passion. We see it in Daniel's eyes in his final match in the Karate Kid. We see it in Rocky, prepared to fight Apollo Creed with everything he has. We see it in Drumline, as the monolithic stage overshadows our heroes. We see it in Alan Turing in his struggle to break Enigma in the Imitation Game. 
 
We see it in μ's, in their fight to the Love Live Championships. 
 
Love Live Season Two is an anime that has been described by most as 'better than season one' or 'the best idol anime ever' but the series has gone above and beyond those simple standards and has become one of the most inspiring success stories I've seen in a very long time. The story is as simple as it can get, with nine girls aiming to winning the School Idol competition known as Love Live. Though it's hard not to admit the faults of season one, the difference between the two seasons is interstellar. As I stated, the burning passion and struggles from films like Rocky or the Karate Kid is very evident here as we see, finally, what makes idols so special. Before seeing this series, I had always thought idols to be like generic pop singers only with a cutesy side to them. You can tell how obviously wrong I was. From what I've seen, idols have a very distinct nature and goal, to shower emotion over the audience in their own unique spectacle. This is what I learned from Love Live and from no one else, as the girls of μ's struggle against themselves and each other. As the curtains come to a close and story of μ's nears its end, we're welcomed with one of the most powerful finales of all time. You've felt this sensation before. When your little brother made that game winning goal? Or when you aced your exams? Or when you got your crush to like you? It is the spirit of achievement and reflection that make this anime truly an inspiring experience.  
 
Now, I have nothing against stereotypes. And when they're utilized correctly, they can do great things. In the first season of Love Live, we were introduced to, well, about nine archetypes that had adequate development to become a bit more three-dimensional. But the godly characterization of the series in only 26 episodes has turned our girls almost human. We're introduced to feelings and thoughts we never thought these characters could have, underneath their stereotypical exterior that truly defines their character as a whole. An example  is Rin who expresses a very self-defeating nature, the same we see in people who suffer insecurity, in her arc which, I have to say, does extremely well to develop her character and features one of my most favorite μ's songs of all time (LOVE WIIIING. LOVE WIIIING). Honoka also gets a share of this, exceeding the 'genkiest is the leader' stereotype to a more definitive reason as to why she is the leader at all, allowing her characterization to truly define her as the one and only leader of μ's. But by far the best arc belongs to Nozomi, as, not only is her character expanded to degrees above and beyond, but it develops more the special relationship the girls have as μ's, the special feelings they share and why their separation would mean the end of it all. With all the characters given godly characterization, it's now not a story about Honoka, but about all of them. 
 
Now, I can't end this review without going technical. The music of Love Live is one of its main appeals, as a lot of the fans came from playing the musical game on their phones. The best thing about it is how distinct each track is in terms of delivery and emotion. The rhythm endowed that matches each story perfectly really emulates how in-tie music is with the series, unlike some others that like to just play random songs for the heck of it (K-On anyone?). The animation is also above average which is to be expected coming from Gundam-Printing company Sunrise. The design is stellar and gives these different girls a sort of unique flare that gives them distinction and makes them special. If it were not for the blonde hair, the ponytail and the baby blue eyes, Eli would not be my waifu today. 
 
If there were any way to describe this series, it would be inspiring. Being able to correlate both characters and story to the spirit of achievement, boiling with human desire and passion, in a way that is almost Grammy worthy makes this series truly amazing. Despite the somewhat flaky season one, season two is able to craft a story with meaning, emotion and passion.  
 
With top-notch characterization, a definitive success story and roaring emotion, I can proudly say that Love Live Season Two is one of the best of the best.  
 
(Written in honor of the Final Live and the end of the VAs's contract next year.  You will be dearly missed, μ's)

    This is my first review here so please bare with me. 
 
Samurai Champloo is a one of a kind gem. 
 
Story 10/10 
 
Samurai Champloo is about the amazing journey of Mugen, Jin and Fuu to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers.But it doesn't end just there.Along the way they face different problems which, they need to solve.Thare are different events in the anime from a graffiti battle to an epic baseball game.You're in for a hell of a journey. 
 
Art 9/10 
 
The art is just amazing for such an old anime.Characters are drawn with a style that fits the Samurai Era.The landscapes and structures are amazingly well drawn as well.The only downside was that some minor characters's art style was kinda weird. 
 
Sound 10/10 
 
This is where the anime shines the most.If you're a fan of hip-hop and rap music, then you'll definitely love Samurai Champloo's soundtrack.Every single track fits the scenes they are played in.From intense battle tracks to relaxing and cool tracks.But it doesn't end here just yet.There are also heartwarming tracks which are played during emotional scenes.The fighting sounds are also amazing.The sword attacks sound so realistic, and so do other weapons such as guns,scythes and spears. 
 
Characters 10/10 
 
This is also one of the strongest aspects of the anime. 
 
Jin is a calm and quiet type kind of guy, who is intelligent and looks like what you expect from a samurai.He is also extremely strong in kenjutsu. During battles he always keeps his cool and always fights with honor. 
 
Mugen on the other hand is the complete opposite of Jin. He doesn't know restraint and his recklessness knows no bounds.Unlike Jin, Mugen style of the sword is messy, but that doesn't stop him from being one of the most badass samurai ever in anime.He also doesn't obey the orders of anyone. Mugen only seeks battles with strong opponents. 
 
Fuu is the girl that formed the team.She is very determined and doesn't let anything stop her from achieving her goal. She is also a monster when it comes to eating. 
 
There are also many other interesting characters in the series with their own stories and reasons. 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
 
The action in Samurai Champloo is one of the best I've seen. Sword fights are so realistic, that you'll want to see more and more of it.The atmosphere is also extraordinary, because who doesn't love Japan during its Samurai Era ? 
Even though the ending didn't satisfy some people, it most certainly satisfied me.Samurai Champloo is at it's best balancing the comedy and the seriousness in the anime. 
 
Overall Rate 9.5/10  
 
Final Comments 
 
I highly recommend this anime to people who love samurai and who love the action genre as a whole. I guarantee you, you won't be disappointed! 
I also recommend watching the English Dub version of the anime, since characters sound better than in the Japanese Dub version.

    This is 16 minutes I will never get back. 
 
The plot is simple, fitting of a short a few minutes long, nothing to comment on really, I think it was aiming for touching or sweet, somehow, but even if it wasn't a little off, everything else destroyed it. 
The pacing was probably the worst part of the entire thing. Countless unnecessary cuts that just stretched on and on, this short was AGONIZINGLY slow, as well as jarring; the scene of the dream has about 6 5-10 second cuts of the old man just walking up some stairs. I wasn't counting, but I'm not about to go back and rewatch it. There were entire scenes that had no purpose. There were scenes that weren't even scenes. Judging by the description, this short should have had around 3 scenes. I'm quite sure it had about 10. 
The animation was amateur at best, which by itself it bearable, but amongst everything else, the old man's sleeping face is the stuff of nightmares. Some of the sets were decent, but the lighting was too poor to really say. 
The sound was unpleasant, offputting, and the entire time there is a strange scuffing clacking sound, like a poor representation of someone walking in wooden sandals, but I don't know what it was supposed to represent at all, other than to give you the feeling you're in a nightmare. 
There is an old man. This old man does several things in the short, non of which seem to be of any consequence, but who can be sure? The only thing I could call a characteristic would be his little finger being longer than all the rest. This old man had no character. The turtle had more character. It broke into his house and turned up in his dream, gives you a mysterious look in front of some conveniently placed photos and leaves. The old man basically just walks and sleeps, eats, goes to the toilet (apparently they had time for that in their 16 minutes) and goes to bed. Now I probably wouldn't leave the house with that face either, but shuffling and opening doors is not character building. 
I wouldn't wipe my butt with this if someone printed it on bog roll and left it in my bathroom. 
Don't watch this. And even if you decide to put yourself through this, do NOT show it to children, I genuinely think this would give some kids nightmares, it's unsettling af.

    Right from the very first episode, I knew that this anime was going to have a weird romantic triangle and I decided that it was not going to be my cup of tea. So, I did what anyone else would've done, I binged it (while fast-forwarding the slow parts). Well, I would've just dropped it if it didn't have such a high rating on MAL. 
 
And holy fucking cow! What a messy romance. A love-triangle? No.  Quad-? Penta-? No no. It was a freaking love Octagon. I don't want to watch anime like this again. I was really looking forward to see how the sea and the land people interacted more and the dynamics between them. But no, we just have to deal with this messy teen romance. 
 
But I would definitely be lying if I say that I didn't appreciate some of it's moments though. They were really well done. The artwork was pleasing. The story had a poetic undertone. The characters weren't your typical-anime-level dense. I can definitely appreciate all that.  
 
The ending was also pretty conclusive and I think it made most of the audience satisfied. But as for me, the one lesson I think you should take from this story is... FUCKING COMMUNICATE. The sea god didn't do it. His wife didn't do it. And they are going to suffer all of eternity for that. Sure. That's cool. But even at the very end, the two characters who should have learnt from this eternal mistake don't freaking say it out loud. Haha. Are you kidding me? What was the point really? Don't tell me, ""Oh you have to just feel it and understand it"". Fuck no. Communication. It. is. vital. 
 
Anyway, I'd love to watch an anime set in a unique world like this for sure! But anything with these weird romance plots, please... no.

    The first thing that I would say on Ao no Exorcist is that the Soundtrack Music is A-list Hollywood quality.  I fell in love with the soundtrack around episode 4, and since then, the music has never ceased to amaze me.  The composer and arranger, Hiroyuki Sawano, has managed to make a soundtrack that varies from tear-jerkingly beautiful to Hans Zimmer-quality Epic.  But, before I bore us all making love with a picture of Mr. Sawano, onto the rest of the story.   
 
If only the rest of Ao no Exorcist was as amazing as the music.  The premise is quite Shounen - You`ve got the son of Satan and a talented Twin - the typical rash sibling / calm sibling duo seen in everything from Fullmetal Alchemist to Clannad.  That said, the first few episodes stayed true to the manga, and seemed to be departing from its notably shounen premise.  That said, Ao no Exorcist`s plot, for the majority of the season, seemed quite reasonable, with a good pacing that seemed to suggest an ending similar to the manga and perhaps a sequel.  Yet, after around the 17th episode, things get weird.  Odd characters appear out of nowhere, and seemingly mundane characters return for odd cameos.  By no means is the plot bad - but it has long since lost the coherence of the first 10 episodes.  Instead, the plot has become something of a train wreck - still enjoyable by all means, but rushed and confusing.  The show is nearing its end now, with 22 out of 25 episodes under the belt--and though I look forwards to the ending, I am afraid it will be something that is so clearly cobbled together (As this last arc seems to be) that it will disappoint me.   
 
The art is nothing special - it is perfectly competent, and overall, the quality is never bad, but it brings little new to the table.  The characters as well are not deficient in any way, but they are nothing really revolutionary--as in most shounen anime, the focus is clearly more on the plot, which, in this case, does not help Ao no Exorcist`s case.   
 
That said, I continue to enjoy Ao no Exorcist--but only as a typical shounen anime.  It`s not bad by any means--but it just seems to fall short of the greatness it seemed to suggest in its first half.

    WARNING: Spoilers Included 
 
            Ok, So Evangelion is regarded as one of the most influential anime franchises of all time, and for good reason. Hideaki Anno created an incredibly absorbing world filled with mystery, symbolism, and dramatic intrigue. It featured a spectacular soundtrack, a diverse cast, and giant robots whose designs were both detailed and to some even terrifying. This movie will definitely by a nostalgic kick to anyone who enjoyed the original anime. 
 
            For any newcomers to the series this first rebuild movie serves to highlight the beginning of the anime series, or roughly the first 6 episodes of the original anime. If you have seen the show before you will undoubtedly notice subtle changes to the animation quality. Meaning, it is much better than it was in 1995.Backgrounds offer more details, mech designs are brighter and have more detail and more ""humanistic"" proportions, and characters are brighter. 
 
           If you are watching this movie to see something new you will most likely be disappointed (save the last 5 minutes). However, it does alter character interactions (mostly through specific dialogue) to hint at something greater. If you are new to the franchise then it serves as a great introduction to the characters and to the world of evangelion without being too vague on key topics such as Lilith, Seele, and Gendo Ikari's own interests.  
 
            However, this movie is not perfect, it simplifies complex character ideas down to a few core motivations for the sake of expediting the plot and some might find the sheer number of Angel fights to be a bit heavy handled for storytelling sake.  
Story 8/10  This is mostly because it offers little new to previous eva fans but the nostalgic value as well as reasonably deep character motivations make investing emotions into these characters worth it. 
 
Art 9/10   Simply put the animation is great. If this stuff looked like this in 1995 I'm pretty sure everyone the world over would have crapped their pants oogling over how bright and fluid the fight sequences look. 
 
Sound 9/10 Eva has always been known for a great soundtrack and this is no exception. I especially loved the ending theme that remixes the original Fly Me to The Moon from the original NGE. 
 
Character 8/10   One of my few gripes is that these formally complex characters core motivations have been broken down for plot simplicity sake, but a lot of what made them great is still there.  
 
Enjoyment 10/10   This ova movie looks great and it harkens back to a simpler time in anime when teenage kids going through puberty wasn't cute and hilarious but dark and made us feel like we could picture ourselves in their shoes. It looks great, and for fans of the series provides an excellent trip down memory lane. For newcomers it offers a mech series with intriguing characters and designs with plenty of action and lore to keep you interested. 
 
Overall 9/10 I really wanted to give this one a ten, but the fact that it offers very little new content keeps this from getting my top score. However, I did not have much to gripe about since I am also a huge fan of the original but would say that if you want to know more about these characters motivations and backstory then you should watch the original series rather than the rebuild sequels.

    'Boruto: Naruto Next Generations' is a disaster of a sequel to 'Naruto: Shippuden'. It takes place some years after the original story, and follows the life of Boruto Uzamaki, son of Naruto Uzamaki (main character from the original series). In the first episode, we receive a preview of an epic storyline to come. As of writing this review, there are over 100 episodes. What was previewed in the first episode almost feels like click bait. Its premonition has never come to fruition. There are a few good moments, however, most of it is filled with disappointment. 
 
Accusations of being a Filler Anime: 
 
The show has often been accused of being filler. Technically this is false, but the way each episode and arc is told, people can be excused for thinking this way. Characters' personality and development seem to reset after every arc, with the same mistakes repeating over and over. Nobody ever seems to learn from their actions outside of the current arc. It makes for a less than compelling viewing experience. 
 
There must be at least one good moment in the show? There are two particularly well executed moments in the show: 
 
First, the Sarada Uchiha Arc, which follows Sarada Uchiha in her quest to learn more about her father. The animation in in the eight episode arc is quite stunning. The fight scenes are memorable and the whole thing feels like good development to Sasuke's (member of the original cast) character. 
 
Second, the fight between Boruto, Sasuke, Naruto and Momoshiki. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, and the choreography is top tier. I personally consider this to be one of the best fights in any anime. 
 
""Stockholm syndrome the animation"" - I once heard Boruto described in this way. Basically, those who continue to watch defend its existence and presence as if their life depends on it. The two aforementioned moments trick viewers into thinking the anime is good. Of course, enjoyment is subjective, and different people experience things differently. Those continuing to watch need to ask themselves: what exactly is it which makes me watch Boruto every week? 
 
Overall rating: 4/10. The storytelling is very poor. Characters have no development outside of two arcs. The only saving grace is the animation and art can be stellar at times. 
 
Those who have never seen Naruto: Shippuden - stay away. You will find absolutely no enjoyment in this show. All of Boruto's best moments piggyback off the original cast of the prequels. 
 
Those who have seen Shippuden - watch episodes 17-24 and 51-66. You don't need to watch anything in between, as outside of these two episode ranges, the characters are static and receive no development. These episodes are very good and worth watching if you are a fan of the original show. 
 
Boruto is a lot like smoking cigarettes. You had a few good times and feelings in the past, and now it has become an addiction. It is currently not providing you any worth, yet you watch it anyway out of habit.

Before watching this anime, ask yourself the following: 
 
Can I enjoy watching anime that are so bad, but become enjoyable just BECAUSE they are so bad? 
 
If your answer is no, don't watch this. If it is yes, you might give this a try. 
 
First of all, the story. This anime really doesn't explain you anything. It's just a vague mess of (censored) gore, (censored) cannibalism and (censored) fighting. It's kind of funny, tough since they even censored a knife at one point, yes. A knife. And to censor it they used a ray of light that... covered atleast 30% of your screen...? 
 
Then the characters, to keep it brief: It's just as vague as the story. Apparently the main characters are a brother and sister, the latter occasionally eats her brother, yes. Eats. I won't tell you about the other characters since they are just as vague and even harder to describe for me. 
 
The art is very bad, there aren't many movements and the characters are poorly drawn. I do like the opening art, but the opening is just a mere slide-show. The opening might even be the best thing of the whole anime since the OP-song is good in my opinion. 
 
I only watch this anime because it's kind of enjoyable to watch, since I'm one of those persons who can watch something when its 'So bad it's good', but if the episodes where longer than 5 minutes I would have dropped this right away.

    When lolis and basketball are combined, the result isn't as bad as one might expect. Although it's far from great Ro-Kyu-Bu is a charming series. 
 
If you are looking an anime that is heavily focused on basketball then you are looking in the wrong place. Basketball is simply the activity which brings everyone together. However the series does lack a solid plot because the focus is on the characters themselves making it feel like a slice of life some of the time. The series is character driven and the majority of this anime is spent developing the characters, which is okay but it makes it hard to comment on a plot that's hardly there. Nevertheless how each character develops combined with the ""practice"" and games are fun to watch. 
 
The art is good but it isn't anything spectacular, the characters designs, the backgrounds and animations are all decent. But there is nothing really special. 
 
The sound is solid. The opening and ending are really catchy and they really fit the anime. The voice actors did a great job too, they all fit the personality of the character they were playing. 
 
The characters is where the series excelled.  The variety of personalities work well together and you can feel the bond that the characters have and develop with each other. Each character undergoes a significant amount of development and by the end each character has overcome something that has been holding them down. The series is driven by these characters if you took out any character the series just wouldn't be the same. 
 
Ro-Kyu-Bu is very lighthearted which could make for a very fun watch.  It is not a bad way to pass the time but it's not something everyone can enjoy. Some people aren't just into this kind of thing and sometimes the series does get a bit corny. 
 
Ro-Kyu-Bu is a pretty entertaining series (if you are into this kind of anime). It's not a must watch but if you are bored, watching this isn't a bad way to pass the time. Also this series just shows how lolis+basketball does not equal disaster.

    I love how people have already judged the anime and it hasn't even ended yet...has 22 episodes and is on episode 16, yet people are already criticizing it. Guilty Crown is a great anime. I will admit, it does have similarities to my favorite anime of all time, ""Code Geass"" but it has its own original qualities. If people want to give a movie a bad review, you wait till the end of the movie to do so. Don't be premature and rate it when it hasn't even finished yet. A lot of questions are yet to be answered. For all anyone knows, there could be a season 2. Code Geass has 2 seasons. I like Guilty Crown. The characters grow on you. Some people like fast paced animes where questions get answered the episode after the one which left all the questions unanswered. Sometimes the answers won't be answered till the end....just be patient....it's not like you have anything better to do. Do what i do, and watch multiple animes at once so you dont wait all pissed off every week to not have your long awaited questions unanswered from 1 anime. If you take away the fact that code Geass was an amazing anime in which this anime seems to be very similar to, then you people would enjoy it. Not many things in this world came about from not copying something at one point and improving upon it...Not saying this is an improvement on Code Geass, but, nothing can top Code Geass. I suggest watching this anime all the way through, and if you don't like it, that is your opinion. You are entitled to it. I for one like the anime as of now, but that could change. Most animes leave me disappointed with their half-assed endings. Hopefully Guilty Crown has a good ending or has a 2nd season. A real 2nd season! Not like what some people consider this as being the 2nd season (Ep 13-22).

    This anime left a kind of empty, hollow feeling inside me. Not because it was bad, far from it. But because it could have been perfection, had external factors not stopped it from reaching its full potential. 
 
Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou is the closest to true romance I've ever experienced in anime. It is an effective character study following 2 flawed people who are able to confide in each other, as they can empathise with the feeling of pretending to be someone they're not. Drama is created mostly through watching their relationship progress naturally, and the pacing in the first half of the series reflects this excellently. The mangaka did a fantastic job at giving emotional weight to every progression the relationship made. I never thought the mere act of holding hands would have me on the verge of tears, but it was so much more effective than the overly-dramatic confessions we see in other shoujo anime. And Yukino's internal narration here was far more poignant than any bombastic declaration of love. The fact that the anime didn't shy away from the fact that teenage relationships do get physical, and went as far as to show that the two leads had sex (obviously no explicit scene though), was a breath of fresh air. It was a very mature take, and the way Hideaki Anno directed the episodes he had control of made it feel very real, very intimate. 
 
The music was lovely. The OP and ED were catchy and upbeat, but then they would show up in the actual series with different arrangements at just the right moments, and somehow absolutely break your heart. The orchestral version of the ED during the hand-holding scene especially affected me. Other than this, the other musical motifs that would appear during the moments of drama were also perfect, in my opinion. 
 
The characters were another strong point. Yukino is simply the most relatable shoujo protagonist I have ever witnessed. She has very clear insecurities and flaws, however she's not incredibly dense like many other leads in the genre. She works out why situations have occurred by herself, logically, and then takes the initiative to solve them herself instead of acting like a victim and letting her love interest do it for her. She's complemented perfectly by Arima, whose problems do run a lot deeper psychologically, but we can see him slowly be opened up by Yukino as the series goes on. 
 
The comedy also worked well, it made me laugh more than once. Yukino is hilarious and I'd definitely have been friends with her in school. Asaba is also a legend and his rapport with Arima is great. Maho's reluctant remarks during the Tsubasa arc were some of the high points of those episodes too. 
 
As I was watching the first few episodes, I really thought this was a 10/10 series. If it had ended at Episode 18, it very well may have been. But it didn't, and due to production issues and the mangaka apparently disallowing her manga from being further adapted, things started to go downhill. 
 
Firstly, the animation steadily declines as the series goes on, with the lowest points being Episode 19 and the final episode. This was quite a shame, as I actually did enjoy the character art quite a bit, as it was expressive but still beautiful. The anime is very much a product of its time on that front, unfortunately. 
 
Another issue was the abundance of recap and filler episodes. Some of the filler was enjoyable to watch, for example the story of Yukino's parents, or Tsubasa's family issues; however the entire final arc, with the play and Sakura's relationship with Tonami began to get on my nerves, as it got in the way of the progression of Yukino and Arima's story. Don't get me wrong, all of the side characters in this series are very well developed and likeable, however the fact that the series ended on this note without finding closure for Yukino and Arima left a sour taste in my mouth. The biggest flaw of this series is that it ends when it does. I dearly wish it was allowed to go further. 
 
But in the end I still have to give this series an 8, despite all its flaws, because when it was doing the right thing, it was doing it so well that it changed me - somewhat like how Yukino and Arima changed each other. No amount of shabbiness towards the end would make me forget the moments that moved me. His and Her Circumstances will never quite leave me.

    Barakamon on the surface is an anime revolving around a young adult who goes to a remote island to grow up after an altercation at a calligraphy competition. Although this plot seems limited, the plot is not what carries the show to being a truly memorable experience. Its the characters that make Barakamon.  
 
Barakamon has a reoccurring cast of  roughly 8 characters, each who are well developed over the show. The way each character learns, grows, and interacts is what makes this show really touching. The kids feel like kids, the adults feel like adults. Humor is used nearly flawlessly throughout the show, and the way a normal day can be made so eventful through silly antics, and cute interactions was quite impressive. I found the way the MC changes throughout the show was really entertaining, and each of the kids was lovely. The way they hastle Sensai, and mess around is really entertaining, while they add to the growth of sensei and the town itself.  
 
Artwork was great, sound was simple but well utilized.  
 
Overall, this show is best described as fun. not to much happens, but what does is very entertaining and enjoyable. you love the cast, you love the humor, scenery, and the subtle hints about the craft of calligraphy.  
 
Watch Barakamon if you haven't, its a great simple show to just feel good, have fun and pass the time.

    Some people have asked themselves, what is hatred? Where does it come from? 
Well allow me to clarify those things as best I can. 
Hatred is a means for one to obtain power quickly while rendering himself blind in the process. It is born from the sins of humanity and it is also the responsibility of 
humanity to pay for those sins. 
 
The second season of Freezing presents  evolves around a research center in Alaska where the protagonists travel as part of their orders. New faces are revealed, old ones stand in the spotlight once more as restlessness and conflict grips the facility. 
 
Not only does the artwork reflect the amount of fanservice of this series, it also puts the objects ofthe fanservice on the foreground. As such there are few background scenes that will amaze you. 
 
Soundtracks are made mainly to back up the suspense , the fighting scenes or the emotional moments of the series and are done in a good fashion. 
 
Characters have numerous personalities each with it's own reasons and ways, something uncommon these days. These many ways to be specific to one character each decrease the level of predictability of the series. 
 
Overally I enjoyed the series since the fanservice mostly blends in with the story. However the message is a strong one and it is one worthy of remembrance.

    To be honest, I struggle with the idea of reviewing second seasons, especially for slice of life. I'm gonna try to keep this brief. 
 
Story: 9 
The story hasn't changed. Four girls who take over the abandoned Tea Club for their own amusement. They're still in middle school- more importantly, they're still in the same year of middle school. This isn't addressed until late in the series. While this anime is literally just more of the first season, around the end of the series things start to get strange. The second-year students still seem to be second years, there are some odd moments of deja vu, and for some reason they bring back a wooden sword.. even though they already brought back a wooden sword? This show pulls something similar to Non Non Biyori Repeat, in the way that it just shows different moments from the same time period, yet it's different because it's not a rewind, but somewhat of a time loop. Even the characters notice something is odd! 
What really makes this season so much better is a particular episode that really tossed my feelings around. It was good because it was parallel with some of the small details of the first season, and it happened in a way that really could be seen as possible. Then there's a bunch of emotions and long-awaited, much-deserved attention for a certain girl, then there's the ""Psyche!"" that just blocks everything out. I've been emotionally abused, but it was still hilarious. 
This show has several moments that really kept me guessing until the punchline hit, and I found everything to be positively cute, stunning, and simply amusing. 
 
Art: 9 
I can't really tell with the art. I didn't notice any differences between the first and second season, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. There don't need to be drastic changes, or even changes at all. This goes for Yuru Yuri especially since the setting or time didn't really move either. 
Everything is still well-drawn and everyone is cute as ever. 
 
Sound: 9 
New music, great voices, and sound effects that fit with the action and add to the moments. Not much else to say, I'm not a sound critic. 
 
Character: 10 
The characters didn't change either. Same people, except we're introduced to a couple new characters: the older sisters. They aren't completely explained all in one go, but there have been enough cameo appearances beforehand to at least understand a bit about them. The older sisters simply add to the comedy, outlining the personality traits of the main characters pretty well. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I still like this show. The second season doesn't stand out as new or exciting, but it's still lovable and funny and cute like the first. 
 
Overall: 9 
Definitely not a masterpiece, but as a successor to its first season, Yuru Yuri ♪♪ does not disappoint. If you enjoyed the manga or the first season, you have absolutely no reason for not wanting to watch this one.

    Wow, i would have never thought i would enjoy this as much as i actually did. Interesting enough i started wacthing Freezing right after a ""more intellectually pleasing"" anime (Seikai no Monsho)... because once in a while i need something plain fun. And Freezing totally delivered. 
 
Freezing is your typical ecchi harem anime with Sci Fi elements to it. I won`t write anything about the story because you could as well read the summary on MAL, so i get right to the point: I really liked the school setting in S1 as it established the characters and their conflicts very well. But be prepared to see your typical fight of the week between characters structure in this show (at least in S1). The main plot about the Novas isn`t really big part of S1 (and even S2 (Vibration) only slightly touches it). Many people complain about the shift from the relationship between Kazuya and Satelliser in S1 to the relationships between all the pandoras in S2, but i really felt that S2 (Vibration) profited from it and is the better season. All in all S2 is much stronger in exploring the backgrounds of the characters (especially Satelliser) and a very faithfull adaptation of the manga. 
Though i have to say the overall tone of the manga is somehow darker. 
 
Animationwise Freezing and Freezing Vibration are great The fights are always a joy to watch, especially when it comes to the creativity of the animators on how to ""undress"" the pandoras during the fights.^^ 
 
Conclusion and note about the manga: Freezing is a very faithfull adaptation of the manga. Both seasons are a pleasure to watch even though the story isn`t anything to complex/intellectual or let me say quite silly at times. The reason why i write this review though is the fact that S2 doesn`t end on a cliffhanger that forces you to read the manga. The ending is a very well done conlusion to the show with a climactic finale. Even though you don`t get to know the origins of the Nova in the anime at least it gives you a feeling of closure and that is very uncommon when it comes to incomplete manga adaptations. 
 
*** For anyone who wants to continue with the manga after the show. The 2nd Season (Vibration) ends basically in Ch 91 of the manga, so you could contiue with Ch 92 of the manga. 
 
S1 + S2 (Vibration):

    Following the invasion of 2010, Japan has fallen to the Holy Britannian Empire. Now called ""Area 11,"" its people have been reduced to second-class citizens. Lelouch and sister Nunnally, by birth members of the Britannian Royal Family, live in Japan under fake names and are thought to be dead. When children, their family was attacked, resulting in the death of their mother and crippling of Nunnally. Now, Lelouch wants nothing more than to get revenge against those that took part in the attack and his father, the ruthless ruler of the Britannian Empire. When caught up in an incident with the military and Japanese liberation fighters, he meets and forms a contract with a mysterious girl named C2. With his newly attained power to control the minds and actions of others, Geass, Lelouch sets out to free Japan and put an end to the Britannian Empire. 
 
Code Geass is everywhere. Log onto any anime forum or do a search for ""best anime series"" and you will probably see Code Geass (and its sequel, R2) listed. After finally watching it, I have to say that the hype is warranted: simply put, Code Geass is one of the best series around. It wastes absolutely no time getting you hooked, and is one of only 2 or 3 series that I've seen which doesn't have a single dull episode. As the story centers around the Japanese resistance to Britannia, much of the show is filled with fantastic mecha fights, but even when there isn't fighting the characters are so entertaining and interesting and the plot so well developed that I was never bored. More than just a mecha anime with a nice story, Geass focuses on the symbolic battle between Suzaku and Lelouch over the moral and efficient way to deal with the rule of the Britannian Empire and the resulting subjugation of the Japanese people; this culminates in an intense ending that will have you rushing to watch R2. 
 
Geass' animation is bright, beautiful, and features superb character design. Fights are fast-paced and never repetitive, and a heavy focus on Lelouch's use of tactics makes them superior to those in your typical mecha series. The OST is very nice, creating suspense and capturing the mood of nobility life perfectly: of note are ""Cold Nobility,"" ""Occupied Thinking,"" and ""Nobless Oblige."" While both voice casts are exceptional, the English cast really shines with an all-star group including Johnny Bosch (Ichigo in Bleach, Kiba in Wolf's Rain), Yuri Lowenthal (Sasuke in Naruto, Kuma in Afro Samurai), and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (The Major in GitS, Lady Jagura in Wolf's Rain, Julia in Cowboy Bebop). All of this comes together to make Geass a wonderfully addictive, well-presented anime that must be seen.

    I have to say being a sucker for Greek mythology this caught my eye by chance. I watched it on a whim and surprisingly it's a very good series. I even went as far as tracking down the original Saint Seiya/Knights Of the Zodiac to seen if it was just as good and that one captivated me too. If you're one for for a lot of blood shed and Greek myths. I definitely recommend this and the original series as well ^^

    While watching this I couldn't help but notice somethings, like how the plot to this series seems like it takes bites out of bleach, FMA bro, and fairy tail. Honestly it seems like a combination of a whole bunch of popular anime... but then again most popular anime do. Regardless the show seems to acknowledge that fact, spit in its face, and continue moving on. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Like I said before it seems like the story borrows from many a source, but that's no reason to deface it, nor over look it. The plot is brilliantly done, setting its own pace in regard to how important certain parts of the story are. It isn't held down by having to please action hungry little kids by having a battle every chance it gets. This very reason is why I do not consider this anime to be a shonen. It takes its sweet time when developing characters in depth. The last fight scene in the ending battle was a bit too short in my opinion, but other than that I see no problems. 
 
Art: 10/10 
Outstanding effects, and stunning visuals. the protagonists and even the supporting cast all are drawn differently which says a lot for their artistic genius. Rather than just pick a base model and draw everyone accordingly, each character is an individual. The scenes are realistic and not in the least repetitive, really well thought out. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
Both opening themes are amazing, though I favor the first. Both ending themes are ok (the first is some kind of Japanese N Sync, the second sounds like Brittney Spears) just a grab for attention by using more popular bands rather than meaningful songs... no matter though. The sound track seems a bit borrowed, but it is utilized well throughout the show. The voices fit the characters well, nicely done. No dubbed version is available yet, but seeing how its so popular, its just a matter of time. 
 
Character: 9/10 
very nicely developed characters. The series does its characters justice developing them at different paces and in different ways as well. The supporting characters are developed quite nicely as well. The cast often times grows together but even then they develop in different ways rather than a generic growth for all of them. Realizing different things while all together. There is great mystery involving many characters and the show does well to keep it a mystery until it wants you to know. 
My only problem with the cast is, I would really like to know more about Fujumoto. The dude was such a badass! Alas it was not to be... 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Action sequences that will leave you begging for more, relationships that will keep you smiling, and grievances that may just touch your heart. The show employs few twists, but when they come, you'll have no idea what hit you. 
 
I haven't read the manga, but I heard it goes beyond this point. So it is very likely there will be more to come, but don't hold your breath. I just hope they don't turn this into another shonen disaster (naruto, bleach, one piece, ect...)

    One Piece is something which can not be explained by words, even though I will try my best to do it. Most people say One Piece get's better as you keep on watching the show, and I totally agree. But there is always a downside to the upside, newbies to the show. We ask all the time when does it get better? When does it get better? The truth is, if you don't like the first 100 episodes give up the show, got it? That's my perspective of this arguement against newbs and fans.  
 
Now, time for the actual review.  
 
Story: One Piece starts off very slow, when it comes to the storyline, but it improves as times go on. The story in One Piece can not be explained in 200 or even 300 episodes unlike some animes. The world is so complex and the story just adds to the world itself. Keep in mind that, One Piece does geniunly excell at story in later episodes, such as my personal favorite, Alabasta Arc! 
 
Art: One Piece is not known because of it's art style. In fact, I would call it mediocre. I don't personally favorite the art style, but it's better than some other animes I have watched. 
 
Sound: The soundtrack for this anime is very good. It provides decent OST's which makes the anime way more exciting and impressive. I want to say though that the soundtracks do get repetitive as time goes on. Each character also has their own music track apparently because of the mid-show cutscenes which depict the character, and their own music which is fun to guess for me. 
 
Character: I don't know how to stress this enough! The character's in this show are off the hook! The charcacter development stems way beyond any other anime or manga I have watched/read. You may become so attached to the characters, you might start hating the villians because you hope they won't sever that connection you have with those characters. 
 
Enjoyment: This anime get's a nine for enjoyment. I know what all of you fans are saying though, ""WTF!??"" and ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!??"" because One Piece deserves a 10. The only reason I put a 9 was because of the starting episodes, and other than that this definitely is pure awesomeness. This world is so enjoyable and so are the characters. In fact, I would say it's easy to get addicted to One Piece! The beginning episodes though, not so much! Some people might say though, that the story is slow-paced, so they don't like it, but the story must be slow-paced in order to explain this magnifecent world! 
 
Overall: One Piece is amazing in it's own ways, but does have flaws in it's own ways too. The pro's outnumber the con's though, but there are still a bunch of cons. This world truly is worth giving a try, but be warned if you don't like the first 100 episodes, just quit! I give this a 9!

    Earlier before Shingeki No Kyojin (SnK) Season 2 started in April, Wit Studio launched a cheeky full page ad on the Japanese newspaper apologising to the public on how the weekly airing of AoT episodes may impact their social life. Most fans would have brush this off as an air of arrogance and bragging from the Studio team, after all Wit Studio has kept SnK fans waiting for season 2 for almost 4 years and clearly the hypes has somewhat dies down a lot since. To made matter worse, there were only 12 episodes announced which was enough material to just to cover the Clash of Titan Story Arc (Manga Chapter 34-50).Lots of fan were clearly disappointed when hearing this news but to me after finished watching the 6th episodes, my disappointment has turn into excitement because Season 2 will probably goes down as one of the best season ever. 
 
So what have changed between Season 1 and Season 2 during the 4 year MIA? Lets discuss: 
Story 
We continue from last season shocking ending reveal where we found out what's hiding behind the huge walls that has been protecting the remains of humanity from Titan. The Scouting Legion have also make progress by capturing Annie who is the Female Titan with great sacrifices but were not able to find out anything further due to Annie enclosing herself in an unbreakable crystal prison. 
In Season 2, we start off with the opening episode with news of Titans appearance but the mysteries deepens when the soldier were unable to find the wall that was broken. 
As some of the old mysteries are resolved, more questions/strange mysteries appears just like the Beast Titan appearance which gives user more room to conjure up new theories about AoT. Brilliant  
If you have not read the manga, be prepare for more shocking reveals especially on the quest to reach Eren home basement where the biggest mysteries is 
I would give the scores for the story segment a 5 out of 5. 
 
Art 
No doubt the artwork have maintained the highest quality in anime standard and i do sincerely believe the artwork actually surpass Season 1.  
The atmosphere in the night scenes looks spooky and the new titans are actually kind of terrifying to the viewers. The only downside I have is the frequent use of CG but it is not so bad in my opinion as the animation team need to handle their limited budget for each episode carefully. Anime viewers need to pay close attention to the details like the scenery to truly enjoy each AoT episodes. Also I love the new camera angle put into the animation this season.  
I would give the scores for the art segment a rating of 4.5 / 5 
 
Sound 
This area is where Snk shines the most irregardless of OP/ED themes, sound effects, or voice acting.  
The new OP sung by Linked Horizon is great and it will slowly grows on you while the new ED is creepy but in a good way that it leave an impression on the viewer.  
Some of the BG has been reused from Season 1 but there is also new remix and new BG heard for this season which fits into the anime perfectly. 
I really can`t wait to get hold of the new SnK album release this June 2016. 
I would give the scores for the sound segment a rating of 4.5 / 5 
 
 
Character 
Season 1 focus more on the main trio which is Eren, Armin and Mikasa whereas Season 2 is expanding on the backstory for the side character like Sasha, Connie, Reiner, Bertolt, Ymir and Christa. I`m glad that Isayama build up the side characters which made us sympathies to their back story as the story progress. 
rate: 4/5 
 
Enjoyment 
Season 2 start a bit slower in the beginning but things are going to go wild with the remaining 6 episodes. I sincerely believe that there is a chance that Season 2 has every reasons to top Season 1. 
Will continue to watch this till it ends in 6 weeks. Hopefully we don`t have to wait for too long for Season 3.

    Persona 3 the Movie: Spring of Birth is a movie tie-in that is based on the 2006 JRPG video game, Persona 3. It has three other sequels which come after this, and the movie was set in the same story as the Persona 3 video game storyline with only a few tweaks to help differentiate both the movie and the game AND to avoid any repetitions from the story that could ruin the experience of the audience of this movie. 
 
And before you continue on to read my review, let me get you a warning that the following you're about to read here are SPOILERS related to the Persona 3 game. If you haven't bought the copy of Persona 3 or you didn't play Persona 3 before, BUY IT! I MEAN, RIGHT NOW! But I'll recommend you to buy Persona 3: FES and it is currently available now through PSN! And for those who don't have PS3/PS4, PCSX emulator is your second choice. If you don't have a PC, but you're reading this on your android, play the Persona 3: Portable for the PSP, PSVita(?) and for the PSP emulator as well. But if you don't have any PS consoles, ranging from PS2 to PSVita, but you own a XBox, that's a bad news for you. No Persona 3 for you guys. Sorry. 
 
Alright, enough beating around the bush. Let's focus now on the review. 
 
So, the story has almost the same as the game though. It has the same plot where your character, (insert name here), goes to the dorm and signed a contract. It has also the moving calendar that help you what date it is, and it has the same chores, like going to school, meet new friends to develop a new social link for your Persona, beat the s*** out of those shadows ever dark hour, etc.. 
 
But here in the movie, well, on the very first part, it has now explained why the train was ""delayed"" while you were on the train on the very first cutscene of the game. According to this movie's first part, a one guy who wears a hoodie decided to suicide for unknown reasons. When I watched that scene, I was like... 'huh? Where did he come from? And why did he take suicide?' So, after that, we went to another scene where we saw our protagonist, (insert name here), was listening to ""Burning my dread"" in his earphones, while riding the train to Iwatodai Station with some announcement that there's a ""delay"" because there's an ""incident"" happened on that place. And as the protagonist already touchdown the Iwatodai Station, he looked at the pamplet that shown where our protagonist must stay, at the dorm, and after for a few moments, the dark hour spawns. The same as in the game I've played on P3P, he's just walking calmly until reaches to the dorm. There, he met the mysterious kid, who later name as Pharos, gives him the contract to sign the deal to choose his own will, etc.. thingy. And as the protagonist write his name, it was revealed that his name is ""Yuki Makoto"". And as the day goes by, he went to school, he met both Junpei and Yukari on the very first day, you did the same assignments as you've played in P3 like, killing the first shadow who climbed to the rooftop of your dorm, killing the shadow who controlled the train, and battling the two arcana at the entrance way of Tartarus. 
 
But there's a difference though, because during the rooftop incident, if you're wandering if the fight scenes on the game (choosing attack, skill etc. to attack the opponent) has the same as this movie. Well, movie newbie to the tie-in games person, you're wrong, silly. We instead watch our protagonist, by name of Yuki Makoto, is going to fight the shadow in a fighting scene just like we're watching ""Fairy Tail"" or any magical anime shows you can think of. Although, the battle was a bit short but at least, it gave a dramatic style of fighting as we could feel how P3 was like without the ""player choosing a tactic to defeat the enemy in the game"" style. 
 
The plot here in this anime was ranged from the very first part up only to the part where they've rescued Fuuka Yamagishi from being stuck in Tartarus for 12 days (12 hours in Dark Hour time). And to be honest, it's quite a good start to begin with. But I don't see any memorable moments just like I played the game on my PSP emulator due to the slow pacing of the plot. But at least they bring the stuff from the game and put it into a movie, which is great! And making this movie as a movie rather than a live-action movie is a very good way, AND IT MUST STAY THAT WAY TOO. Because if P3 became a live-action movie, let's face it guys, IT SUCKS. Because if this P3 became a live-action movie just like Attack on Titan did, we might be able to see so many cringe worthy fights and expressions coming from the actors, screaming ""YAMETE!"" with their horrific dramatic pose as possible, and horrific CGI shadows that will ruin the face of the game itself. And it might cause chaos to some fans of P3, myself included. 
 
Back to the topic, as for the fight scenes, well, the only thing I do like about fighting scenes in this whole movie is that after they rescued Fuuka Yamagishi from Tartarus, the group must fight the two arcanas. But as they struggle to fight back, Yuki came to the rescue from the dorm (yes, the plot changes here for those who wanders) and tries to defeat the two arcanas. As they struggle to fight every inch they've got, Fuuka then soon realize that one of the two arcanas has a weak point. And with that, the group fight back to defeat both of the arcanas thanks to Fuuka's advice. It's not actually on the game though, ESPECIALLY when the time that Yuki is riding Mitsuru's motorcycle. Which is cool though, especially from his entrance from entering through Tartarus, but that's unprecedented to see that. I really laughed when Yuki did that, yeah I know, I admit that was cool, but I don't think that fits on his style as he's a HS student WITHOUT any background to any vehicle he drove. Seeing him in a bike really fucked my mind though... And I really laughed on that scene at the same time... xD I can't take it... 
 
Is there any changes that could help differentiate the movie to the game? Yes. Too lazy to write this so I just took it from the ""http://megamitensei.wikia.com/"". So here's the ff. difference from the movie to the game: 
- All the major characters appear in the movie intro (except Aigis), while the anime cutscene at the beginning only shows the Protagonist, Yukari, Pharos, and Mitsuru. 
- Makoto doesn't interact much with other social link characters, only a few.  
- It is revealed in the movie that the first victim devoured by shadows in the anime cutscene was named Sakata Masashi. 
- In the anime cutscene he appears in Tatsumi Port Station, but in the movie, he appears somewhere in Port Island Station. 
 
- Some characters make a cameo appearance: 
  - Bunkichi and Mitsuko make a cameo appearance during Fuuka's visit at their       
    bookstore. 
  - Koromaru and Maiko Oohashi make a cameo appearance together. 
  - Ken Amada also appears briefly. 
  - Kenji Tomochika appears in the arcade and after exam results are posted. 
  - Kazushi Miyamoto makes a brief cameo after exam results are posted. 
  - Hidetoshi Odagiri appears while interrogating one of the students of class   
    2-E. 
  - Nozomi Suemitsu makes a brief cameo in Wild Duck Burger. 
  - Aigis appears in a post-credits scene. 
 
- When the Shadow attacks the dorm, the Protagonist stops to look at the full moon outside the window. Yukari asks him if he cares if he dies, and the Protagonist says he doesn't and he asks her if she's scared of death. A Shadow attacks the window and Yukari dives to save the Protagonist. In the process, her leg is cut by a glass shard and bleeding. None of this occurs in the game. 
- Junpei's Believe or Don't was told in May instead of June 1. 
- While discussing about the ghost rumor from 2-E, their meeting was in Wild-Duck Burger instead of the dormitory. 
- Makoto does not accompany SEES during the June full moon operation due to his personality until he fully realizes his friends are in danger and he goes to save them. 
- This is first time where Makoto and Natsuki interact with each other, whereas that was not featured in the game. 
- In the movie, Natsuki heard the voice after witnessing the school transforming into Tartarus, but she heard it in the dormitory in the game. 
 
For the art, the characters' appearances here are heavily modified though from light colors from the PS2 game to dark colors to this movie. And as for the scenery of this anime, it's pretty good. Overall, it was a fantastic art to see here. 
 
The sound here is remarkable though. Because when it comes to OSTs, they bring some of the P3 soundtrack to the movie, which really gives a nostalgia feeling to some viewers who've played the game. As for the VA, to be honest, I felt like kinda uncomfortable when I watch this on English sub rather than the dub because, the dub version on the game is pretty good. But when it comes to Japanese dub in this movie, it seems kinda odd, I never heard what they'd sound like in Japanese. But I'd say it's quite good nonetheless. But as for the MC, Yuki, well, it's kinda a bit-odd also seeing the first time my character talks, but in a quiet fashion rather than his personality in the game who sounds like more energetic and has a colorful life. 
 
Speaking of personality, the character development here didn't do much here at least. Especially Yuki, who is an introvert, one-sided guy who doesn't care about anything. To top it all off, Yuki, unlike on my character on P3, he's more like a selfish type of guy and doesn't talk too much. He doesn't even show some emotions and whether they're already nearing at the signs of danger, just like on the train scene, he looks calm and collected rather than he's going to panic and don't know what to do. But his character just changed at the ending of the movie where he smiles after he rescue Fuuka. But it still doesn't change the fact that Yuki is still raw when it comes to the development. And as for the other characters here, again... ALL OF THEM have no development whatsoever. Maybe we'll going to see that on the next film. 
 
Overall, the movie was good. I don't expect much of the change here. But I was intrigued and enjoyed at the same time. Hope there's more changes on the next film just like this one, and I hope it's better than the first one.

    Ippo Makunouchi... the most evil villain who ever lived. 
 
This anime is perfect. If not perfect, then damn near close. It's easy to be skeptical, sounds ridiculous, I know. Over 70 episodes and still gets straight tens? Well believe it, it's real. The sounds and music are epic, memorable, and perfectly on point. The art mixed with the sounds gives real weight to the punches. The characters are nearly all unforgettable and unique. Lastly, the story is so well put together and balanced that I frequently reminisce about the first episode, decide to watch it, and the next thing I know I've re-watched the whole series.  
 
Everyone should know what Hajime no Ippo is all about by now. That said, this is my fourth time watching it, and I have developed a bit of a different take on the series. Prepare for a plot summary review of Hajime no Ippo: the story of the rise of the greatest villain in anime history. 
 
*SPOILERS AHEAD* 
 
This is the story of Ippo Makunouchi, a second year high school student who has been bullied for his entire life. Downtrodden to the point where his biggest wish is to know what it feels like to be strong. Then one day he finds his chance when he is introduced to the world of boxing. 
 
He starts off his career strong, by breaking the spirit of a kid who has been training his entire life. Ippo comes in as a complete amateur and wallops him. Defeats him, ultimately surpasses him, and forces him out of the country. Effectively starting a lifelong rivalry that he isn't even fully aware of. Watch Ippo as he moves on to bigger and better things, destroying boxers one by one. Crushing the actual dreams of others so that he may further his dream of being strong and having fun boxing.  
 
Watch as a humble soldier comes to Tokyo to win money to repay his impoverished Japanese second family for all they have done for him, only to be trounced by Ippo and sent back with nothing. Marvel at Ippo's tenacity as he wins the Eastern Rookie Tournament by destroying a man's only hope of making a decent living and paying for his sister's college tuition after their parent's died in a terrible accident, then prepare for your heart to be set aflutter when Ippo later decides he wants to bang that opponent's aforementioned sister. See the exciting clash of the East and West Rookie Champions as Ippo travels all the way to Osaka to flatten the region's hero and make little children cry. Cheer for Ippo as he faces down and ultimately defeats his toughest opponent yet, a Russian national who detests violence but fights against all odds so that he may afford to nurse his sick mother back to health. All of these fights are just stepping stones, though. Merely checkpoints along the road to his ultimate goal: Facing a man who lost his dreams, his unborn child, and the respect of his wife... in an attempt to take away his title belt and, with it, his pride.  
 
All because it fills him with joy. All because for him, it is fun. He has found that it is what he wants to do in his life more than anything else. And because he feels like the crushed dreams of the people he has defeated are now carried in his fists, making him stronger.

    My first review goes to this anime for these reasons: 
 
1.) An action-packed anime full of emotions. 
2.) It teaches you values and moral lessons. 
3.) It greatly depicts how society works. 
4.) All characters are interesting with a clear motivation and backstory. 
5.) Each episode will keep you hanging until the end. 
 
Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is one anime you should never miss out. I am always on the edge of my seat everytime I watch this anime. No wonder I finished 2 seasons in 2 days. There is no boring scene, nor an irrelevant scenario just to fill the anime. Every episode guarantees you a time of enjoyment, contentment and emotions. Each characters will spark your interest as they all have their own backstory. No characters are left out, each individual has their own development. Intense villains with a clear motivation as to how they block the protagonists will make you abhor them. Teachers who always gives lessons and values on how to solve your own obstacles by not stepping down to anyone. The students who I believe you will all get attached to, and watch as they build their individual characteristics as the series progress. I strongly recommend this anime as it brings out the fun in education and gives you hope in life while showing off action-filled scenes, and emotional episodes until the end.

    Story- The story in Akira was original, powerful, and left you with a lot of thoughts and ideas swimming around in your head. There isn't another anime like it, and it's a classic. Although I found that in some places it was a little bit hard to follow. 
 
Art- Personally, I am not a big fan of that kind of art, but it was good all the same. 
 
Sound- the sound was good and really demonstrated what was going on. There could have been more music, though. 
 
Characters- The characters all had their own interesting story behind them, but I think that this could have been explained a little bit more so that we can connect more with the characters. It would have been nice to see more detail in the relationships between characters, and some characters were quite similar to others.  
 
Enjoyment- Akira is action packed, and in some places, quite shocking. Very good. 
 
Overall, I enjoyed Akira. It was a good movie.

    Code Geass Season 2. 
 
What a journey! It has been a great ride watching this show from start to finish. The only bad thing about season 2 is that it kind of falls apart around the middle of the series. But episode 19 or 20 onwards to the end, it is AMAZING! The ending is my favourite of any show that I have watched!  
 
It's great! 
 
Must say though, really the hype kind of kills the enjoyment of the show, you just gotta love it for what it is.

    Establishing an interesting and entertaining story with likable characters within a mere two minutes per episode is definitely no easy task. That being said, Ame-iro Cocoa doesn't even seem to try. I'm not saying there's absolutely zero effort put in, but it's so miniscule that one can barely notice it. There really isn't much to say about Ame-iro Cocoa, so this review will be relatively simple. 
 
Story: 2/10 
To be frank, the story is nonexistent. It's just a bunch of random scenes strung together with no sense of an actual plot. You follow five male characters who work at/visit a café called Rainy Color. These guys talk to each other and their customers about random, mundane subjects that goes nowhere. That's pretty much it in terms of its plot. There's no progression, no development and nothing interesting happens. I suppose I shouldn't rag on those points that much since Ame-iro Cocoa is just a comedic short, right? Well, even the comedy was dull and lackluster. 
 
Art: 4/10  
The art and backgrounds are simple and plain, but passable. The animation was lacking, though. Since most of the focus is usually fixated on the characters' simple dialogues and interactions, there's not much worth talking about in terms of its animation. Also, the character designs are generic shoujo fare with not an ounce of creativity put into them, so they were just bland and uninteresting. 
 
Sound: 4/10 
The sound is probably the best thing about this series, but that isn't really saying much. The soundtrack, background music, and voice acting all got the job done, but none of them stood out in any way. The background music is just there and it's easily forgettable. The opening and ending songs are very basic as they're just your generic, run-of-the-mill pop tune that you hear countless times in these type of series. The only good thing was that the Japanese voice actors were all fine and did an okay job portraying each character, but that's a given. 
 
Character: 2/10 
All the characters are very lacking in depth in almost every category. They're all unimaginative cardboard cutouts of character types that we've seen many times, and they bring nothing new to the table. Since the runtime is only 2 minutes, there's no room for character development or progression, so don't expect anything more than basic interaction. Since all the characters are painfully boring, I felt no appeal or connection with any of them. Overall, very weak characters. 
 
Enjoyment: 1/10 
If you just want to turn off your brain and watch a simple short with no substance, then sure, you might actually find some sense of worth in Ame-iro Cocoa. Since I usually don't care for those kind of series, I didn't find much enjoyment in it. Yes, it doesn't take much time to get through, but you can definitely spend that time watching something better. Everything is so pointless and boring that you'll just end up questioning yourself why you're even watching it in the first place. 
 
Overall: 2/10 
I award Ame-iro Cocoa with an overall rating of 2. If you skipped this extremely lackluster short this season, then I applaud your wise judgement. If you didn't and want something worthwhile, then I highly suggest you just let this one pass you by because all you'll find here is a waste of time.

    Hello all! I am new to the anime reviewing front, but I am going to try to do my best at reviewing this anime. I started out just thinking this would be another basic harem anime with the same characteristics in the characters, the same plot, the same school setting, and the same old ending. This anime was actually quite different, the plot was extremely different from any other harem I've seen and was very enjoyable, although, somewhat predictable. The introduction to the 2 types of people: saviors and kuromas, was a very cool concept in my opinion.  
 
Now I'll get down to the actual review. 
 
Story: I found the story to this anime very good. It included a lot of aspects quite a few animes neglect to add, such as flashbacks and others. Not only was the story good, but it has the watcher wanting to come back for more and more. The ending was the icing on the cake, a perfect finale, finishing the anime perfectly. My rating for story: 10/10 
 
Art: I found the art of this anime exceedingly good for such a small-time anime studio such as Diomedea ,check them out, they have much other good anime, and the fight scenes for this anime was excellent. The camera angles and character art could have been better at times, but was all around good. I give it a 8.5/10 (I'll give it a 9 for the benefit of the doubt) 
 
Sound: The OST for this anime was very decent, I am not going to say I liked any of the songs other than the intro. 7/10 not bad, but could be improved, especially fight scene music. 
 
Character: The main protagonist in the anime is a very well made character, and I loved seeing him in the anime and how he reacted to certain things. BUT one of the other main characters, I found absolutely annoying and certainly taking away from the anime. 6/10 they could have definitely added some spice to the other characters. 
 
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime, thoroughly.  After what seemed like every episode, it would leave you with the feeling of wanting to see more. I will definitely re-watch this anime in the future. 9/10 very good 
 
Overall: With everything I've just said in consideration, I rank this anime with an overall score of 9, I was going to give it 8, but the whole point of anime is to enjoy it, and I certainly enjoyed this one. I think if a few things were improved this could be an iconic anime everyone needs to see.

           Inuyasha is by far my favorite anime. I was one of those kids who did not know what i liked when i was a kid. Then the second i watched Inuyasha, I was hooked. I like it because it has a good story line that last for a good chunk of episodes. Every character has their own distinct personality, and even the minor characters you get to know really well. As it progresses, you learn a lot about the main characters, and you seem to develop a bond with them. Although i might add that it is a bit slow at first, but then when you get into the higher up episodes it's action packed, and hilarious at times to. Inuyasha is and always will be my favorite!

    The Phantom of Baker Street has always been one of my favourite Detective Conan movies. I like its characters and story. 
The idea of a virtual reality game such as Cocoon and an artificial inteligence like Noah is really fascinating and may be products that will be created in the future. 
 
But there has always been one part of the story, that I do not understand until today. Schindler is supposed to be a descendant of Jack the Ripper, but why should that be a problem for Schindler and his company? It is not as if he were responsible for who his ancestors are. How would people make Schindler responsible for that in any legal way and why should they? That doesn't make sense to me at all.

Story 
Episode zero for most shows should be what will happen. Yes, characters were identified but context of the show remained a mystery. It was said to be a comical take on science but the question remains was it? they had what can only be seen as their first example but perhaps it was the translation made little to know sense. I felt i was a student tasked with a writing assignment. Although having seen the show writing down what i seen was not a matter of not understanding the material but having a poor teacher. 
 
Art 
background animation was cheap and unclear. You get a vague background that is moderately colored in. There was no wallpaper. If asked with life hanging in the balance if this was set in a person's room or a weird space rift in time or something else i would most likely lose life due to having to guess. Transitions were okay. 
 
sound- no issues 
 
Character 
well documented. No questions for the most part on who was who. 
 
Enjoyment 
Could be a delightful show. Could be a foreign based show where living in japan you would understand the context. From how is stands alone it is not worth watching given the confusion.

    Just curious, how longer will they be smashing the hopes of poor viewers in the end of the series? Why should they make every second one into something sticky, made of a concentrated purple goo? Yep, Akume no Riddle, it’s about your creators. 
Characters fap-fap-fap. I couldn’t get a grip of the m=names, expect for Haru (Haru wo mamoru, I’ll be saying this while doing illogical things). The main heroine is fit to become an ideal soldier, why don’t they have more of her. And the others! Stamp in on stamp here, raw materials barely make a single line. Even in Danganronpa they had it kinda more livelily. Mi-nu-s. 
Dat logic made me getting a vicious dump. I thought the director is the laziest man in the world. I was about getting my on-duty washbowl, when… *spoiler*. And that’s it! Everything fell into place. Then *spoiler* again. The problems I even wasn’t aware of have got rid of. Yet the final scene disturbed the good impression, I think that’s because some people have a bit too much vitality. But it’s a plus. 
The same goes for the place. At first you are scrambled upon some black classes, assassins, way too elite schools… *spoiler* makes everything clear. The world at once becomes well-made and ready-to-defend-itself-against-your-criticism. Well yeah, just not bad, it has noting new or interesting in particular., and it’s wasn’t even planned that way. Simply plain. 
GRAFICS. And SOUNDING. I frealing love it when each episode has its own ending theme. There are even descent ones. The opening is much more promising than the anime itself, and you can’t ignore it. At least everything is pretty and well-animated! Characters fap-fap-fap (da voices even make my desire stronger), especially the red-haired one, left behind near the end. Haru is quite something too. And the school. And it’s a plus. 
The plot. The plot. It seems there is one, but on the other hand – is it needed? – you think for yourself while watching before *spoiler* occurs. Then it happens, and… What’s “and”? An artless “kill or be killed” story with a tiny bit of pure girls’ love. The last episodes start to interpret the previous ones freely, adding up a certain degree of THE DRAMA, but without answering the questions. As I seem to respect THE DRAMA here, there’s no minus. 
Well… minus-plus… turns out to be a mediocre, casual anime which, however, has everything it takes to excite an unsophisticated viewer. If you don’t look into details much, you can even gain pleasure of it. It ain’t like you are anime for its final, right? Yet sure thing you won’t be looking forward to the promised sequel, damn it… Have a look at cute schoolgirls? Here you go. They even have weapons! I don’t know a man who’d stay calm and, ermmm, not get excited. 
5/10. It’s normal; there are much more bad things. But for you to know – you should watch this BEFORE Danganronpa and stuff.

    Sometimes, initial impressions can be highly deceiving. Chuunibyou is an example of that. 
 
Incorporating elements of drama, moe and SoL, Chuunibyou is a superb show, displaying a remarkable level of literary and technical depth, and appealing to many different viewers as well. 
 
Drama, characterization and plot are well executed, making this show one of the most enjoyable this season. It is only around the later episodes that one truly comes to appreciate the level of thoughtfulness and sophistication that went into the creation of this show. Whilst the first 1-8 episodes seem like pointless interactions, it is later revealed to be metaphorical to the inner struggles of Rikka, the female lead. In this respect, it is even better than Clannad which, for the first half IS just messing around. 
 
Story and character is superb. Rikka steals the main focus of the show in the latter half of the show, reveling an interesting, well fleshed out character. Yuuta, as the level headed male lead, provides the driving push behind the plot. On the other hand, Nibutani and Dekkomori act as supporting characters, at times providing support for Rikka and at the same time assisting in her character development. Nibutani is an interesting character in that she hides part of her character. Her personality is caustic, and yet she acts as the motherly figure for many of the characters. To top it off, she, like Yuuta, is a past [spoiler], which adds to the comedy. Whilst it is true that each character falls under a specific archetype, they are all masterfully expressed and their personalities certainly do not feel overused. 
 
Humor is well executed, drawing on the various quirks of all the characters to provide an enjoyable watch regardless of the story. One criticisms I have is that both Isshiki and Kumin could both be removed without impacting on the overall show, although both are integrated in a way that is hardly obtrusive to the developments of the main characters. 
 
As expected from KyoAni, art and sound is equally as impressive. Character design is original, with the short quick ""Chuunibyou"" scenes allowing KyoAni to show off their animation skills. Another criticism that could be added is that the art is rather typical, and there is certainly a high level of similarity in the way the eyes have been drawn. Despite this, the art is certainly superb. Shading, detail and lighting has been well done, contributing greatly to the general feel and atmosphere. Music is fitting, and the OP sets a lighter tone for the darker themes in the latter episodes. Elements of moe has been undoubtedly incorporated, and expressed mainly in Rikka(heck since when has KyoAni made anything that doesn't have moe). Although some may object, the moe certainly adds to Rikka's character, reminding us at times that she is still a (human) girl. And to be honest, I like some moe fanservice. 
 
Overall, Chuuinbyou has been an excellent show that has stood out in this slightly lackluster season. Highly, highly recommended.

    This "" anime "" is very good. The scenes, the story, the characters,etc. I love how she tries to survive and try hard to protect the country. For the story, I would give it a 9 cuz it is good. For the art, I didn't expect much of it but, yeah it's still can be use for me. Characters man, I love the characters. I don't actually get much enjoyment from the scenes but, from each plot twists, I would rate it 10. But still, I would give it a 7 for overall. And this ""anime"" have some great surprise at the ending so, you can actually watch this till the end even if you have done your thing. 10/10 best ending of all time.

    This review contains minor spoilers in the “characters” paragraph and will be about the 2 seasons. 
I precise that I had played the Visual Novel before and seen Fate/Zero and the Fate Stay Night 2006 adaptation before seeing the 2014 show. 
 
Art:8.5/10 
Overall very solid, we got here the very display of Ufotable’s experience. The background and landscape of various part of Fuyuki city are detailed and beautiful. The palette of color was good and breathe some life into the anime.  
As expected from Ufo, the best part was the animation during the fights (through non battle scenes were also good): dazzling effects combined with an excellent fluidity, I was really captivated by the clash of high speed blades and the impressive choreography of the servants in battles. The art was a real pleasure for our eyes and the strongest point of Fate UBW. 
However 2 flaws, the face of the characters were a bit weird (their chin were often really sharp) and there was a perceptible drop in the quality of the art and animation in some fights of the end. (Budget problem, lack of time?). 
 
Soundtrack:6/10 
Lackluster and often too discreet. It somewhat failed to reinforce the epic or dramatic side of the story like Kajiura’s soundtrack in Fate Zero. Personally I found the general tone of the ost a bit weird and quite forgettable. Which is a shame when the original soundtrack of the VN (but also Deen’s adaptation) were already very good, unsurprisingly, the best theme IMO was EMIYA theme’s remix from the visual novel. Sound effects and the seiyuu’s job were good. 
 
Characters: 5/10 
Through not the most interesting Shirou of the 3 routes of the visual novel, the anime pretty much failed to describe us Shirou. It failed to stress that he is an empty boy, traumatized by the great fire who had no other dreams than the one borrowed to Kiritsugu and who can only exist by the help he provides to other people. Instead I was under the impression that the anime portrayed a fairly unidimensional idealistic shonen hero who always shout his ideals, louder each time... 
Saber was rather uninteresting which was predictable since the story do not really focus on her, but still.  
Rin and Archer were rather good I guess, though I was not fund of her tsundere side in the first place. 
 
Story:5/10 
Standard battle royal’s scenario and several good plot twist, especially one. The problem was not the story itself but instead the execution of it.  
Maybe the greatest problem of this adaptation aside from the weakness of Shirou’s portrayal, was the pacing: too much dull scene that do not really bring anything to the story. Even for someone who had never seen the show, some explanations and events were just too redundant and long. Typically after 5 min watching an episode, I could predict that no major event would happen until the next episode. The thing is that the slow pacing did not really allow to develop Shirou’s intern character. 
The pacing of the battle was also too disjointed to be appreciable, for example the greatest battle was extended through 3 episodes which was just too much, generally speaking the dialogues and the flashbacks were unnecessary long and cut the rhythm at the middle of the fight so that I often lost the excitement at the middle of the battle.   
 
Overall: 6/10 The problem is that the serie fails to achieve its goal either as a “popcorn show” (not a pejorative word, I enjoyed Code Geass) with little pretention, just like Deen and either as a more mature anime because of the lack of depth of the characters and the story. In the end I lost all my hype and watched the anime as a rather passive spectator. I must say that is anime is with no doubt my greatest deception of  2014/2015.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
""It's never a coincidence. It's a choice"" 
 
Great, another incredibly made anime movie that really hit me hard. Not gonna lie, I put off watching this anime solely because the title is really weird (a common theme of the medium, nonetheless). I mean, if you don't read the synopsis, you might think there's an apocalyptic world where zombies need to eat pancreases to survive and the main character has to fight off the zombies with a couple other people that survived at his school (basically every zombie anime ever made). This movie, however, is completely different. And that's where we can start this review... 
 
Story: 10 
While I won't say this story archetype is completely cliché, I can't say it's entirely original. A reclusive guy meets a girl from his school at his hospital (I really want to say coincidentally but that won't do the movie justice), and because he finds out about her secret about no longer having a functional pancreas, she decides to befriend him. At first at least. They start to bond as she forces her way into his life (hey this sounds extremely familiar right [Your Lie in April]) despite unpopular opinions from their school, and he begins to open up to her and later even those around him. It's a great story to show some character development, but I'll have to discuss what really stood out about the story a bit later... 
 
Art: 8 
The art isn't bad. Some scenes are absolutely gorgeous, like a lot of anime movies seem to be. But some scenes were really strange visually. The anime is not supposed to have weird visuals like that as in other shows like Mononoke, so I wondered what could have been the problem. I do some research, and of course the root of the problem is also CGI. Anime can be so beautiful, so why does CGI also have to ruin it. But again, the CGI was well-hidden from me at least and just made some scenes bulky, so it wasn't as bad as some other shows I've watched (Tsuki Ga Kirei I'm looking at you). 
 
Sound: 8 
Soundtrack wasn't bad. Nothing particularly stood out to me, but I enjoyed the music and it went well with the scenes that were playing. Definitely deserves a solid 8 though. 
 
Character: 10 
Now we can start to get into some of the good stuff. The characters really really made this anime a shiny gem for me. We got two opposite ends of the spectrum: the quiet guy and the popular girl. One would think their relationship can't work, but holy crap it can. The synergy between the two only works because these characters are who they are, if that makes sense. Sakura relentlessly forces Haruki to talk to her and open up to her, and he starts to reveal that he isn't really as bad as people perceive him to be. Sakura shows him that his perceptions of others may not really be how they see him, and Haruki is able to give her the reality and normalcy that she wants from her peers even if she has a terminal illness. Only Haruki can know of her illness yet still treat her the same, which really lets their relationship grow. Haruki's character development is also HUGE, and you can really see how much of an impact Sakura had made on him despite their short time together. The vulnerability of the two main characters also made them feel so human, as I could relate to so many things the two of them did (Haruki's philosophies and Sakura's façade in front of others).  The other characters just really support the relationship between the two, so I won't touch too much on them. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Definitely loved watching this movie. It really spoke to me and taught me how death can come so unexpectedly even if it seems so far away. At the end of the story (this is why I have a spoiler alert), Sakura dies so unexpectedly that even I was shocked. I feel like some other shows that have tackled terminal illnesses and death like Your Lie in April lost some light because it was so obvious when the main character was going to die. The length of the movie as well as the unexpected cause of Sakura's death just shocked me. I felt myself go through the same phases Haruki must have went through because we had all thought that she would die from pancreatic disfunction rather than murder. The struggle to cope with such a sudden loss is much more relatable than a predictable death, so viewers could much more easily empathize with what was happening in the film. That notebook at the end was also pretty significant. While it didn't jerk as many tears as the ending of Your Lie in April, Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai really opened your eyes to how the characters really felt about what was going on and provided further insight to the struggles and memories of Sakura.  
 
I'll also add that I watched this movie without reading the source material, which I noticed was used to judge a lot of what happened in the movie in other reviews.  
 
Overall: 10 
Wow, this movie really earned an ez 10 from me. Really annoyed at myself for putting it off so long, but it was a great emotional ride to watch. I feel like the themes that this movie tackled were tackled really well, so props to the production crew for that. Definitely recommend this movie to anyone really. The movie made me contemplate on some decision in my own life. 
 
Thanks for reading :D

    I'm surprised that this shit sells so much, this movie used the cake formula that is used throughout fairy tail. 
 
° The famous strategy puts your half-naked characters tossing their breasts. 
 
°Making appear strong enemies that give a beating in the protagonists, soon after the defeat they fight again and of course that our heroes win (kkk). 
 
°Then appear an even stronger enemy and use the wonders of the power of friendship and protagonism to defeat him. 
 
About the characters I can say the design was very good the used trait left the characters more beautiful than in the anime, as always the design of the female characters totally unnecessary showing up some differences in the measurements shown in the anime (Wtf !!! that sena of Erza in the bar what the hell those breasts were). 
 
I think it is not necessary to comment much more about how deplorable and uncreative is the story of fairy tail

    This will be the first of my series of reviews for the ARIA animes. My perspective on these reviews will be based on how I felt after finishing the season my first time. 
 
ARIA the ANIMATION is the first season of the series adapted from Kozue Amano's AQUA and ARIA manga series. I will say right off the bat that this is not an anime for everyone, for those who cannot stand slow paced, happy and calm slice of life shows this anime IS NOT for you and should turn around now :P 
 
Story: In the year 2301, Mars has been terraformed into a water planet and renamed Aqua. Neo Venezia, an exact replica of the old city of Venice, was build on Aqua. It is there where Mizunashi Akari, a girl that has come from Man-home (formerly called Earth), has arrived in hopes of becoming one of Neo-Venezia's trademark female gondoliers called undines. As a slice of life anime, there is not much of a real ongoing plot going as most of the episodes consists of the day to day life of Akari as she trains under Aria Company with her friends in order to become a full fledged undine. Regardless, each individual episode has a certain charm to it that draws you into the world of Aqua, so its not so bad. 
 
Art: As far as the character art goes, it is nothing incredible, but it is consistent and well animated. The real charm in ARIA's graphics are in the backgrounds and landscapes which resemble the real Venice with incredible accuracy. The sky, the oceans, and the city looks beautiful in this anime and is a real treat to watch. 
 
Sound: This is without a doubt the best aspect of this show, the various instrumental and vocal songs in this show really makes you lose yourself in the world of ARIA and are just very enjoyable to listen to. Some of these songs are so relaxing you might find yourself slowly drift into drowsiness sometimes when watching this show. 
 
Character: Another great aspect of this show are the characters, the six main undines we are introduced all have their own distinctive personalities and they all interact so well with each other that just watching them talk about everyday events is very entertaining to watch. I would describe ach character to you but its better to just experience them yourself to fully enjoy it. 
 
Enjoyment: I'm surprised I managed to watch such a slow paced show yet not feel like I wasted my time. I was on the verge of falling asleep various times watching this yet I did not hate it. There is a certain charm in this show that kept making me come back to it. And im glad i did. 
 
Overall: This is a very good show, however if you decide to watch it I recommend that you DONT marathon this 4-5 episodes at a time. This is an anime meant to be enjoyed at a slower pace over a longer period of time. Watching this show felt like going a tour around a city that both fictional and real. It was a very calming experience and i can definitely say I enjoyed watching it.

    Rascal may not dream of Bunny Girl senpai, but Azusagawa surely dreams of a decent relationship. 
 
First of all, I've got to say I loved this anime. The main character isn't generic, and actually very smart. The ""science phenomenons"" representing real problems from teenagers, like social exclusion, self-hatred, regrets and dichotomy, were really interesting, and I would really like to see more of it. 
I liked the way the situations were handled, the humour and specially the bizarre dialogue. The characters quotes are PURE GOLD, specially out of context, and the main reason I kept up with the show in the earlier episodes. 
The characters were enjoyable, and I have to say Kaede's story touched me, for personal reasons. I liked them all. Except for Mai. 
 
Spoilers ahead regarding Sakuta's relation with the main female character, Sakurajima Mai: 
Mai works as model and actress. She has a complicated relationship with her mom, and an identity crisis. When she is disappearing from society, Sakuta does everything possible to save her, but because of some phenomenon he has no relation to, he unavoidably forgets her for a while, but is able to remember her and solves her problem. He does this by humiliating himself in front of the whole school. 
And how Mai repays him? By being a bitch. 
I'd like to clear that she is not qualified as a tsundere or any of these charts. She is just... annoying as hell. It's not her obligation to date the main character, she has her own will, of course, but never gives him a clear answer. She just keeps teasing and torturing him, they never get in a real relationship and none of her actions make sense. She blames him for things he had no relation to, and her appearences in most of the episodes are just to remind us of the B-Story of his intent to get the ""bunny girl"". We could get more of her insights in the body change episodes, but it just show us that she is ""perfect"" while her sister isn't. Aside that, the other Mai-focused episodes were the first ones, where she spent the whole time provoking Sakuta with the romantic ideas he possibly would have regards her. 
 
Sakuta didn't invest too much on her because he had a lot in his head during the season. I mean, the world around him was falling apart, and he have to work to save his friends. If she really wanted something out of this dating, she could have done her part, I mean, it takes more than one person to build a relationship. However, in the most basic things she was pointless, like their ridiculous failed kiss scenes. There's the movie coming and I'm glad it's about Mahouka and not them both. I mean, the possible hallucination girl had been more helpful to the main character in 2 scenes than the bunny girl was in a month-span story. 
 
I still give it an 8 because of the quotes, and of course the rest of the story.

    *Minimum Spoiler DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!!! Review* 
TL;DR: No, this is not a Inuyasha remake. It's your typical Japanese Shounen version of ""Breaking Bad"" but with good vs evil mindless sci-fi that makes you question, who would win? Some edgy teenager or some wholesome grandpa! Oh there is also Anime Trump! 
[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 5/10, Art: 4/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 8/10] 
 
""So, you're telling me... I'm the villain?"" - Hiro Shishigami 
 
Inuyashiki is your classic psychological sci-fi anime, by the visionary mangaka, Hiroya Oku (GANTZ), where the core idea explores the juxtaposition of two ideologies centered around a single question: ""What makes a person ""human""? Especially when that person used to be a human but after a slight alteration with Aliens, they are nothing more than a reconstruction of themselves out of spare parts. This anime is a bit twisted at times when looking at humans moral ethics and at times ludicrous with its out of character ""bang bang"" fight sequences. However, it is enjoyable to watch albeit its questionable CGI animations and over the top finger banging skills. Regardless, if you don't mind watching a mindless yet mind-tickling sci-fi action flick, then just watch it. The story in a nutshell is about a shunned Grandpa, Inuyashiki, who dies by alien crash, gets resurrected as a machine with all of his feelings intact and serves justice. Little does he know, the same fate happens to Shishigami but instead of serving justice he commits mass murder. The interesting part of the story is that they both have the exact same power and limitations however one feels humanly emotions from saving people and the other from killing people. This very simple good vs evil setup helps us explore and enjoy the show rather than getting caught up in a convoluted ambiguous melodramatic plot drama. The story is edgy and real to an extent that you can sort of question yourself, ""well, if I don't know them, do their lives really matter to me."" Regardless, the story is adapted pretty well by Studio MAPPA and has a solid ending. Whether it is good or bad that's for you to decide.  
 
""He isn't Hiro anymore. He is just a killing machine."" - Naoyuki Andou 
 
The fun part about this anime are the characters. They main two characters Inuyashiki and Shishigami are polar opposites of each other. They are juxtaposed so well that each of them become foils for one another. You have the morally ethical eponymous protagonist, Inuyashiki, on one end of the spectrum and then you have the chaotic unethical eponymous antagonist, Shishigami, on the other end of the spectrum. Best part is, they don't really realize if they are the typical ""hero"" or ""villain"" till half-way through the anime. The side characters aren't too well developed other than Andou, who is best friends with both Shishigami and Inuyashiki and acts as the control variable or represent the viewer evaluating the decisions of both. In a way, it just makes this unrealistic sci-fi anime more realistic and grounded to our society.  
 
""I want you to spend the rest of your lives thinking about the people you’ve hurt and the lives you’ve ruined.” - Ichiro Inuyashiki  
 
Aside from the linear plot and polar opposite characters, for a studio like MAPPA, the CGI animation didn't really live up to its expectation as the show progressed from the first few episodes. By the end, the CGI animations in the fight sequences seemed choppy and some frames were noticeably poorly drawn. If they maintained the quality throughout, this show could've been even better. However, the OP Song ""My Hero"" and the ED song ""Ai wo Oshiete Kureta Kimi e"" were really suited for this anime. They are fun to listen to over and over again. The background score was pretty decent. However, since this anime did deals with death a lot, maybe more violin background scores could've enhanced the show. Lastly, the seiyuus did a great job. They made every character feel important. The seiyuu for Inuyashiki was spot on. Kudos to him.  
 
""Anyway, did you hear? There are already 10 fan clubs for Shishigami"" - A mindless chick from the anime. 
 
Overall, Inuyashiki is your typical mind-tickling sci-fi anime about two people with the same power but different goals; where one feels alive when saving lives and the other feels alive by taking lives. Sure it deals with some moral ethical dilemmas however it's a show meant to not be taken itself too seriously. If you prefer serious psychological shows, then Parasyte is what you are looking for. Nevertheless, If you don't mind mishandled CGI animation and want a good laugh by watching a kickass Grandpa, then definitely give this show a watch. Let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Bang!  
 
P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!

    Well you see I gave this anime a 10 overall because of my enjoyment. But by no means is every aspect of this show a 10. This show didn't have that interesting a story, characters weren't the most memorable, and by no means was it special in some other aspects. But the things this show had that comepletely hooked me were the animation, art, and the story telling itself. The animeation is so memorable when used with this so very different art style. The art style may at first seem as though little time was put into it but in all actuality it is the exact opposite. The art truely is something different and special. To the average anime fan this may look like shit but for those of us logical enough to see it for what it really is know how special it is. The story telling that this show presented is really the true anchor of the show to me. I truely felt invested in all the characters not because they were something totally new but because the way the story was told and presented. Especially since this show is so short and concise they simply tell the story they wanted to and then it's over. I felt as though I got a truly compelling story from start to finish with this show and in the end that's the main thing I look for in anime. Also I just felt like writing this review because I saw someone gave this show a 3, and this is my first review, so please understand that why this was short and didn't go that in depth.

    Loved this anime. Overall, I think there were a couple plot wholes within the plot (obviously). But well review that part later.  
First off, Im going to review the characters starting off as my own zodiac sign, Iku Mizushima. 
 
Iku Mizushima, does represent me in a way. *SPOILERS AHEAD*  
His band members, (Friends of mine) were using him for his money. I can really relate to this character after deaths,and mis fortune, and basically doesn't trust many people. So as you can see, he is my favorite character for emotional adaption reasons.  
 
Yoh Tomoe, didn't make sense to me. His dis trust in others for being ""French""? He was a really confusing character at first, i started to like him more and more through out the series. Hes not at all my favorite character, hei cant really understand his past like i did with Iku.  
 
Kanata Nanami, another emotional related character. Love him to death, the illness thing really reminds me of some of my siblings, half of them have that sort of mental disorder. 2nd favorite character, also for emotional adaption. 
 
Suzuya Tohzuki, reminds me of myself. I love to cook, I'm really protective and sometimes dark about things. I myself have a dark side sort of the same as Tohzukis. 3rd favorite character, for yet another relation.  
 
Im not going to review all the characters, Im just lazy like that. Anyways, on to the Plot! 
 
I had to kinda figure out the plot through each episode, it had me thinking for brief moments. Im not sure whether it was just me who had to figure out the plot for myself through at least one, two, three episodes. But i did. It made sense for every episode i watched, the plot thickened at some moments but i liked that.  
 
 This was my review for starry_sky! Hope you enjoyed, thanks for reading!

    My updated/rewritten review: 
Animals as the main protagonists in Japanese anime has always been something of an oddity. Anime that do feature beastly buddies in the place of humans have tended to be a bit of a mixed bag, but thankfully, this particularly series is one that pulls it off pretty well. 
 
The plot starts out with the focus being on human characters. As of episode 7 however, the genre suddenly shifts to focusing on the main protagonists, the dogs. The once mute canines, also gain voice actors, and their true personalities start opening up. The very sudden change in pacing may throw off some viewers, but ep. 7 is when this series really takes off the ground, and everything before that was simply a build-up to this point. 
 
Now, the main plot in GNG is a fairly basic one. Silverfang/Gin, the eponymous protagonist of the show, sets out to find fellow dogs in order to defeat Akakabuto, the bear antagonist of the series. Akakabuto is a VERY standard villain, he's seemingly evil just for the sake of being evil, so if you're looking for something with a more ""mature"" or out-of-the-box plot line, I'm afraid you won't find it here. GNG is, for the most part, standard shounen anime, only with dogs instead of your usual teenage human heroes. 
 
Akakabuto, and the other bears in the series, remain mute, so we never get any kind of insight into their own back stories. There doesn't seem to be any particular reason why the bears enjoy killing off the human and dog cast. Maybe it could be argued that the bears are simply defending their territory, and that the humans/dogs are the real villains. 
But we're told early on in the series that Akakabuto goes out of his way to cause trouble for villagers. The only real explanation we get is that he holds a grudge against dogs and humans due to having his right eye shot, blinding him. 
 
Whatever the reasons, I find myself caring very little for the dogs' end goal of slaying Akakabuto and his army of henchmen bears. 
But despite the main premise being insanely bare-boned, the series more than makes up for it with its very semi-episodic format of Gin and the gang finding, and convincing other dogs to join his pack. It's simple enough, but it's genuinely engaging to watch what plays out in these situations. There are some very interesting canines to be met along the way, which brings me to the pooches themselves. 
 
--- 
 
This is arguably the show's strongest point. While the villains are about as interesting as porridge, the same can't be said about the dogs. There is some good character development throughout the series, especially with Gin, who grows from being a pup trained via animal abuse, to becoming a respectable leader. 
 
The dogs' personalities, while not amazing, are interesting, and there are some very likeable tykes throughout the cast. Some of the dogs may seem like antagonists at first, but later turn into allies, making them much more interesting (pseudo) ""villains"" than the bears. 
 
Although I didn't develop any kind of real, emotional attachment to any of the characters, I did find myself genuinely caring about them whenever one was mortally wounded or killed. And death comes often in GNG, don't think for a second that any dog is safe, main characters are killed off fairly frequently. 
 
There's plenty of action and (bloody) fights throughout the series, which is to be expected of something in the shounen genre. While somewhat repetitive, they're a lot more enjoyable to watch than you might think, with some unexpected moves/scenes thrown in from time to time. 
 
--- 
 
The artwork is pretty much what you'd expect out of an 80s show. It ain't great, but it isn't completely terrible. Perhaps my biggest issue is how the dogs' mouths seem to be almost constantly open. It often makes them look dumb, especially when talking. There's also quite a lot of reused footage in some scenes (e.g. ""background"" characters getting killed twice in the exact same footage during bear fight scenes). 
 
There isn't a great deal to be said about the sound either. The opening theme, while cheesy, is very catchy and enjoyable. The voice cast do a decent to good job, nothing spectacular, but nothing overly terrible either. 
 
--- 
 
In conclusion, GNG is a good shounen series with the main set of characters unusually being of the furry variety. It doesn't do too much that we haven't already seen before, but that doesn't prevent it from being a fun watch. And, despite its fairly unoriginal basic premise, it still remains a very unique series in its own right. I've truly never seen an anime quite like GNG before, even when the general formula feels very familiar. 
 
The series has many flaws, but these are easy to overlook just by how sheer enjoyable it is to watch. It may not be for everyone, but the series is worth a shot if you're interested in any of the following: Dogs, slightly darker ""children's"" shows, shounen/adventure anime or Western animated shows/movies such as the Lion King.

    This review contains light spoilers: 
 
Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata has your typical RomCom harem set up...but is there more than meets the eye? I certainly think so. 
Enter Tomaya Aki an Otaku down to the very core that has a confrontation only seen in fairy tales. In order to capture this moment eternally he makes it his sole mission to make the best Visual Novel that anyone has ever gotten their hands on joined by his gang of a tsundere, kuudere, and his blank canvas of a main heroine. 
 
Story/Character: 
 I'm going to go ahead and start this break down with what I easily enjoyed the most. Branching off of the vague description of the characters I gave prior if you have seen shows such as OreImo this group of characters may not seem that unique at first glance. However, I was pleased to see that over the course of the show we were delivered with detailed back stories for each character and how they tie back to the main giving them more incentive to reach the final goal. The set up of their development really leaves you in a pinch trying to choose your favorite 
 The story over I felt was very clever and it reminded me why I love anime and the otaku culture so much. Seeing Megumi develop as a otaku herself brought back nostalgic memories from High School sharing my favorite animes and introducing more than one friend into a culture that soon became a big part of their lives.  
 
Art/Sound: 
The art for this anime is very vibrant and appealing to look at. I never found myself at a loss of what was happening on screen and many scenes were accented with a unique filter. All of the small details that referenced different anime made the overall environment fun. The sound for this one is something I can't say drew me in, but it certainly didn't have any major faults. The highlight of the music was definitely a shout out to a certain famous anime at the end but I will leave that for your viewing pleasure! 
 
Overall: 
If you are a fan of animes like OreImo, Oregairu, or Toradora I am positive you will fall in love with this anime. From beginning to end it consistently delivered interesting episodes and left the next season open for some intense character developments and more light hearted fun!

    One of the , if not the BEST gundam serie ever made AND aired on t.v ( at least in the western world it was HUGE), this is just one of those long franchise wich has an serie that stands out, revolutionair mecha-designs, good char. introductions and yep what else: it was handdrawn anime. Storywise i really liked it, such an unusual plot and tere is little traditional animation , more mature animation like, and those 5 boys are just manly, not anime kiddo's who bithching all the time like lots these days

    This third and final installment in the Madoka trilogy might seems to live up to it's predecessor at first glance but in the end it is a total disappointment. This review will not be without spoilers so may whoever that read it be warned. 
 
I'll start with the good points of this movie and will slowly bring the main problems with this movie. 
 
Let's start off with the art. While it may not please everyone, the art has been quite faithful to the actual series. The animation is actually one of the show's strong point, some fight were actually well coordinated even though it came at the cost of a lot of 'quality' shots. 
I am no good judge when it comes to music so instead of trying to write a bunch of technical nonsense I'll just say that like the first two movies, I enjoyed that aspect of the movie. The sound aspect is pretty faithful to the last two movies as well so if you enjoyed them, you probably will also enjoy this. 
 
Now let's start with the actual problem of the movies: It destroyed whatever sense the first two movies made. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of Homura becoming an existence that contrast Madoka's, the problem doesn't lie here. The problem is not the end goal of the movie but the path they took to reach it. 
The movie start in a weird world where we can easily associate elements that were present in the two others installments. Characters that shouldn't be there are there, things that should have happened didn't happen (and vice versa)... this world is a complete mess. It doesn't make sense for a while until we learn that this world was a labyrinth, we then learn that Homura created that world. That part of the story actually made a lot of sense. 
Homura, more than anyone, wished for a world where she could live happily with Madoka and, additionally, their other friends. She is the person that rewind-ed time so many time while enduring so much pain in order to save her friend. Even if she wanted to uphold Madoka's laws it would be easy to see how she could desire such a world. 
By the time we learn about these fact there was already an element that didn't quite make sense: Sayaka's and Bebe's existence. Madoka's wish as a magical girl was to erase every witch before they 'hatched' be it in the past or the future or even in a complete different dimension, nothing less but nothing more. That request created a paradox that rewrote the world's rules and gave form to Madoka's wish as a system. Technically Madoka's existence became close to a 'god' but she isn't a god. She isn't supposed to be an omnipotent being that can decide to send some follower at her whim. She became a system which can only destroy witches before they hatch, a system that lost it's individuality and it's will. 
It would be one thing if Sayaka and Bebe were created from Homura's labyrinth but they are following straight order from Madoka and that is outside her actual capacity, but that's the less important problem. 
 
The main problem is Homura suddenly being able to rewrite the laws Madoka made. It can hardly be said to be anything else than an asspull.  
Homura's desire to save Madoka created many different timeline in which Madoka was the center. The reason for these world to exist to begin with is Madoka and nothing else. That's why every time Homura rewind-ed the time, Madoka's latent potential as a witch grew since a witch's power is representative of it's importance in the world. Madoka being the reason of many world's existence possess a power with no precedent, at least nothing that Homura should be able to interfere with.  
That's when, on the premise of love, the show destroyed whatever little sense it made. 
I doubt I need to explain myself over why this doesn't make any sense. One isn't able to do whatever he wants simply because he wants to. The first two movies clearly expressed that there are thing that people are helpless against, a world where despair exist. The storyteller created a world where things are tied together and make at the very least some kind of sense. Homura couldn't suddenly defeat Walpurgisnacth because she wanted to. Once turned into a witch, there is no way to save a girl. Someone will not necessary return your kindness because you decided to be kind to him. It's not One piece where people can become stronger out of willpower alone, power and will are two completely separate entities. Yet they decided to take the route where Homura could do whatever she wanted because 'power of love'. 
 
It's disappointing to see the story ending this way, it could have been handled much better than that. The movie in itself was enjoyable to watch but  as a piece in the trilogy it is a huge disappointment.

This anime was boring, really I was wondering, that maybe in another episode story will go faster and it will skip these onion try-hard-cutting moments. 
After that I watched these anime series I still wonder why I didn't drop it before... 
*Story is boring, really...I was half sleeping. 
*Artworks weren't something special, many mistakes, but it isn't horrible. It is something more than average, newer style, but still too poor. 
*Characters were strange, because idiots is bad word. In first episodes I just couldn't accept those heroes, so there is another minus. There was another thing, which was spoiled - inside problems of one character shouldn't be problem of whole 5 characters. These problems were taking time for months if it would be good with that awesome chronological system of fable. 
*Music was probably the best of that anime, that piano was many times very good. 
Supernatural ideas were good too, but it was too small amount of them! 
 
I wonder how that anime would look like, if it would be created in shoujo art theme.

At the time, I was all for romance anime and I was looking for some good romance anime after completing another romance/comedy not too long ago. Let me tell you, this anime pulled me in on its first episode and I COULD NOT wait for the next episode the next week. After a while you already know how the anime will go, but you will believe something can somehow change and you will believe it until the very end and the ending is rewarding. It is an anime that will make you cry. The relationship the main characters have is so touching and the anime is able to add humor in the relationship and it all fits in. I loved every minute of the anime and all I cherished every moment of the anime. I wish it could be longer.  
 
The supporting characters are also very good and they fit in very well and make the anime enjoyable and a fun time. There was one character who had a liked another character, but later on, they did nothing to develop it and seemed to drop it. It didn't really affect the story too much so it was fine. Another problem with the anime is the fact that it was advertised as a ""sci-fi"" as well as drama and romance, but the anime HAS ""sci-fi"" elements, but doesn't focus that much on ""sci-fi"" that much which may mislead some viewers. 
 
Overall, this anime was very touching. The opening fits the anime VERY well and sets the tone for the anime. I still listen to the opening to this day. I loved every character in the anime and the relationship between the main character and the girl was touching and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a romance story that will make you smile, laugh, and cry all at the same time. I felt like something great was learned each episode and I loved how the different characters evolved overtime. This is definitely my favorite anime as of now by far.

    I can see why many think that this anime is one of the best off all time.  
I really do. Awesome characters, great music, a cool world, interesting philosophical questions...  An anime truly for adults which avoids many of those typical anime cliches. It has also one of the best/most memorable scene I've seen ever in an anime. (Session 5) 
 
Why is it still not a 10/10 Masterpiece? 
 
The overall story was really lacking which prevented me to be more involved with the characters. And most of of the episodes where just good.  
 
Still its a classic who every anime fan should watch.

    Zankyou no Terror is an anime I really enjoyed. It kept me coming back for more episode after episode. 
 
I really enjoyed the well thought out plot, which puts this anime above the few I've watched before. The characters are really cool as you somewhat get an attached feeling towards them as you progress through the anime. 
 
I feel that the anime could have had another episode which would've explained the orphanage and the other subjects. 
 
All in all, I really enjoyed this anime.

    The long awaited sequel to the Youjo Senki series, this movie brings in a new character and antagonist to light. Once again, our sociopathic salaryman loli finds herself in a complex predicament reminiscent of our world’s historical world wars, facing the interference of being x at the worst possible times. Like the original series, Tanya’s squad 203 sets out to face enemies that appears impossible to win against, according to their political and strategic heads, and the battles are reflective of the nature of difficulty. 
 
In this movie, we are shown a more emotional side of Tanya. There are some scenes in the movie where she even has “human” moments, which is a stark contrast to her original series presentation. You can look forward to some subtle times of hesitation on the battlefield for reasons you’ll have to watch the movie to find out about. If you watch carefully, you may even notice some moments of increased leniency towards her men. This movie seems to prepare for a new season where the anime begins to dissect her as a character. For some reason, Tanya also makes a ton of communist jokes throughout the movie, which made the people in my theater laugh a lot. (Something tells me the plot's writer really dislikes communists) 
 
The graphics were pretty much the same as the original series graphics with no real addition in quality that I noticed. Like I said in my original review of the series, they’re pretty good overall and I’d give them an 8/10.  
 
The only difference between the characters in the series and the characters in the movie is the new main antagonist who appears to be what the next season will focus on. 
 
Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the first season. This is not a recap and is all fresh material, so you will need to watch the original series in order to understand what is happening in this movie.  
 
Watch it!

    I can only assume this is a product of Keiichi Tanaami discovering “Alice in Wonderland” and thinking to himself, “You know what this story could use?  Lots of eyes all over the place.”  And then “Adventures in Beauty Wonderland” was born.   
 
Like everything Tanaami touches, this is a bit strange.  But unlike a great deal of things he’s touched, this one’s relatively easy on the eyes.  And that’s not a pun on the emphasis of eyes in this film.  What I mean by easy on the eyes isn’t that the art isn’t ugly, but it’s not an attempt on the life of some poor epileptic.  If anything, it’s an attack on the ears.  Pretty much any time someone or something blinks, there’s a high-pitched ding sound.   Thankfully, we have volume control for that. 
 
There isn’t much in the way of plot, it’s mostly just what I assume is supposed to represent Alice going through a series of bizarre set pieces.  Most of the backgrounds and characters have this collage look to them, like something out of some twisted Reading Rainbow episode.  I personally think it would make for a great artbook. 
 
Now normally I’m not much of a fan of Tanaami, but I actually like this one.  Not sure why, but it just resonates with me.  I doubt many share my opinion, considering the average rating, but I’d recommend it to someone trying to get into the experimental list-bloater side of MAL.

    Naruto Shippuuden 
 
Story(9) 
Well, to begin with, the main thing is still the same as in Naruto: Getting Sasuke back. But, the difference is that there are new enimies, some which you've already seen and really fight now and some you haven't which makes the story a lot more interesting. And there are some new good guys as well. Of course there are fillers(the makers of Naruto seem to do that a lot) but they are still beter than the ones in Naruto and really have a story. But....at episode 90, there starts a filler which is very boring(till 94). They could have done it in 2, maybe 1 episode, but they have to put in in 4 or 5 episodes, and when you have to wait one week, and you know that the coming episode will be boring, well, it sucks. But don't skip it, because it still is cool. And it's a lot better when you can get through it in a few days. 
 
Art(9) 
The art is nearly the same as in Naruto and it is still very good. Everything is done very good and looks nice, and makes the action feel a lot more reel. 
 
Sound(9) 
There are some new sounds in Naruto Shippuuden, but they sound-alike a lot. And the sounds in Naruto were good, so these are too.  
 
Character(9) 
As I had already said, there are some new, cool characters and of course you have the old ones. A very good thing is that they are introduced one by one, and not all at once. That keeps it a little mystery. You just want to know how they look like and what kind of new things they all can do. A very good thing about Naruto Shippuuden is, that not only Naruto is in the spotlight. other characters get a chance as well. 
 
Enjoyment(10) 
Naruto was the first anime I've ever watched, so I couldn't wait to start watching Naruto Shipuuden. And I didn't, because they had already made like 40 episodes or something. xD Just as in Naruto there will be a lot of fighting and training, what is even better than in Naruto(sometimes) and what makes it really great to watch. 
 
Overall(9) 
Well, I can only say that Naruto Shippuuden is a great anime and that the fillers are good as well, so don't be scared by that. ;P

    Amazing! just amazing. I think no words can do justice to this masterpiece. I usually like romance but  there were times when this anime made me cry, Such an emotional roller coaster!   
It never lets you get bored, though at at episode 9 it felt as though the story ended but it was fine. 
 
Story-10 
The story hooks you up right from the first episode and never lets you get bored. It's a really well paced story as well as a deep story.  
 
Art- 10  
Again, the art is really amazing. The character designs, both male and female are amazing. Even the background sceneries like mountains, farms, countryside, flowers are amazing. This is what Kyoto Animation does; always outdo itself.  
 
Sound -10 
The OST's were so good that they were at par with the Fate series OST's. The OST's are so well timed with the emotion that the result may make you tear up.  
 
Character-10 
The character developement is amazing, so are the character introductions.

    Based on a classic novel, Gankutsuou tells the story of a man bent on revenge and the boy he changes the life of. The first episode of the series introduces the Count of Monte Cristo, a man with power, influence, and a real sense of danger about him. Albert, a teenager who has his share of power and influence, although not much knowledge of who he really is or can be. At its core, the story is a rite of passage for Franz as he learns about life, people, and what it means to be an adult. In addition, though, many other topics are covered: the romantic lives of Franz and his friends, for example. And, more importantly, the true nature and history of the Count, and how this ties into Franz and his own life and history. 
 
Initially, one of the most notable things about this series is the art style. Instead of things (mostly hair and clothing) being colored and shaded as they would be traditionally, bright, busy patterns are used. When characters move, the pattern usually will not move with them, almost as if certain areas of the character were cut out and moved in front of a static pattern. It seems awkward at first, but is fairly easy to adapt to as the series goes on. Ultimately, this becomes a likable aspect, not a downfall. Watching things as simple as a character turning his or her head becomes more interesting to watch, and the atmosphere seems very rich because of the lack of solid colors. A bit overwhelming? Perhaps, but very worth the while. 
 
The background music also adds to the atmosphere well. The creators really knew how to add emphasis to a scene with the right music, or lack thereof. The same cannot be said of the opening theme, however, which has lackluster lyrics and an unskilled vocalist. The closing is much better, although the rapid-paced closing animation paired with the fast song has perhaps a bit too much happening. Nonetheless, the song is quite good, as is the music overall. 
 
What stands out the most in this excellent series is the characters. Every single one of them is amazingly complex, with their own personality, motivations, and journey. Take the main character, Franz, as an example. At first glance, he seems like a fairly normal teen, though perhaps a bit too trusting. Over the course of the series, little things are reveled about him. He develops insecurities about the world around him; his positive traits help him; his negative traits hurt him; he makes mistakes and learns. And, unlike some series, it is not just the main characters that grow: it is all of them. The cast of Gankutsuou might just be the richest one in anything I have ever seen. 
 
The one notable element of the series that really bothered me is the ending. Not the content of the ending itself, mind you, but rather that the climax seemed rather misplaced. The most emotional, and, in my opinion, best, episodes are in the late teens and early twenties rather than at the end. In addition, the final battle ends in the second-to-last episode, so the entire last episode is solely resolution. While resolution is important, this series has a little too much, especially since it mainly reinforces what we already can infer about the character's futures. Still, this is a minor complaint and my only real one in regards to my enjoyment of the show. 
 
If it seems that I have been describing the series rather than pointing out its good and bad points, that is because there are not many specific pluses and minuses to speak of. Rather, every element of Gankutsuou blends together to create a fantastic story about living, growth, and revenge.

The both, idea of the story and  story itself are great, the flashbacks in their places, the way it runs is great, you can't find a story that similar to it nott just in content but in the way ot runs too. 
 
Art   ""9"" 
You can find the art of this so great but the way the chiropterans drawn wasn't my favourite, to all other stuff it well drawn.  
 
Characters   ""8"" 
They are great but Saya's actions so predictable, also others some kind predictable, and since this is a mystery anime some actions must be surprising or misunderstandable (is this a word?). 
But the way charecters effect each other is nice so I give 8. 
 
Enjoyment   ""8"" 
This anime is so great except the stupid fillers that don't give any meaning, like many of half episodes, actually if they deleted those fillers the anime maybe become more intresting and mysterious.  
 
And for sounds I give full mark since I watched it Russian Dubbed 
 
When add all the marks together and devide on five we'll get the overall rating of the anime   ""9"" 
 
Was nice 3 nights I watched the anime through, please mark as useful, and I'll catch you next time with new anime.

        You know how sometimes things will be so bad they're good? 
     
   Well, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is so incredibly over-the-top, cliched, and, at some points, down right idiotic, that it's fucking great. The entire series revolves around fighting an enemy, losing to said enemy, but then, magically, finding a solution and winning! This enormous plot hole(s) is covered up with the use of some bullshit ""Spiral Power.""  
     
    However, this all works out in its advantage. The flaws, somehow, morph into a form of complete badass-ery. The testosterone constantly seeps from beginning to end. 
      
    Now, it may seem like I hated TTGL, but it's quite the opposite: I thoroughly enjoyed it. Go watch it. You'll most likely like it, the four of you who haven't seen it. 
 
    So, it has a shitty story, cheesy dialogue, loads of fan service, and several other problems. Nonetheless, I loved every minute of it.

    *No Spoiler Concise Review* 
TL;DR: If Chicken Run the movie ever became animated and instead of chickens you have humans and instead of farmers you have demons then this would be the ultimate anime adaptation your sadist soul had been looking for all this time.  
[Story: 8/10 , Characters: 7/10, Art: 8/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 9/10] 
 
What is Yakusoku no Neverland you may ask? Why it's merely a slice of life about cutesy looking orphan kids... but it's actually a literal slice of life anime. Confused? Shook? Mate, you ain't even feeling woke yet. Going into this anime completely blind of the plot really sets you up for a fun series filled with endless cliff-hangers & heart attacks. If you look at the cover art, it's literally kids being served on a fine dining plate with posh cutleries. If that doesn't give you any hint on what kind of show this could be, then sit down, time to educate you on this phenomenal show of Winter 2019 brought to us by Studio Cloverworks.  
 
Normally it takes about three episodes to get someone hooked on a show. The way this anime ends the first episode immediately has you hooked; similar to how SnK had you hooked. You are initially introduced to these Einstein level kids with super brain power, nursed and brought up by Mama (Loving Motherly Caretaker), innocently playing tag in this orphan house. Whenever the kids become of age, they are sent off to ""Neverland"" because they are old enough to be adopted. Doesn't that sound sweet to you? Wrong. Turns out this orphan house is a Brain Farm, where they are harvesting kids till their brain becomes prime meal for anteater looking demons living in the outside world. Ready to turn vegan yet? Fortunately for our genius kids, they discover this truth and now the game of tag begins between them and their conniving evil Mama.  Will the kids be able to escape this ranch or will they become fodder for the demons? Are you hooked yet? If not, read on.  
 
""You always feel lonely every time you get sick. I didn’t want you to feel sad. "" ~ Emma 
 
The major characters of this show really stands out from one another. They are all geniuses but differ in their respective personality. The major characters are Norman, the mastermind that knows how to coexist, Emma, the happy go lucky girl that just wants everyone to be happy and lastly Ray, the edgiest selfish boy you will ever meet. Juxtaposing all three of their personality you have Mama on the opposite spectrum, who just smirks at the kids trying to be all sneaky while foiling each of their plots. It's very reminiscent of when we were kids and trying to pull a fast one over our parents but it always failed because they were always ten steps ahead of us. However, unlike us, these kids seemingly possess 200 level IQ. It's exhilarating to watch them play 5D chess with each other. Besides them, you have side characters like Don and Gilda who are your token overtly emotional whipping boys who abides by the plan till they screw up. It's interesting to note, design wise, the kids and the toddlers seems to have similar looks phenotype wise. It could be that they are probably from a similar gene pool; after all it is a farm. Lastly, the stand out character of this show, is this little boy named, Phil. Keep your eyes on Phil because I don't trust that kid one bit. He always pops up in the most strangest scenarios. There is another Mama but that's a surprise for only show watchers to experience.   
 
""The person you see before you is the strongest card you have"" ~ Ray 
 
Aside from the exhilarating plot and dynamic characters, the art and animation of this show did justice to the Manga. Studio Cloverworks maybe a small studio but seeing what an awesome job they have done animating and giving life to this show is truly breathtaking. The panels are vibrant, the animation is smooth and the director really knows how to play around with lighting to evoke dread and despair in every scene in the show. Not too much to complain. There are some CG moments but mostly blended CG not too noticeable to the viewers.  Moreover, the OST is just amazing. Both the OP and ED songs are just outright bangers. Definitely worth a listen as a standalone. Lastly, special shoutout to the amazing seiyuus working on this show, particularly, Maaya Uchida (Norman), Sumire Morohoshi (Emma) and Mariya Ise (Ray). They just heightened the personality of these kids to the next level and fans of HxH 2011 and FMAB would recognize the familiar voice.  
 
""I want to do the things that'll make Emma happy...because I love her. I won't let her die."" ~ Norman 
 
Overall, I am so glad this was a sleeper OP hit to start of 2019. After shows like Made in Abyss and SnK leaving the empty feeling of seeing cutesy looking characters in grievous danger, the inner sadism in most of us will feel satisfied watching this awesome show. The plot is unpredictable, the characters are multi-dimensional and both the animation & OST do justice to accentuate this show to a greater level. I would definitely recommend watching this anime and I'm happy to hear this anime is getting a second season. Good luck not reading the manga and waiting for the sequel.  Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how you found this anime!  
 
P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful! 
P.P.S. In Japan, Tag is known as ""onigokko,"" and the person we refer to as ""it"" is called the ""oni"" in Japanese which of course, is a demon.

    This will be the last time I forcefully shove in episodes of a horrible anime. I feel ashamed at this point that my friends kept spamming me to ""keep watching, it gets realllllly good"". Toward the end of it, I felt nauseous and eventually fastforwarded the episodes. 
 
You know, I liked this anime when it first started airing. The first couple episodes showed great promise. The premises were fresh - a complex fantasy setting mixed in with a time-travel-upon-death mechanic similar to what you see in a video game. I was genuinely interested to see what happens next to our stereotypical dysfunctional teenage MC.  
 
However, it didn't take long for the settings to backfire on the overly ambitious writers. Because the majority of the show-time was taking the character back to his original checkpoint, the story itself was constantly repeating the same scenes over and over again, along with the character relationships. I'm certain that the writers are aware of this, so they tried to compensate by accelerating the plot's pace and that's when the problems began setting in.  
 
The characters ""developed"" bonds that I consider to be creepy and unnatural. They have only met each other for a short time (largely due to the death-reset mechanic) , and for some reason they act like they're willing to do anything for one another.  
 
Now, that doesn't sound too horrible, I suppose. Until the scenes kicked in. Yes, I'm talking about the torture hentai. At this point in time, I can't help but wonder: is shock the only thing people value from a story? The only thing shocking I found was seeing how people in the comment section responded to these scenes. They were either praising the gore, or circle-jerking about how sad the scenes were. Really? These characters came straight out of no where, with no history or even a visible personality, and people are going crazy over their ""deaths"". At this point, I realized why this anime have such a high rating at MAL. The writers identified what gets people going, and showed no restraint in overflowing the entire anime with them. Gore, psychological tantrums, moe characters, then just fit all those into a random medieval fantasy world and you got a winning recipe! ...right? 
 
Maybe it didn't work for me because I never found myself head-over-toes over the personality nor the looks of the female cast like many others have. I mean, I've seen people spam Emelia-tan and Rem-chan in real life and I just shudder and pretend I didn't hear it. The writers want to tug at people's heartstrings by torturing the female characters (whom half the guys are jerking their chode off to as I speak), but even when they died, I honestly felt nothing. Okay maybe a little sympathy, but I was mostly feeling sick from the excessive gore that had very little substance. The story was progressing but it had no direction. The characters apart from Subaru, are likable but strangers to me. I felt no connections to them because they told me very little of themselves.  
 
Oh, did I call Subaru unlikable? I did? Ok good I was afraid I forgot about him, though at this point I wish I could. There is an alarmingly high amount of people defending Subaru as ""one of us"" and justifying his actions as natural as anyone of us would have acted. I honestly felt offended. Subaru's dialogue consists of ""anything I'd do for EMEEEELIAAA-TAAAAN"" to ""no one understands anything. I'm edgy and I will save everyone. WTF WHY ISN'T ANYONE HELPING ME?!"". It's mind-boggling how someone can be so useless and despicable as Subaru. I don't sympathize with him, or the way he addresses the people around him. He has this blatant superiority complex that is atrocious to watch. Despite having no abilities (not in the fantasy world nor his old world), he openly treats others as obstacles holding him back from ""saving everyone"". He is never content, and will always find something to snarl at. It's astonishing how anyone can relate to this ignorant boy. Perhaps the people praising Subaru are the same people who wants to justify their own attitude towards life - arrogant and ungrateful.  
 
If Subaru showed even a tiny bit of restraint, and not clogging up 90% of his lines with either otaku slangs or emo comments, I might've gave the anime a passing score. But even then, the show is too occupied with stale violence and Subaru's edgy soliloquy.  
 
Art is nice. Music and sound are alright. Not enough to salvage a horribly written and executed anime. 
 
2/10.

    The story is pretty interesting, though the anime sadly lacks compared to the beautiful manga from CLAMP. They cut so much out and yet seemed to add things to it that were not in the original manga. In that way, it loses a lot of the meaning behind it. The story line isn’t really all that new, something we have seen a lot in media where humanoid robots take over the world, being built to be peoples slaves and sometimes sexually created. Then suddenly one goes crazy. 
 
It’s not only in the anime but the manga as well that Chi’s restart and turn on button is her… privet place. It makes it rather creepy and pretty perverted. This whole show has a lot of fan service that isn’t in the manga which just makes things even worse. Another strange thing that happened to the anime is that the numbers got a bit odd when they brought it over. It happened from the 9th episode up. You see, the 9th episode was supposed to be actually a half episode called 8.5 instead. It was a recap…and the same goes for episode 20 which was supposed to be 18.5. Now I have to ask… why do we need this many recaps for a 26 episode series? I mean, we really aren’t that dumb and it does get really old. And even more bothersome is that there is actually a 27th (24.5) episode that was unaired and is only shown as on the DVD! You can guess what I’m going to say about that… its another bloody RECAP! Like we need one after the last show has aired! And because its on the DVD, it feels very stupid on their part because the person watching was probably marathon the show to begin with… 
 
The comical part is actually pretty funny and the only Romance I see is Hideki’s problems with women. It’s rather bothersome sometimes. He just seems really off a lot of the times and though they give him a good reason to be, it just makes him like every other character in a harem anime. It’s a bit annoying because he doesn’t seem to have his own characteristics. 
 
Unfortunately, the same goes for Chi and her strange personality. She’s like a little child who doesn’t know anything at all and a lot of times, it just feels really annoying. She just has no real emotions for most of the show and when she does show them, it’s rather sad or really happy. I would have at least liked to show her mad at one point. 
 
The art style is beautiful, no duh, it is clamp that first created it and the style matches the manga pretty damn well. Unfortunately, it also has its downsides with how flat the faces look and you don’t really see their noses well when they are looking right at you. The mouths are rather small and every once in a while, you will get a character that has a chibifide expression but otherwise, it’s rather plain. The women’s hair normally is what looks the most beautiful. 
 
The voices are alright, some work well and others in both the English and Japanese dub are not that good. Chi is really cute but her voice hurts my ears when I have to listen to her for long periods at a time like when she is walking down the street saying underpants. It’s funny, but ugg… my ears!

    A fun anime that could go well with younger audiences but successfully brings warm feelings of hope and wonder to even older viewers like myself.  I've never actually written a review for an anime before, but I felt compelled to write a review of this amazing and unique series and encourage others to watch Little Witch Academia (LWA). 
 
Let's start with the individual aspects: 
Story - 9/10 
The overall plot of the story is rather simplistic, especially in the beginning - a young witch who struggles to realize her dream of being like her idol, and who despite her weaknesses somehow manages to shine and do things that others couldn't.  Indeed the producers don't make much of an effort to hide their foreshadowing and many parts of the story are quite predictable, but the story writers manage to make each episode an exciting, fun, and adventurous story on their own.  True, each episode doesn't pack as much plot as a single OVA (after all, an OVA is relatively short compared to a 25 episode series) but this enabled the story to progress at a comfortable pace and to develop the characters and the plot in a more nuanced fashion.  For the uncanny way LWA manages to turn a simple plot into something exciting, while interweaving themes about pursuing one's dream, friendship, and change, I give this series a 9. 
 
Art - 10/10 
Full disclaimer - I'm in love with Studio Trigger's artwork.  Kill La Kill was the first work I had seen by this studio and above anything, it was the artwork that had captivated me.  LWA continues to uphold the high standard set by Trigger's previous works.  Their ability to capture action through different contrasts, to capture a variety of nuanced facial expressions (and combine it with superb voice acting) is simply mesmerizing.  The artwork does an excellent job of setting the mood and air for the story, with dark scenes that evoke feelings of mystery punctuated with the green sparkles of magic that evoke awe and wonder. I could go on with examples from the series, but it'll probably be best to see the series for yourself. 
 
Sound - 8/10 
The openings/endings were pretty awesome, though not particularly noteworthy, in my opinion.  I really liked the first and second openings.  The first seemed to evoke feelings of hope, childish naivete, and magical wonder, while the second seemed more serious, and mature (but maybe it's just me).  For it being good but not outstanding, I give the sound an 8. 
 
Character - 9/10 
The characters in LWA were amazing.  Trigger does an excellent job of giving each main character a very distinct personality, even right from the first episode.  This is accomplished through excellent artwork that captures the personality of each character through their character design, color pallet, facial expressions, right down to their movements, and the superb voice acting.  Character development was especially amazing - I don't want to give any spoilers, but one particular character's development is particular striking - she is given far more development in the TV series and becomes a completely different character than we would have ever expected from the original OVAs.  That's all I'll say. 
 
Enjoyment - 10/10 
It comes as no surprise that I absolutely enjoyed (and adore) LWA.  The execution of the ideas is simply amazing, and every episode is its own adventure and packed with hilarious jokes, references, and humor. 
 
Overall - 10/10 
It's rare that something like LWA, a simple story involving young schoolgirl witches (who sorta save the world, but not really) could turn into something so amazing and enjoyable.  The art and acting work together so well to give amazing characters and a fun, exciting plot.  I definitely recommend people to watch LWA, and even if the beginning seems a bit slow at first, realize that it's all setup for more interesting developments that happen later on.  Proof that even a more lighthearted story about young characters in school can be a true masterpiece.

    If Jim Jarmusch directed anime, this is the type of movie he'd make.  To it's benefit it cuts to the heart of the characters much like a Jarmusch film with slow, long deliberate takes, with a good deal of silence and sadness.  I think one of my favorite scenes was when Takuya and Sayuri are riding the train together for the first time and the just sort of stand there, with each other in one of the best and most realistic depictions of thirteen year-old's I've ever seen on screen.  The animations is beautiful, and even the framing, catching them off center, and from a distance, adds to a slight melancholy that is palpable throughout most of the film.  
 
It has a few really great scenes like that which float around, almost dreamlike in the first half of the film.  It's slow, and a bit novelistic, letting us see the reality these three kids inhabit, easing us along at their pace instead of our own. 
 
The problems arise in the latter half of the film, when too much is devoted to voice over narration explaining how each character feels instead of giving us the same sort of interesting scenes in the beginning which showed us how they felt.  It loses that intimate feel it had and gives us half realized politics and sci-fi that really doesn't explain anything, a Macguffin that pulls you out of the plot instead of pulling you in like it's supposed to.  The sci-fi elements are only supposed to be incidental to these characters, a means to tell a story about love, youth, alienation, and innocence lost.  But too much of the story revolves around the tower and the sci-fi alternate reality bits to leave it as completely mysterious and unexplained as they did.  Specifically why it's affecting Sayuri specifically (the fact her grandfather built it really isn't much of an explanation, or at least not a good one for a point around which the whole plot is built), is never answered making you feel as if you only really got half the story. 
 
The whole affair loses focus after the three main characters separate and go or are forced to go their own ways.  From that moment on it ceases to be a story we are experiencing with the characters on the screen and turns in to a story that's forced upon us in a way incongruent with the simplicity, and focus of the first half.

    The best way to describe this anime, is that the music and soundtrack is bloody awesome. Mixed that in with such an interesting world and concept, and you get a really unique anime. (The Video Review is up on my channel, here is the written) 
 
Story - 8/10 
 
Kekkai Sensen is set in an alternative reality of New York. There was a huge explosion between Earth and the Netherworld with New York caught in the middle. This explosion brought beings from the netherworld to Earth. Now normally with these type of storylines, they tend to follow the path as a alien invasion, however that is not the case in this. Instead of that the visitors and earthlings live with each other in harmony, for most cases. Because like Earth, the Netherworld has it’s criminals as well. The story follows mostly Leonardo Watch, who is a member of a crime fighting organization known as Libra, are group of people trying to bring balance to the two worlds, by fighting against whatever crime that involves both worlds.  
 
With such a unique and interesting concept, there is one thing that the writers must do. And that is the world building. For such a unique world, I guess they explained as best as they can. Because they explain how most the powers, the characters have and their backstories are explained fairly well. However the world building in general, explaining the lores and how things work, could’ve been done better, as there a times where you will have no idea what is going on. And this comes in with the pacing, the pacing jumps around, sometimes it’s quite fast and feels rushed, and sometimes it just really slows down and when that happens it’s hard to keep track of what’s going, because the constant changes in pace. One minute they’re discussing something, the next they are all suddenly in a rush to save the world. However despite these problems, the story is very nice and touching, with some thrills here and there, and it has a pretty good ending. It’s just that it’s confusing and hard to follow.  
 
Characters - 8/10 
 
There is a lot of characters in Kekkai Sensen, and like a lot of shows with a lot of characters, a lot of them don’t get development and are kind of there for a unique character to be introduce each episode. The main protagonist is Leonardo Watch who has the power of the ‘All Seeing Eyes of God’ Which is just as it sounds, it’s the ability to let him see anything, but at the cost of his sister’s eyes. And this brings me to another plot point, Leonardo’s sister is his motivation to gain more courage and find out more about his power and use them for his sister’s sake. Now there is quite a bit of character development from him, as he starts out not trusting the people around, but learns they need him and he needs them to move forward. And you can see the courage he gains by the end of show. However one thing that does bug is, he talks about his sister so much, yet we know nothing about her, and what happened to her afterwards. She sacrificed her sight, and is receiving letters from Leonardo, but we don’t know how much of a role she plays besides an outside motivation for Leonardo.  
 
Like I said previously there is a lot of characters in Kekkai Sensen, too much to go through them all. But there are some they need some attention, especially from Libra Klaus von Reinherz.  At first, Klaus just fills the void for badass cool personality, but as we learn more about him. We see why he fights and where does his morals lie. We see him protecting those in his organization and trying to understand the enemy which I love about his character. There are two other characters they play an important role in the story and they are the twins White and Black. Now these characters are a key mystery to the overall plot, so I’m not going to spoil anything, but their story just hits you in the feels and they have such good interactions with the main characters. 
 
Animation and Sound - 9/10, 10/10 
 
The art style its feels very mature and gritty. There is not a lot of colours, and it really highlights the urban city of this alternative New York, which really works for this type of setting. It makes you feel right there, at the moment, and pair that up with the soundtrack which I will get into later. The designs of each character feels really refreshing and unique and I like how they were able to blend it the netherworld inhabitants with the humans and not making it completely stand out with one another, as they all share this world. The action scenes and the way they use their blood powers is really nice to look at, although it can be a bit simple at times, as in they’ll use their blood powers but then a big text words come up, and it’s suddenly explosions, not really that impressive sometimes. The action scenes are good, but not all them have the same quality of high animation. And this comes in with a problem with some of the pacing changes when scenes changes, it’s hard to follow at times, and some scenes look simpler than the others. 
 
I can’t finish this review without talking about the soundtrack. Because as I said in my top 25 anime of 2015, it hands down has the best soundtrack of the year. The combination of jazz and blues music really add to Broadway atmosphere of this alternative reality of New York. It’s amazing, the vocals and the instrumentals are just beautiful to listen to, and it adds so much to the scene and you can listen to it on its own, without needing the world that it was made for. Also the soundtrack isn’t the only thing great about the sound in general. The opening song is wonderful to listen to and the animation is nice, I kind of regret not putting it higher on my top openings of the year list. But maybe because the ending song was just on a league of its own. I was always looking forward to when the get to the ending song, because it’s an upbeat catchy tune of a song with awesome animation which made it feel like a Broadway spectacle, with the cast of characters dancing to the beat, and it was probably my favourite song of the year. Hands best soundtrack of the year. 
 
Enjoyment - 8/10 
 
The concept and world of Kekkai Sensen, had me really interested in this anime. I really enjoyed the characters and the way they interact in this alternative reality, but my enjoyment can only go so far as when I’m trying understand on what they’re trying to pull off. Because some things aren’t explained all that clearly and the way story jumps around, it’s confusing. Oh yeah, I haven’t mention the comedy in this show, I think it’s pretty good well timed comedy, has good timing and doesn’t really distract away from some of the scenes too much, that being said it’s not laugh out loud funny, but still pretty good for a quick giggle. And you will be surprised by the amount of comedy in the anime. But I just love listening to the music, and the ending song just got him hyped up for more episodes just to watch the ending song. 
 
Verdict - 8.5/10 
 
As we draw closer to the end of the review, I give the story an 8. Because despite its pacing problems and some confusion in the story once in a while. The whole entire premise and concept kept me interested for the whole time it was running. And the overall story was touching and an epic thrill ride.  
 
For the animation and sound, I give it a 8 and 10. The animation and art style is fine. They did a really good job recreating the alternative New York. The action scenes were great only they kept a good quality for all of them rather than having some of them be pretty simple. The soundtrack like, is by far the best soundtrack of the year. The Jazz and Blues really add to the Broadway atmosphere of the whole show and its wonderfully composed. The opening and ending songs are great, especially the ending, which is my favourite song of the year. 
 
For the characters I give them an 8. I love the characters Leonardo, Klaus, and the twins. And I love their character development. Zapp was an entertaining character as well. Because of the huge cast, I wished we had more time the learn about them, and wish there was more development. And it was disappointing, we didn’t learn too much about Leonardo’s sister. 
 
For my own personal enjoyment I give it an 8. With some confusing and hard to follow story points in the anime, it was hard trying to enjoy those moments, when you don’t understand what is going on. But for the most part the show is really enjoyable, just with the concept alone. The comedy is surprisingly clever and it’s funny how they use it quite often, I did not expect a show called Blood Blockade Battlefront to be quite funny. But the music was just perfect and I loved listening to it, which made the show. 
 
So for the overall of score of Kekkai Sensen after rounding it up, I give it a 8.5/10. It in anime with a very interesting concept and world backed up its wonderful soundtrack, that really just shows how much music can do for an anime. I recommend Kekkai Sensen to those who love to watch Supernatural, Action and those who love to watch Crime Thrillers.

    So guys, this OVA of Toradora tell us a story about how to prepare a bentou. When Kitamura's Grandmother prepares a big bentou for him. Ryuuji starts a competion by himself to prove that he can prepare a great bentou better than Katamura's Grandmother. It is a funny story that if you had a chance to watch it. I really recommend.

    This anime started off really awesome. I was very much impressed by the starting. But the story didn't end as well as it started. In fact I didn't like the ending at all, it seemed quite lame to me, and also the story ended without explaining much about the other characters. 
 
The overall character development was good. The main characters of this anime have been portrayed really good. My favorite character being Stein. And pf course Shinigami's character was awesome. Rikiya Koyama did a great job voicing him. 
 
The animation was very good. The fight sequences were awesome. Reminded me of Bleach fight sequences. :P 
 
Sound was good too. I liked the OSTs and also the music during fights or emotional scenes was great, neither too dramatic nor too subtle. 
 
I enjoyed watching this anime, though I'm much disappointed in the ending. I expected much more since it was a BONES production. Comparing this to FMA:Bhood would be futile because this is nowhere near it. I would recommend watching this, it would be a good entertainment.

    I'm gonna start off by saying I've always hated Infinite Stratos. I was unfortunate to be invited in by the concept alone, expecting some good science-fiction action. I was very upset only to find it to be a very poorly written and generic harem with few redeeming qualities. However, I looked forward to the second season with almost no expectations, only to find that it had slaughtered said redeeming qualities from the first season. 
 
In case you didn't know what Infinite Stratos is all about, let me remind you: It's set in the near future where the eponymous weaponized armors are the norm in military warfare. The only drawback is that only females can pilot them, and so the Infinite Stratos Academy was founded for the sole purpose of training future pilots. However, the main protagonist, Ichika Orimura, is the only male who can pilot an IS. Throw him inside an all-girls school and harem antics ensue. Dumb, cliche harem antics. 
 
That's it. The first season never goes on with that premise because apparently harem is more important. Most harem anime tend to be rather flimsy when it comes to story and plot development, but in Infinite Stratos 2, ""story"" does not even exist. There's a group of terrorists known as Phantom Task who want to kill Ichika and his older sister, Chifuyu, for unexplained reasons. There's a certain plot point with a member of Phantom Task named Madoka, who is revealed to be Chifuyu's evil twin sister and has a vendetta against her for unexplained reason. That's right, ""unexplained reasons"" is pretty much how this entire season runs on. Any plot threads concerning this are left completely unfinished. Wouldn't it be a good idea to actually elaborate on who these guys are and why they're doing bad stuff? According to the writing staff, apparently not. They only take action for about less than two and a half episodes total. All other episodes is basically ""How much can we pander to the viewers' cocks until their nutbladder explodes? I mean, nobody will care about the lack of character and plot when we can give something for our viewers to fap to every week."" A whole season of filler had better writing than this. 
 
Now the characters: First, you got Ichika himself who is just your standard harem protagonist whose about as dense as a brick. Then you got his harem; all but only one or two are nothing but generic cookie cutter stereotypes who has about as much personality as a piece of cardboard. But wait, there's more: They're unique from other harem girls in that they're a multinational harem! So you got the Japanese childhood friend/abusive tsundere, the German girl who hides weapons in her locker, the Chinese tsundere, the English chick, and the French reverse trap. All of them have nothing special about them and they only want Ichika because he's the only male in school. You might as well throw the entire student body at his bones, while you're at it. 
 
Production values are decent for the most part. The music is forgettable, much like the first season. One thing I actually did like about this was the IS designs and the battle scenes. Even if the harem part was badly written, the fight scenes kept me entertained, even if it isn't the major focus as I hoped it would. Unfortunately, harem comes above all else in Infinite Stratos, so the military warfare part is left high and dry. 
 
Infinite Stratos in general is not a good anime, let alone a good harem show. This mistake known as the second season turns it into an unsalvagable, burning wreck. There have been very few good harem anime in this day and age, but this is just another one tossed under the ""pathetic"" pile. And the second season shoved it into the ""worst ever"" pile. If 8-bit were smart, they should save themselves even more embarrassment and don't even bother with greenlighting a third season because it won't fix anything. Instead, just do the right thing and leave Infinite Stratos to die in its own filth.

    Bias & First impression: 
	I was caution to expect too much, for I have not seen many kingdom based plots and the lead male seemed somewhat stereotypically shounen. The first episode did not represent this series at all, on the contrary it was the worst. However if you give up on the first episode you have misjudged the rest of the show. 
	The pace of the show is fast, and things quickly start to pick up, connections are made, and confusions cleared. The reason I continued through was the unexpectedly amazing episode a few in, to be un-numbered for sake of spoiling. There is a mix of the comical duo of Ryner and Ferris that offsets the heavy atmosphere of Sion’s attempt at improving the kingdom of Roland. 
 
Expectation: 6-7 Fine to Good. 
 
Actual: 7 Good 
Episode scores: -,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,9,9,9,10,6,7,7,7 
 
Analysis: 
	Story 
The story is large, fast paced, intertwined with politics, magic, relationships, and wars. They waste no time getting to the core of an event, however at times you can feel like everything is happening a little too fast. Have a rebellion? Well we can discover, plot, and kill them all in 23 minutes if you would like. Important flashback that sets up the plot? Cover those few years in three. A lot of times things happen behind the scenes too. 
This is not exactly complaining however, since they have so much story to tell they picked the most interesting parts. I loved how I was able to immerse myself in the huge cast and plot, and how I could sympathize with every side.  
	The action was great in terms of animation, however there was a lot of ‘convenient’ dark spots, or rather almost any fight that took place indoors was like trying to find your way in the pitch black. It was an important element, and you can expect at least one action scene an episode even though it might be short. 
 
Characters 
There are too many to be able to count. Thankfully you should be able to keep them all straight if I could. The story is face paced so there is plenty of development in their disposition over the course of the show. The villains are loveable, and the heroes are despicable; there is no clear cut good and bad which gives the relationships between everyone more complex. Every character has motive, personality, and significance in a sense. 
	The only possible annoyance in this was Sion’s and Ryner’s unjustifiable friendship. Their promise holds such significance to them that it doesn’t seem to fit in the dark realistic plot in which they are set. I think they attempt to explain this, but I don’t believe it revealed itself to anyone. 
 
Conclusion: 
	My attention was on and off; there were a few episodes early on that caught me along for the rest of the season. I didn’t really enjoy the first half as much as I would have liked, but with this type of story there is a lot of buildup needed in order for things to get heated. Yet the last half was awesome as many of those scenarios came to a climax (as you can see from my scores). From the stereotypical hero who only wants to take his afternoon naps, to the bloody carnage of the alpha stigmas, the overzealous Sion, and slim divide between what is good and evil. This show can deliver ‘if’ you let yourself get pulled in.

    The best way to enjoy this series is if you have watched all four, if not why the fuck are you reading the reviews you've got some amazing shows to watch. But if you have great, this show is basically what if people that went to another world, went to another world. To be honest I think its nice, like from the 4 anime's they chose konosuba is the only ""positive"" one whereas the others are darker. So this gives us a nice pull away from those seasons. Also some of those series are still awaiting their second season such as Saga of Tanya and Re:zero, which I enjoyed. So this gives me reassurance that there will be another season lol. 
 
I think the main reason why this is so enjoyable is to see the characters interact with each other, which we wouldn't be able to see. And when they bring up references from their animes that gives it all the more joy. 
 
Basically, if you have suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety or anything else that causes you emotional suffering and you have seen Saga of Tanya the Evil, Overlord 1, 2 and 3, Konosuba season 1 and 2 ANNNNDDDD Re:zero, then this is the cure to all your problems. Thank me later.

    I made a review of this earlier, but decided to update it after seeing the anime and seeing how it finished. 
 
So... I'm not sure if you read my older review on here, but I basically stated that ""I was disappointed with how the anime went because although it had great pacing, great animation, great music etc. It would not be able to fully flesh out and develop the story in only 13 episodes because it ends at a bad time (if you read the manga you know what I'm talking about). Although it will be good, it won't be as good as it could have been.""  
 
I still agree with everything I said, the only difference now though is that now that I know this anime series is planning on having at least a 2nd season, it will be absolutely superb.  
 
For those who have not read the manga, the amount that the anime shows you only goes up to a very small part of the show. Nothing has actually happened YET. This was more like the introduction, but now that I know a 2nd season is coming?? OH HO HOOOOOO HERE WE GO!!!! 
 
A lot more will be presented in the 2nd season, and you will see all the KICK ASS action (hopefully if it's going to show the parts that I am thinking of) and all that amazing character development that is shown in the manga.  
 
So boku no hero academia season 1 was great, for an intro. to the series. If it was it's own stand alone work I'd give it like a 7 at most. But now that I know it's simply an introduction to the series, Ima give it an 8. 
 
The reason for this is because it ended amazingly, and ended perfectly for an intro to take place, it gave you enough to learn about this environment that you're put in and gave you enough juices to like/love it. It also ended on a solid point, and gave you a fulfilling end when you finished it, it also left you with a little cliff hanger towards the very end keeping you anticipating for more coming from the series.  
 
God I love this series. They did everything so superbly.  
 
P.S. One thing I would like to mention that I had stated in my older review. 
 
I noticed that the color scheme at the beginning was very childish. Like they made everything really bright and vibrant which I felt didn't suit the series, well for the introduction of the series it did but later on the show takes a serious and ""dark"" turn which is why I though ""Oh God I hope this is on purpose and that they will give the appropriate color scheme and atmosphere when shit gets real."" And they did, for every situation, and just God I love this anime adaptation. And the music fit, the characters were awesome, God I love this show.

    This is an everyday high school life kind of anime.The two main characters Taiga and Ryuuji.Both of them help each other to win the hearts of the person they admire..The girl ryuuji admires is minori who is the best friend of taiga and the guy Taiga likes is Ryuji's best friend.I've only watched 11 episodes so i cant explain much but basically its just a typical high school life with some problems here and there 
 
Art: Its art is pretty unique.I find Taiga unique as i dun see characters drawn like her very often.Same goes for ryuuji..The thing i like about this art is that its not some typical common looking anime character :D 
 
Sound: sound is reasonable i guess no flaws and such 
 
Character: Ryuuji is actually and good and non violent guy dispite his looks and the misunderstandings ppl gives him because of his appearance. Taiga on the other hand is cute and small sized but dispite her appearance shes very violent and alot of ppl are afraid of her..including teachers..there are a few other characters which will be introduced and im sure you'll come to find them interesting as i do too 
 
Enjoyment: so far i think i enjoyed it well . Good comedic scenes which will be sure to tickle ur funny bone(omg that line was so corny haha) 
 
Overall i guess this anime is worth a 9 :3 
 
hope my review helps ya! enjoy watching Toradora :3

    Three years ago, I watched S1 on a whim. I loved it. It and Your Lie in April were the two 2014 shows I gave 9/10. In the end I narrowly chose YuYuYu S1 as my 2014 anime of the year, despite the controversial final episode. I was okay with S1's ending because YuYuYu wanted to forge a hopeful path rather than one of desolation. 
 
The prequel, Washio Sumi, aired earlier in Japanese theatres. Though it never approached S1's greatness, it still mixed the slice-of-life and magical girl elements well. Though it was a straightforward show with a telegraphed ending, I gave it a solid 6/10. The first ""half"" of YuYuYu S2 is the Washio Sumi movie, but repackaged into episodes. The real S2 is this, the Hero arc. 
 
The reason why Washio Sumi went to theatres and not YuYuYu S2, unlike what Madoka Magica did with Rebellion, is simple. YuYuYu S2 is inferior and is completely void of the magic that made S1 so good. 
 
S1 explored each of the characters and still had time for plenty of magical girl action. There were episodes that focused on each club member, allowing the viewer to care for them. So what happened in S2? It decided to not be a magical girl show. In the first five episodes, there is only about 1 minute total of magical girl action. The ""new"" girl, Sonoko, added absolutely nothing to S2 and was only there just to sell more drama CDs based on the star power of Kana Hanazawa. Itsuki and Fuu became background characters. Karin had one moment alone with Yuuna but that was it. 
 
By episode 5, there is a complete reversal which makes the previous episodes irrelevant, as the show throws away the main plot point. In the final episode, we're given a deus ex machina ending that makes you wonder why this hadn't already happened. How come none of the other girls up to this point had the courage to do this? What makes Yuuna so special? I felt absolutely no emotion as Yuuna delivered her final hero punch. 
 
Some people said that you get more out of S2 by taking in the surrounding media in the franchise, such as the light novel, visual novel, and manga. However, I believe that an anime should be able to stand on its own. While YuYuYu S2 wasn't the worst 2017 anime I've seen, it is by far the most disappointing. I don't know of any other show that completely threw its second season like this. What a damn shame, because I had it pegged as an anime of the year contender. I can only imagine what this could've been had it been 12 episodes like S1.

    Oh gawd Ano Hana... Ano Hana is one of those Anime that make you sad. So damn sad that after you are done watching it you look at your blank screen, try to process what just happened, jump into your bed, just to think about everything that occured in the course of the last night because you could not go to sleep, as the story was just so damn ...gripping.  
That's right, I watched Ano Hana in one go without actually planing it. People told me stuff like ""get ready for the feels"" or ""tears will be shed"" so I was prepared... Well so i thought. I won't have to go over the story so here my rating + thoughts: 
 
Story:  
Not going to summaries as it is against the guidelines.  
 
Art: 
Was really,really well fitting. I loved it and it was just wonderful to watch.  
 
Sound: 
I am listening to the OST ""Last train home"" right now as I like to listen to them while I am writing reviews. Every musical piece in Ano Hana was just perfect. Ending and Opening and all the OSTs that were made to fit for each character.  
 
Character: 
They were all individuals. What I mean by it is, that they seemed as if they were real, as if they would have really lived through all these struggles with their friend gone. That's something that not all Anime Characters do. You don't often find such real individuals that you can believe. This realness is something that Ano Hana is able to make the Viewers feel. And that's why it is so outstanding. You get emotionaly attached because you can belive in all these single events that take place because they seem so real.  
 
Enjoyment:  
Ano Hana was beautiful. The story, the characters, how they developed. I was completely gone after the Ending. That was something completely new to me. My emotions were playing roller-coaster that time and I did not know how to handle it. And all this was part of the enjoyment. It made me realize how I ""connected"" to this story. I certainly did enjoy it.  
 
Overall:  
As I said, it was an emotional roller-coaster. In a mere five hours I went from happieness to abysmal sadness up and down. It gripped me and did not let go until the very end.

    WAIT!! before you think ""oh an overrated magical girl show"". because thats what i thought , until i actually watched it, I am going to keep this brief, but I am a fan of Shaft's work, so automatically i should've watched this, but as soon as i found out it was a magical girl genre, i turned it away, which im sure many other people have done as well. Now i realize that was the biggest mistake ive made since watching hellsing in dub, madoka magica is amazing, through and through, the story is solid and gets very heavy, its not a kids show for sure, i will recommend this to anyone who is either a fan of shaft or psychological mind fuckery.

Plot 
 
The progression of the story runs very smoothly and the characters develop beautifully. Everything falls into a nice chronological order, but still retains a certain element of unpredictability. Unpredictability and unique characters are important elements that every anime needs, but sports anime especially. Kuroko no Basket has a great balance of both. In this particular work you've got Kagami and Kuroko, who are practically foils. Kagami is first introduced into the story as boisterous and has an overwhelming presence, while Kuroko is quiet and lacks a presence all together. Unfortunately, not every character gets that same development, such as Mitobe and Koganei, but maybe we'll see more in season 3 this January. When you look at the story progression as a whole it’s actually very simplistic. Two basketball players become stronger to make their high school basketball team the best in the region. I love that simplicity. Not all anime need to have a hugely in depth story that has tons of lore and background. The background information in this story is simple enough to be accomplished through short flashbacks and that’s a good thing. Simplicity is sometimes overlooked and it’s nice having a basic, yet entertaining story from time to time.   
 
 
Art and Animation 
 
At a first glance you might see the animation as stiff; however as the show progresses their movements become a lot smoother. That transition from stiff to smooth might have been unintentional, but it also could have been intentionally done to show improvement in skill. As for the art, it took me a while to warm up to it. The way the faces of the characters are drawn seemed to be slightly disproportionate, but it grows on you after a while. I look back at the anime now and hardly recognize it. 
 
 
Final Thoughts 
 
Overall, this is a fantastic anime and I'm highly anticipating the release of season 3 this winter. One of things that makes, or breaks, an anime for me is character development. I can lose interest in a work if the characters aren’t strong enough. Kuroko no Basket has well developed characters and relationships between these characters. If you’re looking for an anime that makes your heart race when you know something cool is about to happen, or when the episode ends and you immediately click to the next one, this one is it. I understand this personally, because I absolutely burnt through this series. I’ve only recently gotten into sports anime and out of the handful I’ve seen thus far this is easily in my top three.

    Vampire Hunter D is hired by a girl who wants vengeance for being bitten by a vampire, then he goes and kills the vampire. 
 
I honestly thought that the plot of this particular film was just a little bit shallow and maybe too straightforward to be very interesting. I know with that riveting synopsis many would think otherwise, but this is just my subjective opinion on the matter so there’s no need to get uptight about anything. Jokes aside, there are genuine attempts for the script to dive into specific topics, like D’s desire to be human, but they’re scrapped seconds after their introduction. Since any chance of depth is abandoned, we’re left with a complete bore for a lead and a supporting cast that gets stuck with awkward, sporadic developments that backfire as comedic.  
 
Most of the animation is too jerky and sloppy to earn merit, which means the only fallback is on some of the cool designs for the fantasy monsters. Granted of course that this thing was made in 1985, but when your competition is something like Nausicaä then leniency on old animation starts to fade. The movie indulges in a bit of pointless fanservice and never fails to display a pair of nips in areas where the viewer is in danger of falling asleep. Whoever happens to be viewing this is, of course, welcome to snooze anytime without worry, and a couple nude shots in desperation is all the more pathetic. The dub is also atrocious so don’t bother with it if you do decide to be that viewer. 
 
Overall, Vampire Hunter D is boring. Most bad films come with the joy of being perplexing to behold, but this one couldn’t offer more than a chuckle as to how badly the script treated its side characters. It is superficiality made cartoon, so unless you really dig awkwardly animated vampires and ghouls beating each other up, there is no need to sneak a peek. 
 
Vampire Hunter D (1985): 
3/10

    Story 7 - The story has holes, some arcs felt rushed at times and left some important questions unanswered. I feel like it could have been smoothed out better with an extra episode worth of content spread out where it needed it, but instead we got a surprisingly satisfying filler mid-way through the series. The main message of the anime is somewhat singular and explores the layers of what that message means. 5/10(70% of story) 
 
I can't not bring up the action as playing a major role in the way the story unfolds, where some would brush it off into the Art category. 10/10(30% of story) 
 
My attempt to explain why this anime's story style felt different to me: 
This anime is (overall) like a large puzzle that fills itself in as it grows bigger and sacrifices bits and pieces as it grows outward. This allows a lot more content to be discovered about earlier episodes regardless of arc, and i think this is what throws people off about this anime. 
 
Where as most other anime have a small series-wide puzzle and each episode or arc fills in a separate puzzle, as to not leave any pieces out.  
If that makes sense lol. 
 
Art 10 - This is undeniably where the anime shines the brightest through the action scenes. Fluid, amazingly detailed, colorful. So many wonderful frames. This is where a good amount of the story takes place and for good reason. 
 
Sound 8 - Nothing special here, satisfying without standing out. Voice acting was well done at conveying emotions. 
 
Characters 7 - Mirai, I found her to be something different then the average kawaii. She is absolutely charming and makes you smile with her quirks and it grows on you. This is something i haven't felt often in other animes or as strongly and i absolutely want more, a very simple character that adds depth through minor actions. 
 
The rest of the cast comes off as relatively basic. The brother with a sister complex doesn't come off as sexual attraction anymore than just seeking affection from her. 
 
The evil intentioned characters needed far more explanation + depth. 
 
Enjoyment 9 - You get a whole lot of insanely satisfying action and a bit of everything else. comedy, feels, darkness, hope, hopelessness. It rolls up into a trip that might not take the road you wanted, but makes its way. 
 
Overall 8 - This anime isn't anything new, but it felt fresh in its own way. It's like a restaurant brings you a slightly different dish then what you ordered, so you either return it in anger, or try it, and realize you wanted this instead of your original order. 
 
Personal Overall Rating - 10/10 I want to see new anime show a unique side like this did for me through superb action and a hard to describe different approach,  and correct what needed to be done better.

    Alright, a warning: this review will involve minor spoilers, if you want to go in fresh, then I would stop reading this now, but I would argue that this spoiler will help you have a better idea of what you're getting into and will probably help you enjoy it if you choose to watch. 
 
TL;DR Shuumatsu is an anime that tries to do a few things at once and doesn't quite succeed at any of it. While none of the elements are critical failures at an objective level, they contradict each other and create problems. If you are looking for a fluffy show with bright colours and a happy story then you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a more action oriented fantasy about struggle then you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a full tragedy then you will be disappointed. I think the best chance one has of enjoying this is to only be in the moment with this show. Ignore the artwork, ignore what other people say what it's about, ignore your expectations and just accept it moment by moment. If you can accomplish that, then you can enjoy this. I think that's how other people did. 
 
I didn't. 
 
From here on are spoilers. Proceed at your own risk. 
 
 
We get our set up: Willem, the male protagonist, is a lone survivor of the human race in a distant post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. While humans are long extinct and the surface of the world inhabited by apocalyptic doom monsters, the world is still inhabited by beast-races and fantasy races that live on flying islands above the surface. Unfortunately, doom monsters still rise from the surface to attack the islands. To defend themselves, the beast races must use the legendary swords left behind by the Brave Heroes of the human race and the ONLY ones who can wield these swords are young girls called leprechauns which are kept by the military as living weapons.  
 
 
Oh, and the girls finish off the monsters by blowing themselves up using the swords. 
 
Yeah. 
 
 Willem then becomes these girls' caretaker and what follows is a sombre story filled with pops of daily life and harsh battles as we get to know the girls and one by one come to lose them... 
 
...is what you'd think. Instead what we get is a slice of life story. Willem takes care of the younger girls, supports the older girls, cleans, bakes and gets flirted with by the oldest leprechaun and female lead, Ctholly. He also tunes the swords properly. As it turns out he is actually one of the Brave Heroes that used the legendary swords in the past and thus knows how to use them without destroying the wielder. He teaches the girls how to use them as well as fight and the story turns into one of triumph over the odds, peppered with slice of life moments... 
 
...is what you'd think. Instead, we get both of those. Sort of. The result is both bizarre and largely unsatisfying. We get long scenes and stretches of multiple episodes with characters baking and cleaning happily, punctuated by battles that take place either entirely offscreen or only appear for 30 seconds at a time. However, the build up to these battles paints them as though they were major conflicts that would define the series, creating disappointment when one actually gets to them and they are both short and have no lasting impact. The series drips in tragic foreshadowing and time and again it seems as if we're going to to lose one of the characters either to battle, accident, side effect of military maintenance, or degradation of the mind. Yet each time, everyone comes out fine. Not just fine, but perfectly healthy and happy. This happens repeatedly throughout the show: They'll foreshadow a loss or tragedy and constantly have the characters be completely uninhibited. After a time, all the tension loses its charm. Yet, at the same time it keeps the dread in the background so enjoying the slice of life scenes to their fullest becomes tainted.  
 
In short, it's a show that keeps promising that if you just watch a liiiiiittle more, something big is going to happen, and then it almost never does. This is compounded by the fact that when serious situations occur, people don't treat them as they should. Willem has a complex about saving people. At the same time, another character is - without going into too many details - struck ill. There is a ticking clock counting down on the character until the illness progresses so much that the character is destroyed. There is one item that Willem thinks of that can halt this process. He figures out where it is but instead of he and the character attempting to get it as soon as possible, they encounter a roadblock...and then they all proceed to wait patiently for the roadblock to pass and have a cute Christmas celebration.  
 
That's it.  
 
No one attempts to think of another solution. No one really chomps at the bit. Nothing. It gives the audience a mixed message: Is this a big deal or not? It becomes hard to tell, which means it becomes hard to engage with the major events of the plot. This happens repeatedly and then compounds until, by the time episode 12 rolls around and things DO become tragic, any investment in the show has a good chance of being long since evaporated.  
 
Finally, in terms of pacing, the entire thing feels chaotic, with cute scenes of baking, cleaning or ecchi massages coming during tense build ups to life and death situations. As I said, the effect is bizarre.  
 
 
Of course, your mileage will vary. 
 
Story gets a 3/10. The elements are THERE to make it good but they are put together so chaotically that all of the shows themes and powerful elements end up muted and confused. Sometimes even agitating. 
 
Art gets a 7/10. It was pretty, but not in any fashion that set it apart from most modern bright shows. 
 
Sound gets a 7/10. The music often fades into the background but can sometimes enhance a scene very well. The use of Scarborough Fair is excellent both times it is used and the OP is not my cup of tea for the most part. Oddly enough, the OP is a good summary of the show: For the most part it is this J-Poppy song but for a brief period it just ROCKS OUT which is kinda like how the show has a tiny bursts of action floating in this endless soup of other stuff. 
 
Characters gets a 6/10. Over the course of the show I felt that they had the bones of good characters but I only felt I got to know them in the latter parts of episode 12, and by then it was far too late. I feel that if more time had been spent on diving into the characters, their pasts and their actions rather than the slice of life stuff earlier, then the characters would have been better realized. Unfortunately, this was not the case. 
 
Enjoyment gets a 1/10. This show made me very salty (yeah, I know) and I was agitated for most of the time I watched it passed a certain point. Essentially nothing happened for the longest period of time. That was the problem. It kept hinting that something would happen, only for the story to continue plodding along with no urgency or changes.  
 
Overall 4/10. It had good moments and good ideas, but put together in such a fashion that only served to weaken them. 
 
And there's Shuumatsu. It had the makings of a great tragedy. It had the makings of an post-apocalyptic action fantasy. It had the makings of a sweet romance and it had the makings of a cute slice of life. However, by doing all of these elements at once and put together so chaotically? I found it weakened them all. 
 
That being said, if you stick to it and ignore ANY expectations you have and just enjoy it by a scene by scene basis until you get to the end? You might have a good time. 
 
 I didn't, but I hope you do.

    When you think of sad anime, what comes to mind? Uh, lets see, uuuhhh, clannad, clannad after story, clannad before story, clannad after after story, uuhh, yeah I guess. Oh yeah, and anohana. Well, yeah I guess... 
 
A sad and emotional anime, yet a short one at that, anohana is about a boy named jintan who has become a shut in gamer ever since the death of one of his friends, and the separation of his other friends. But one day, he starts seeing the goa- ghost of his lost friend, menma. Now, in order to send her up to heaven, he and his friends get back together to make her wish come true. Yeap. The story is actually pretty emotional. But......im gonna admit......I never rlly cried, or even felt like crying. Maybe its because the ending was a bit rushed. Like, if there was at least one more episode, it could've ended off better, and given certain characters more screen time. 
 
The animation is overall good, not great, but still good. The character design is the biggest strength art wise. However, one issue I have (I'm not taking points off for this) is that on crunchyroll, its highest is 480p, instead of at least 720. I mean, hd existed in 2011. So why isn't a show from 2011 in hd? no clue... 
 
The soundtrack is very well done imo. The OP and ED are both gr8. The voice acting is gr8. That's all I gotta say tbh. yeah. 
 
Characters rlly feel alive, and that's where anohana shines. Instead of focusing on art and animation (like many shows nowadays), it focuses on its characters, and makes them very good. The issue, tho, is that some characters get a ton of screen time (jinta, naruko) while others lack in screen time (especially popo). If they had at least another episode, they could have gotten more screen time. Also, while the characters do confess how they feel towards eachother, the only one who rlly gets any development is jinta and naruko. Besides that, most characters don't change much.  
 
I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. It did occasionally get boring, but that may be because of how short it was. Despite that, it rlly was tense, and the ending, while predictable, was satisfying. Again, not much to say. 
 
Here is teh verdict: 
 
Story: 9 
Characters: 9 
Art: 8 
Animation: 7 
Sound: 9 
Voice Acting: 9 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
Overall Score: 8.57 
My Score: 8.6 
 
On the positive side: 
 
The story was fresh 
The characters were good 
The art and animation were pretty good 
The soundtrack sounded nice 
The character designs felt alive 
You can finish this show very quickly 
 
On the negative side: 
 
The short length (11 eps) left unanswered questions, some characters undeveloped, and a rushed storyline 
The series was occasionally predictable (I could already predict the ending just by reading the sypnosis) 
The quality wasn't very good (480p for a show made in 2011) 
 
Biggest Strength: The characters 
Biggest Weakness: The short length

    This season is a joke compared to the last two, hopefully the next season is better. No good fight scenes, bad characterization, wasted plotlines. Hibiki gets turned into a crybaby for no real reason. The villains are uninteresting this time around and for the first time in Symphogear, the final battle is crap. It has none of the tension the original or G had. Every plot twist is a massive asspull and comes out of nowhere. While thats normal for a show as campy as this one, GX takes it way too far. The subplot with Hibiki's father is overly forced and loses any of its emotional appeal.  They try to focus on too many characters at once so you feel jerked around all over the place. This season also has a vastly different tone than the last and also uses the dreaded monster of the week format. I almost recommend skipping this season or reading a synopsis if Symphogear AXZ turns out to be good. 
 
The biggest problem is how halfassed every fight scene in this season is compared to the first two seasons. Its a complete letdown, considering how awesome the fight choreography was in the original Symphogear and G. Compare the Maria VS Tsubasa fights in G or anyone vs Fin'e in the original. In GX every fight is over in one or two moves.  As someone who likes the first two seasons this is such a massive falloff that I'm reluctant to watch AXZ when it airs.

    I will preface by stating I have never seen The Tatami Galaxy. This is also only the second work I have seen by Yuasa, Masaaki. I only watched it in the first place because a friend of mine suggested it. This movie has its place, this movie can even be called good. Though to me, a layman, casual anime watcher, this movie was not worth my time.  
 
The art style is insanely unique and something worth commending but it isn't something I would want every anime to look like. At the very beginning I actually found it annoying and because of it, was hard to connect with the characters. So the first 30 minutes of the movie I was like, this art style is unique but at points hard to look at. I wouldn't say it is without detail because it has details, it was simply done and easy to understand. Something I liked as I watched more. Though I prefer more details on characters, the set pieces were great but when I felt a disconnect from the characters it hurt my enjoyment from the story. 
 
The sound to this whole movie is up there at the top, it was my favorite part of the whole movie. It helped tell the story and actually had a place when the characters were singing, the songs weren't filler but actually there own plot telling tools, something that has been lost in musicals of today.  
 
That is really I can praise the movie for though, an art style that I didn't prefer over a normal style along with music and sounds that are above and beyond the standards we see today. 
 
The characters are normal but each have their own quirks that are interesting. If I had to choose my favorite it would be Gakuensai Jimukyokuchou, Depraved Director, he was interesting, unique and to me told a story more compelling in the short time he was in scenes than the main story of this movie. The side characters of this story, were much more interesting than the main pair.  
 
Which is something I look for in anime, I want the main character I can connect with and I didn't get that with the main two. The character I connected with most was Rihaku, and it bugged me how they wrote his plight because I would have written the opposite. The theme of isolation wasn't the main theme but it was the plight of two characters. Rihaku told himself to embrace the isolation while Kurokami told herself to interact with more people.  
 
Rihaku was plighted with time spinning fast all around him ""Time in isolation flies like an arrow..."" I completely disagree. Time slows when we take notice of it, something the movies tells us the opposite of. ""A watched pot never boils."" ""A watched clock never moves."" ""You watching paint dry?"" When we bring ourselves to take notice of time or become impatient for something to happen it all slows.  
 
From my own experience, I would argue when the man was laying in his death bed, time wouldn't be flying by, time would be standing still.  
 
I would have written his character the same but drawn him as a young or middle-aged man. I would then when Kurokami comforts him have him rapid age as the clocks around his room begin rapidly spinning his life draining from his eyes and his lips curved in a smile. Just my own opinion but something I would have enjoyed more. 
 
Then the main two, a standard as I saw nothing remarkable in either of them. I won't explain either of them here as the plot does it fine. Though in simple terms we have Kurokami living her life in the moment, and Senpai... is a timid man hopelessly in love. 
 
The plot of the story heavily revolves around the theme of time. I don't feel the execution was stellar and it even dragged out points that weren't important along with a 25min more open that could have easily been 10.  
 
Then in closing my final verdict on this movie is a 4, I put it as a 2 on my page but that is because I'm not a fan of these to start with.  
 
The movie has its place and even probably thrives there, it's not for everyone though. The dialogue is fast pace, confusing, and overly complex. The characters aren't flawless and neither is the execution.  
 
The sound and artwork are worth knowing about, it doesn't save the movie though. 
 
To the casual watcher don't, to a fan of his works I suggest it.

    The definition of Code Geass relies solely on the morals and idealistic ideology of people in different views, the show focuses on these conceptions and relies solely on explaining how it is the perfect solution to this complex problem. In some parts the show paces itself unrealistically which makes you question it's approach, in most parts it is defined pretty well, since this show in the first place is not real, the plot relies on the power which of that Geass to change the fate of humanity, which therefore leads to unknown territory. During this phase, trying to understand the show for what it is may be the best approach. It is best to keep an open mind and think for yourself it's definitive message.  
 
Whilst for some people this is extraordinarily painful to watch, like-said it is best to keep an open mind when watching this show, personally, I like the way how it goes, for the most part. Leading to a somewhat acceptable conclusion but can  and could have been done differently, but in the end decided to go for a ending that showed what an ideology could do, and what could happen if you sticked through with it, learning these things, for me, was a pretty good watch.

    Boy am I disappointed.  ( Short, spoiler free, honest review )  
 
First off let me begin by saying; I cannot fathom how an anime of such high expectations could have possibly fallen so low below the margin of a worthwhile anime.  
 
With a rather explosive start, Akame_ga_Kill reveals it's main casts of characters, it's dark plot, and it's appealing art style. I had high hopes for this anime. Sadly, as weeks passed, and more episodes were released, the lower my expectations became, and by the end the only thing received was utter disappointment.   
 
All in all  Akame_ga_Kill is an anime that falls short of anything noteworthy. With characters of very little development throughout the anime, an overall rushed story, unsatisfying ending, and ""plot twists""  that were so predictable I nearly cringed, Akame_ga_Kill is a bad anime that I wouldnt recommend to anyone.

    Ohh, what to say... there was a point where I really did love Azumanga Daioh the anime, even though I liked the manga more. But now, I just can't like it as much, when I like the manga that much more. I mean, I would rather read the manga than watch the anime. I'm in the minority here, but that's okay, I realize most people think the anime is amazing. 
 
Story 
 
The story is something either people really like, or really dislike. Some people believe it's genius, while other believe it's annoying and boring. Personally slice-of-life is my favorite of genres, so it suits me well to watch or read Azumanga Daioh. The humor is abundant and always allows for laughs. 
 
The story doesn't have a complex plot; basically it follows the simple day-to-day life of 6 high school girls. But the way it's presented makes the difference, and it's not a boring read or watch at all. 
 
Animation 
 
One of the reasons I like the manga more is the poorly done animation. There's often deliberate pauses, and the characters don't move much. I'm aware that most anime does not have amazing animation, but Azumanga Daioh has worst than most, in my opinion. 
 
Music/Soundtrack 
 
I think this is my favorite aspect: the soundtrack music. In fact, I bought the first soundtrack CD. Some are peppy and enthusicastic, while others are sweet and nostalgic. The opening and ending themes are also well-suited for the show. 
 
Character 
 
No matter in the anime or the manga, I just love the characters of Azumanga Daioh (my personal favorite being Kagura). There is Chiyo-chan, the ever adorable child progidy, the quiet mysterious cute-loving Sakaki, the annoying and rowdy Tomo, the slow-minded and incredibly unique Osaka, atheltic and rambunctious Kagura, and finally, the weight-conscious sensible Yomi. Each character has their own quirks and are well-rounded. I like their relationships with one another, too, and how their friendship progresses throughout the series. 
 
Voices 
 
The voices are a downfall, at least with the dubbed version. I just can't stand Chiyo-chan's squeaky and unnaturally high-pitched voice. Actually, I can't stand Chiyo-chan's voice in either the Japanese or the English. However, the voices of the others are all well done.  
 
Overall, I give Azumanga Daioh, the anime, a 7. I give Azumanga Daioh the manga a 10. Even so, I reccomend this anime, but while reccomending that one should read the manga beforehand.

    Okay, let me keep this simple. I was pretty intrigued to watch Golden Time due to how good Toradora was and that this was by the same creator as Toradora. Well, let me just say one thing, don't get your hopes too high for this anime since it is gonna go crashing like a TRAIN TRAIN. Why do I say this first? Well, it's a review so I need to find a way to hook you into my not so fine review.. hehe. Seriously though, Golden Time feels off the mark as compared to Toradora. It doesn't feel as polished and well rounded as Toradora, like something is missing. I know I've only been talking good things about Toradora and literally almost said nothing related to this show, so, let me present to you, my review on Golden Time. >.< 
 
As for the story goes, I see where they were trying to go there, if you haven't watched it which you probably shouldn't yet if you are looking at reviews, let me explain. Firstly, the setting is in an university, something that I'd call unusual. I find it harder for an university setting to be able to allow the characters to bond together more. Also, the story feels forced, really feels unnatural at all. The relationships move in a really weird way, their love for each other feels like they were playing some role playing game. I don't see that much you can enjoy about this show. Perhaps, the love triangle that probably isn't supposed to be one in the first place or the Banri's past memories that's been haunting him for his 1 year ever since he has lost his memories. Other than that, it feels stale, plain and something that takes some effort to truly enjoy the show.  
 
The art was definitely a well done from me. From their facial expression and body language I was able to roughly speculate what personality does that character possess. Actually, I take that back a little. Every main character is well drawn except for one character, the main character himself, Tada Banri. To be honest, if an anime was going to have a memory loss moment, then at least make their personalities before & after similar. The human brain just doesn't change personality that easily from just a memory loss. I will assume that Banri's character design was based off his memories prior to him losing them. If that's the case, I feel that he should be more stern instead of looking somewhat neutral. This, my friends, is the result of lazy artists trying to blend in both the personalities together, but my honest opinion is that they should stay true to the original personality. 
 
Yea it sounds great, let's move on, haha, just kidding. As for voice actors go, I don't have an objection with them, as long as they don't go off character, they are always fine with me. However, I LOVE how the voice actor for Kouko sang every opening theme and ending theme this show has to offer. Won't say exactly catchy, but it's an effort that I will not leave out in any of my reviews.  
 
The characters really feel weird. You have some angry man, a weeb, a loli, a rich nogger that has no confidence and some idiot that fell off the bridge LOL. They always try to throw in some random moment to try to increase suspense and tension between the characters, cheap move JC staff, cheap move. Okay, I really have nothing to say anymore. Let me just quickly say some things that will be counted as filler so my review looks long. The weeb was my personal favourite character as I can totally relate to him like he was my soulmate alike. The loli was there clearly for the camera and the pun. The angry man was there to get physically abused by the rich nogger who clearly is the most annoying character in this whole series. 
 
I barely enjoyed this anime, perhaps I laughed a bit? Might be the memes, I forgot. I don't see a point recommending this if you have watched better romance serializations such as Toradora, Ore Monogatari, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!. However, if you are a real big fan of this romance genre, which trust me, I actually am. Do give it a shot, it might not as bad as I wrote it if you are so into the romance genre.

    Astra is an enjoyable enough show, but I can't help but feel that it squanders some of the potential set by its strong beginning.  
 
The concept of students adrift in space, braving the hazards of intergalactic travel and alien worlds is a sound idea, but it doesn't take long to realize that the show plays it a little too safe. The kids don't encounter too many dangerous situations, and they're all resolved quickly through the power of friendship and working together. I feel like things could have been a little more desperate, but alas, the real point of the show is the characters and their development. At least the entire cast is pretty likable, though the plot tends to lean a little too heavily on individual characters' secret backstories and shocking revelations that are more convoluted than shocking. 
 
Further heightening the positive and upbeat nature of the show, the character, planet and spaceship designs tend to be bright, colorful and maybe a bit simplistic at times. The animation quality is hardly the worst I've seen, but it's not terribly detailed either. Well, the bits of fan service that do pop up get a little more love and attention, but they're mostly limited to a couple of episodes and the show doesn't exactly rely on them.  
 
Overall, Astra is good but not particularly stand-out. There are far worse options out there, and I can safely recommend it, but it's not the sort of harrowing survival story the premise and first episode would lead you to believe.

    This was a nice watch. The story proved itself to be interesting, taking inspiration from the escaped research facility girl with special powers trope, while putting a unique and original spin on it by utilizing Alice in Wonderland imagery. The idea of ""Mirror Gates"", each with their own unique set of powers and whatnot, provides wonderful grounds for narrative growth, limited only by how many powers one can come up with. The story changed about a third of the way through, from more of a sci-fi escape quasi-action featuring a magical girl and nefarious government agency, to an almost slice-of-life style story with magical mishaps and how a young girl comes to exist as a normal person in a world that is utterly alien to her resulting in a mixture of funny and touching moments. That switch was unexpected, but proved only to make the show better for it. The art tried to flaunt its 3D in their exceptionally long first episode, but it fell flat on its face in my opinion, looking outdated and clunky in comparison to what their art direction should have been going on. luckily they drop the clunkier 3D very shortly thereafter, and the rest of the art is well done, no less than one should expect from a modern anime. The sound is perfectly normal, with a playful soundtrack and voice actors that fit their characters like a glove. The characters were my favorite part, and I found myself getting invested in their lives. Between Sana, with her unforgiving curiosity and penchant for mischief, Zoroku, with his stern old man discipline veiling a heart truly full of love for those in his life, and all the people that surround them in everyday life, it was a pleasure to get a glimpse of that. Even Zoroku's assistants are so realistic and human, and get their own special moments. The development of Minnie C has got to be my favorite example of a human villain off the top of my head. Her reasons for getting involved with the whole sinister government operation and engaging in so much ruthless behavior makes me almost want to forgive her. It was so heart-wrenching that I just felt like she should get her own happy ending, too. and that, ladies and gentlemen is how you write a good villain. On the total opposite end of the spectrum, however, is Cleo. Cleo, for those who don't remember his 5 minutes of dialogue, was one of the children from the research center. They set him up to be important and whatnot, they have him make a robot toy, and then he just disappears! That looks like an oversight to me. Like he once did play a big part, but they wrote a different show and put it over the part where he was going to matter. It keeps a good deal of levity throughout, but still has its serious moments so you don't forget how sinister the world can sometimes be. Overall a heartwarming show about family, accepting who you are, and learning that you shouldn't try to rely on yourself all the time.

    ""Simple is best"" isn't always an accurate statement. So instead of doing the usual score / followed by explanation, I'll give you a rundown of why I liked and disliked this show. 
 
I know I'll probably get some hate for saying this, but this show isn't as perfect as 95% (or so, or more) of the reviews would have you believe. That doesn't mean it's bad though, it's actually a very solid show. 
 
What's wrong with it then? 
In MY opinion, some of the characters (or rather, how they were used), the sound and art aren't up to par with a ""perfect"" show. I also think the Studio  made more episodes than were needed as ""fillers"", which made them sort of rush the ending to complete the story. 
 
I believe a character like Azuma could have received more time on screen during the first half of the show, with more time allocated to him, rather than simply tagging along with Kou or the rest of the squad. He's a nice and important character which wasn't explored as much as he could have been. After his ''bad guy'' act when he's first presented, he seems to turn into a Kou magnet - he goes where Kou goes and often scolds him or ""tags along"" with him, but that's that. He does receive some love later on though... 
 
Then you have Senda - though I suppose he is simply doing what he's supposed to do - being an annoying arse. If that was the intention, then they surely hit the spot. 
 
There's one ""character"" which I do despise though and I'm not sure if any other reviewer covered this. The cat. That cat honestly almost made me drop the show - He serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever and he's not even ''cute'' or anything of that sort, he's just a disturbance. 
 
This cat will show up at random times, FOR NO REASON, and simply ''meow'' it out. Ok, had it been once or twice, or thrice, I wouldn't have minded it. But more than THIRTY times? Yes, I did count it and I'm not talking about him being present in different situations either, I'm talking about this freak showing up to *MEOW* with the exact same face and annoying sound, THE EXACT SAME - they didn't even bother recording a different sound for most of the time he's on screen. That alone brought the quality of the show down quite a lot - also, it's not only during the episodes either, during the 2nd half of the show they add an Intro Quiz and the Answer to that Quiz after the ED, in which he's ALWAYS present doing that stupid annoying *MEOW*. Good Lord is that annoying, and now DOUBLY so since you'll be seeing that shit in the INTRO, episode and after-ED. Good luck with that - talk about Anger Management.... 
 
But I digress - since I mentioned that intro right above, I'll talk about the OP and the ED. As Yuuhei, Azuma would say ''Who are they?'' - I think there were 2 different OPs and 3 or 4 different EDs. I say I think because all of them were so ''so-so'' that I really can't remember them even right after watching an episode - in fact, the one thing I can remember from two of the endings is that they were really ""forced"", the vocals annoyed me a lot. I believe that I started to skip the OP and ED right at the 3rd episode, and simply stopped to check them when there was a new one. Oh, add a DOUBLE SKIP to that because there's the annoying Quiz with the cat and another annoying song sung by MOMIJI before the Quiz. Maybe it's the case that I'm just not the target audience.... yeah, maybe, but maybe not, I don't think I'd have liked this even in my early teen years. Actually, I'm sure I wouldn't have. 
 
Enough of that now, let's talk a bit about the art. What's the problem here? Not much, really. It's just that, it's just cookie cutter ""modern"" anime art, there's nothing outstanding about it, absolutely nothing. At the beginning some of the characters looked a lot like each other and I had some trouble identifying which one was which, but that quickly stopped being the case once the characters grew up. The backgrounds are not as great as I hoped them to be, even during the action scenes, which sort of let me down. There's one thing that sort of irked me though, there are times when the art looks ""flat"" - you'll get this if you pay attention to game scenes - look at the stadium, it seems like the audience and the characters look like ""bent flat papers"" - it's hard to explain but you'll see what I mean if you just look closely during the game scenes. I've also noticed this lack of ""depth"" at other times. Having seeing great art in other Anime, even anime from as far back as 1994, I was disappointed by this. 
 
The one thing that does deserve a lot of praise is how Cross Game manages to captivate you despite all of its flaws, it has a gripping power hard to find  - you want to know if X will confess to Y, or if they actually hate each other, and how Z will develop throughout the show. There was a ""twist"" mid-season which was mildly entertaining - I won't spoil it though. I also like how Cross Game deals with the loss of a loved one and relationships within the family and friends, growing up etc. Teenagers will get the most out of it, but even adults will probably take the time to remember their own hardships and moments of sadness/happiness when watching it. 
 
Have you noticed that I still have not mentioned Baseball? That's because Cross Game is able to present something other than ""just"" Baseball, which I appreciate. This doesn't mean that Baseball is left aside, so if you're a ban of Baseball, you'll not be disappointed. 
 
If, like me, you had no knowledge of Baseball beforehand, you don't have to worry - even though they could've explained a little bit more in detail how things like conceding a walk / safety bunts work, you'll get the gist of it soon enough just by watching the show. Actually, I do have to say what an amazing job they did here, because not only did I not know anything about Baseball, I had this idea that it was a very boring sport and that worried me before watching Cross Game, but I was fairly surprised to discover what Baseball is like - I actually may end up watching real Baseball now, because I quite enjoyed what I saw from the games in Cross Game. I think this concludes what I set out to achieve here - explain why the show is worth a go if you were unsure about watching it, while at the same time keeping in mind that it is definitely not perfect and you will notice its flaws if you're paying attention. 
 
I hope you enjoyed reading this review as much as I enjoyed writing it, I'm always trying to improve and will gladly read any criticism you may have towards the things I wrote - send me a PM if you feel like it!

    SPOILER-FREE™ 
 
Preface: I became extremely inebriated the night I decided to write my review of the Darker than Black franchise. While I admit this isn't my best writing ever (actually it's some of my worst), Darker than Black was one of the worse anime I've seen so it seems fitting. Yes it's going to be one of those reviews.  This is intended to cover the entire franchise, meaning this review applies to every anime with ""Darker than Black"" in the title. 
 
So let me tell you a story about the other day. Actually it was longer than that ago I think, whatever it’s a story. So I’m hanging out with this girl, just me and her. It wasn't a date or anything, our relationship was completely platonic at the time. Nowadays I would describe our relationship more as “nonexistent” than “platonic” but that’s an unrelated point, probably. 
 
Anyways she’s an artist or some shit, in the art club at college at least, one of those go-getter types good at everything you know? She gets to talking about some art exhibition that just opened that she wants to go to, maybe she should go with a friend or something (nudge nudge wink wink). Just like I always do, I fumbled that shit like Eustace, that fat kid from your gym class in school, fumbled the football thrown at his nuts by Cliff, the 7th grader who’s identical to Tim Tebow in every way except his religious fervor is more likely directed toward the King of the Bottomless Pit than Jeebus. You probably laughed your ass you little shit, you’re going to hell, where Cliff will be a ruler and violate your every orifice with a spiked dildo (no homo man, no homo). 
 
Where was I? Oh yeah, I hardly could have handled the situation worse, it was one of those situations where I might as well have been juggling gas jugs and torches but couldn't think of anything but that itch on my ass. I basically acted exactly like the densest harem protagonist imaginable with a lot less charisma and a lot more anxiety issues. My verbatim response is kept in one of those memory centers that the booze hits first but suffice to say: it was something along the lines of: 
 
“y-y-you too *mumble*” 
 
This highlights a dire point in my personal life in that I can’t handle women for shit. I mean damn, I’m more than halfway through college and I just got over panic attacks when I form words directed in an angle more acute than 70° from a vagina, or was it obtuse? I’m a goddamn business student I can’t do math. Or girls come to think of it. 
 
What does all this have to do with Darker than Black, an anime made by the great (snicker) studio Bones in the Year of our Bush 0006? Well just thinking about this story makes me embarrassed, angry and depressed, exactly the same emotions I have when I recall watching Darker than Black. 
 
STORY 2/10 
 
Did you know that in some parts of South America it’s totally normal for men to have sex with donkeys? I’m not making this up, there's a documentary on YouTube. 
 
I’d love to draw an analogy between these people and fans of this show, but no matter how I wrack my brain I simply can’t come up with any relation between being a zoophile and being a liar. The reason I say fans of DtB (Darker than Black) are liars is not because of the erroneous statement that this anime is the greatest thing since Death Note, although that argument could be made. The far more erroneous statement they will make is that the first and second seasons of BtDF (Black to the Darker Future) are COMPLETELY different and although the first season was AWESOME you can’t POSSIBLY rate the second season the same. Well I’m here to tell you they’re definitely shoving it in a mule’s pu-I mean they’re wrong. 
 
Anyway here’s the plot in a nutshell: There’s this guy named Pedro and he has sex with a donkey. I mean a mysterious event happens on earth where two “gates” (which are never properly explained or shown on screen, like a lot of this anime’s lore but ONE OF THEM WAS IN SOUTH AMERICA) open and lots of people lose their emotions, gain superpowers and their progress can be tracked by fake stars which have replaced the real night sky. You would think that NASA and such would notice if giant balls of plasma were switched with holes poked in a giant black tarp but then again you miss a lot of stuff when you’re having sex with a donkey. 
 
Scratch that. I’m not about to totally begrudge a series with some inconsistent backstory, what really matters is the characters, plot, donkey loving, etc. The “donkey loving” was just a metaphor by the way. Both seasons are the same: largely unrelated “action” and “drama” lead up to an incomprehensible ending. I don’t know what the author was going for: Evangelion-esque, a post-modern approach to consistency or maybe just screwing a donkey. By which I mean I feel like it was just supposed to leave a lot to the imagination. 
 
The goal here is to create a thriller balanced between the necessarily-authoritarian state and rebels just trying to find a place in this world. More often though it just winds up being one of Hei’s knives trying to find a place in the chest of one of many of a cast of almost interesting side characters. 
 
A lot is presented in the story, but very little is solved. The plot of this anime was tangled, barely linear, and left a lot of loose ends. Lots of sub-plots are raised, and then dropped, none of the lore is explored to any comprehensible depth, and in the end very little if anything is resolved. For example: what exactly caused this situation? How did this world change the way it did? What made the characters the emotionless blobs they are, other than a plot device? More specifically I think Hei’s powers relate to his time in South America. Maybe if you have sex with a donkey you could shoot lightning out your fingers, try it. 
 
ANIMATION 4/10 
 
Desperation can drive a man to great lengths, I should know. But never mind that, religion can drive a man to lengths reasonable men could only dream of. I’m not trying to be a militant atheist or anything, far be it from me to criticize all religion. But anime reviews are meant to inform, so I feel I should make you a little smarter. I’m sure you already know about Mormons and Scientologists so I’m going to focus on Orthodox Jews, bear with me I’m going somewhere with this. 
 
Anyway ultra-Orthodox Jews do some crazy stuff: like the hats and the meat and not pressing buttons on Saturday. But did you know that some will wear plastic bags on airplanes? 
 
Apparently the rationale is that they can’t pass over a graveyard so the plastic bag is to keep them pure just in case. I wonder what the altitude limit on that is, the era of space travel is going to be hilarious if religion survives that long. What’s more, some sects will practice circumcision in a prehistoric way. They will cut off the foreskin without anesthesia and then (supposedly to prevent infection) suck, and not even I’m creative enough to make this up, ON THE BABY’S PENIS, THERE ARE OLD MEN OUT THERE GIVING HUMMERS TO 7-DAY-OLDS. That is absolutely disgusting, just like the animation of Darker than my Soul, I mean Darker than Black. 
 
This anime is (now) 7 years old so I don’t mean to criticize by the same standards that I might apply today, but seriously it would be sub-par even 7 years before that. The production values of this show are low, to say the least. It is seriously unimpressive and to be honest I think even the poorest studios should at least include a few moments where they try to impress us. But hashed CG, still frames and lazy design are just the tip of the iceberg of an anime more than 40 episodes with not even one decent scene. Even in action, where most studios dump their money, there was really nothing to see here. Bones may not be on the same level as a Shaft or Gainax but they must have really hit a tough patch in 2007 and 2009 respectively. 
 
SOUND 6/10 
 
Maybe my problem is that I’m a weeaboo. I mean I’m drinking sake in Japan, writing an anime review. Maybe if I gave up my childish habits I could get a girlfriend, and get in shape, and make lots of money, and get back on topic. 
 
I have to offer Browner than-nah that’s an old joke I’ll spare you. 
 
I have to offer Darker than Black something that may seem like praise but I’m afraid is actually a criticism: the sound is the best part. The sound track wasn’t anything special but it earns a passing grade, as do the OPs, EDs and Voice Actors. 
 
What pushes the sound over the edge to “good” is the voices, more specifically Yin’s, more specifically when she says “Hei.” She’s got a throaty rasp that makes me gajizzle in my pazzizles every time. 
 
Damn you’re lucky that this review is more important to me than fapping right now. 
 
CHARACTER 3/10 
 
Hei’s role in Darker than Black and my role in this review have one striking similarity: about 2/3 the way through we both started drinking directly from the bottle. 
 
Hei is your typical character that the author clearly wrote himself into.  Not that I’m denying fantasies, myself having never aged past 6, sometimes I let my imagination run wild and become a superhero or a spy in my mind, god I’m such a loser. Anyways this can be fun but if you write fiction it makes for a weak character. Hei is an empty suit in truest sense of the term, well more of an empty scientifically-impossible-bulletproof-yet-flexible-trenchcoat. I’d like to call him a Mary Sue, but he’s such a non-existent personality that I can’t even bestow that dubious title. There is a plot device to weakly explain away other character’s lack of emotion, but Hei just has nothing. Word of the day is: vacuous, vac·u·ous (Adj) def: Hei. 
 
In the first season, our primary secondary (ha) character is Yin, who is a “doll.” In the Darker than Black universe a “doll” is…actually never fully explained but it means people treat her like a porcupine made of polonium. The other aspect of being a doll is having “no emotion.” Now there is some attempt to write in “emotion” into Yin’s character by having her fall for Hei and having a disjointed personality. But considering this is reflected in Hei’s own lack of depth it really goes nowhere other than somewhere nonsensical, I think. She’s a Rei clone, and a pretty lousy one at that, just like I’m a pretty lousy clone of a version of myself who’s a lot cooler and better than me. I hope this paragraph makes sense to someone other than drunk me. 
 
Yin is boring with no meaningful characterization. 
 
Shion replaces Yin. Shion starts with an incredibly erratic personality, but after an episode or two a plot device steals her interesting points and molds her into another Rei clone; this time with a Barrett coming out from between her prepubescent breasts, for fan-service for people like you, you sick fuck. 
 
Now there are plenty of other characters from Mao to Amber to Kiko. They mainly serve to provide “comic relief” or to confuse the plot even further. A few of them get decent characterization but don’t worry it will all be unraveled by the bizarreness of the endings. 
 
ENJOYMENT 3/10 
 
I’m going to go out on a limb here and say you probably play video games. Who am I kidding, if you watch any anime you almost certainly play video games (and if you’re considering this crappy shit you definitely do). Think back to a below average game. I’m sure you’ve played many bad games, some too bad to keep you for long. But there has probably been one that really wasn’t good at all. When you look back you can’t but acknowledge it was not really to your taste at all, an addictive flash game or an MMORPG for example (any MMORPG, they’re all the same). You can’t say you really enjoyed it but when you look back at the play time it’s like 300 hours or something. 
 
You know the feeling, you never had much fun, but you just kept going in an odd form of absorption in the game. That’s what happened to me with Give Her the D(tB). If I was being completely objective I would have dropped it fast and never come back. But somehow I just kept watching the next episode. I wasn’t interested in the story or the characters or anything, I just kept going. I don’t really know why, I just kept going. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
They say that if you shoot for the moon at least if you miss you’ll land among the stars. Darker than Black shot for the moon, but landed in a hedge. That’s what happens with them fake stars you know. 
 
Darker than Black reminds me of a Republican candidate. It is confused, contradictory and has a poor grasp on science. And it isn’t nearly as intelligent as it thinks it is. There are a lot of fans, but you really aren’t sure who they are. These fans say the message got diluted over time but it’s hard to see how it’s different at all. 
 
I was let down seriously by this anime. Usually when an anime is super popular it’s awful, and some of the not popular ones run the gamut. In between we have the territory of Durarara, Death Note, Code Geass, Darker than Black and their ilk. I’ve gotten used to such anime usually being bad but also usually having something going for them. DtB; however, was a thorough displeasure, no matter what its fans say. 
 
Fuck you, Fuck me, Fuck this anime, Fuck everything.

    Laohoam- the first 6 episodes were alright but after those six it all went down hill or to a parallel world which ever you prefer.  The love triangle was out of the blue, the 11th episode was pointless, and overall it was crazy.  So if you have free time I recommend using it to find another anime to watch. 
 
Tadgh: This thing was a roller coaster. I don't even know what to say. The art style was good, sound quality was good, all the technical stuff was top notch. The story just threw me for loop after loop. All that I'll say is that it has a normal build-up for the first several episodes then it falls into a downward spiral that doesn't stop until it hits bottom. If you have some time with absolutely nothing good to do, give it a whirl, but I certainly won't be checking it out again. 
 
Dr. R Dash: Okay well when we first started this anime from the beginning i knew I was not going to absolutely love this due to the amount of fan service i just don't get into that. But as the show continued and the ridiculous fan service scenes got worse and the story began to unfold i just kept dreading each episode. I was sad how everything ended because it was so blunt and awful I personally did not enjoy this i'm sure there is more info in the manga if there is one but this pony will not go read that manga. the main plot to this anime is don't cheat around on your mentally unstable girl friend... well that's what i got from it at least :/ 
 
Rasanaph- ""Umm...yeah...so...no.""  
 
Brocky: ..........what they said.

    They certainly tried to mold this into a comedy - oh, they really tried!  But this one-shot OVA falls short on so many levels.   
   
I have to believe that whatever studio made this was hoping this would be such a hit that it would turn into a regular series, the way they were name-plating every single character (even if they had just two lines) throughout the show.  Given the time when this came out, it definitely fits within the wackier mold of, say, Dr. Slump or Ranma 1/2.  But this is a far, far cry from Toriyama or Takahashi.     
   
Apparently they thought they could turn a story of students doing wrestling moves in powered armor suits into pure comedy gold.  Only 1) Wrestling is pretty boring 2) Powered mecha suits are even more boring 3) The characters are bland vanilla 4) The story is uncompelling 5) The artwork and animation are about two notches below subpar.     
   
In fact, I would hesitate to recommend watching this for ""trainwreck comedy"" purposes.  I spent about as much time watching the timer on the video ticking down as I was watching the action on the screen.

    This anime is one of the best ones that I have ever seen before in my life. The plot somehow manages to stay incredibly strong throughout all of the 50 episodes, showcasing many different types of characters, from the most comical to the most radically serious. The animation has a very unique style, which somewhat surprised me early on, but then I realized that it simply made the show more unique. 
  
What every viewer must realize first off is that this is NOT just an anime about vampires. The fact that the characters often require blood to survive is used as an effective plot device, but it is not the entire focus of the show. What this means is that it appeals to both those who love vampire animes and those who do not, creating, as a whole, an extremely balanced, well crafted anime.  
 
The anime will be a joy for anyone who watches it. The storyline ranges from romance, to comedy, to intrigue, to detailed pseudo-history, innocence and experience, violence and peace, and then circles around again to the vague but omnipresent romance that insinuates itself, not as the main focus, but as a continuing theme throughout. 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed watching the anime, and I invite all who read this to do the same.

    If you like really f***ing hardcore BDSM, then you will enjoy Bondage Game. 
 
The story for this anime had high potential, but lacked execution. I wish there were more details on the women's past lives. All of them were very likable, especially Yuu and Kaname. I believe the worst thing about the story is the ending. It felt unsatisfying and forced, which is a total bummer. I was left with many questions. This OVA would have greatly benefited from a third episode. 
 
The art style is really ugly, but consistent. If anything, it improves as the show progresses. The character designs are fair. Some of the hentai scenes are very unbelievable and have terrible proportion. The ""acts"" themselves definitely fit the style of hardcore BDSM. At least it is uncensored! 
 
The sound is good. The women aren't all squeakers. The soundtrack is like a horror movie... in a very good way.  
 
I did not enjoy the hentai, but I enjoyed the psychological aspect. It reminds me of a viler (and uglier) Euphoria or a hentai version of the Saw franchise (from the psychological aspect). I found myself wincing at almost every scene. It is definitely not for anyone easily disturbed. This anime receives a 6/10 from me.

    So about 10 hours ago I finished Schwarzesmarken.  
Although it's not the best show of the season, it's the one I enjoyed the most. Surprising considering it goes up against KonoSuba.  
 
Oh and don't stop watching straight after the credits end, there is always an after credits scene which is important to the story.  
 
Historical Authenticity:  I'm not allowed to use the word ""accuracy"" because there were no aliens in Germany. German text appears in place of Japanese when written down and from what I can tell it's very accurate. Ignore that Schwarzesmarken is grammatically incorrect. There is a reason behind that. The end card reads ""Fortsetzung folgt"" which translates to Episode follows (or To be continued as Crunchyroll prefers.)  
Overall from what I had seen the show remains faithful to East Germany, http://i.imgur.com/5E9KJU3.png?1. Aside from changing their plug sockets. 
 
Story: As you know, 1980s East Germany. Poland has fallen leaving them the last barrier to western Europe. They had me caught at 1980s East Germany. I am interested in Cold War history and what is basically fascist rule. I always love the idea of secret police, such as the Stasi. Which is great because who appears in the show? That's right, the Staatssicherheit (German for State Security). I've never watched or played Muv-Luv but I am told politics plays a large role in them as it does in Schwarzesmarken. Remember the aliens attacked humanity? Yeah, they aren't the enemy. The Stasi are. From what I can tell that is the message of the show. The humans are your enemy. It's pretty thrilling. If I was to go any further I would be spoiling the show. Honestly you just need to watch it. 
 
Art and Sound: I've been told the CGI in this show isn't as good as others but it's good enough to look at. It works as well considering the BETA are aliens are shouldn't look like anything on the Earth. As for character designs they are decent enough. As usual in anime the Asian one doesn't look Asian, but she is wonderful anyway. Same with the Polish one. There were two German stereotype girls and Irisdina's hair was pretty to look at. Katia wears too much eye liner.  
As for sound I've been listening to the Ed song, Kanashimi ga Jidai wo Kakeru, while I write the review. It's peaceful. The Op song white forces gets you excited to watch the show and it was well implemented in the final episode. Voice acting was good and I don't think the actors and actresses messed up German pronunciation. There was a stand out song that played in episode 11 which was very epic for the situation. I'll find it hopefully.  
Other than that I can't think of any stand out songs. Maybe I'll find them when I do a rewatch, hopefully that rewatch will be on Blu Ray.  
 
 
Character: We needed two courses/24 episodes. Although I liked the characters as much as I could I still couldn't get attached to all of them.  
Irisdina does have a prequel novel that I don't think has been translated by anyone yet but the show does manage to get you understand her views.  
Theodore Eberbach is our harem leader, except the show never feels like a harem. If you watch the show you will see how the characters interact with each other.  
Katia wears too much eye liner. 
As for the other members of Schwarzesmarken they are good characters and as I said, you will need to watch the show to understand how they interact.  
 
Enjoyment: I was ""excited"" to watch Schwarzesmarken every week. Just like how the people who watched One Punch Man felt.  
As a person that likes politics and ""history"" this show was great for me. It was always tense and after episode 1 it showed how dark and deadly the show can be.  
I enjoyed it so much I want to read the Light Novel and play the Visual novel.  
What's that? It's on Steam Greenlight: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=651346103 
Go vote for it if you want more from the Schwarzesmarken Kompanie. 
They will take that as interest for a second visual novel and a translation for the Light Novel. 
 
Overall: After opening the Steam link and listening to the opening for it I am feeling pretty good. The show has interesting themes and characters. It's a must watch for those that like political drama and the Muv-Luv universe.  
 
In short you should watch it. It was wonderful.

    ((Pretty much the same as the first but stuff added to the end.)) 
 
Girls, naked breasts, and panty shots. Is this what Anime has become? Well, it’s not as bad as Eiken. The artwork is actually mostly tasteful (Ok… it’s not really but at least the girls don’t have breasts the size of body pillows on their chests) and the storyline is actually rather well done. It’s almost like a Romeo and Juliet storyline in parts because the two always seem to be ripped apart by some things. 
 
Let’s start with the characters. Miharu is a little cutesy and a sweetie. Sometimes though, a little too much of the sweet, naive character. She has the traits of an alien character in that she has supernatural powers that sometimes can’t be controlled and the fact that she didn’t know much of Earth. She has a black hole of a stomach since she is always hungry but oddly, some of the things she eats, she does it way to odd. For example, the second episode, she eats a banana rather suggestively. She has no concept of not changing in front of people, mostly in front of Yukinari though. 
 
Koyomi is pretty cute as well and again, is way to naïve. Her background story is actually quite sad. She Has a fear of men but not surprisingly actually is alright with Yukinari after quite a while. She works with the space management office on the planet Seiren where the two are from. Her special agent friend, Tomoka, is actually rather childish and way different then the shy Koyomi.  
 
Kirie is a rather kick ass sporty type, who has a thing for Yukinari (You can see where this is all going). She is the childhood friend of him and sometimes ends up just walking into his house without a care in the world, many times leaving a rather big misunderstanding that ends up hurting Yukinari. Whenever she fights a ‘pervert’ she screams out something ‘in hell’ as she beats the crap out of them. It was fun for a little while, and then got rather old. 
 
Yukinari is… well like every other fucken main character in a Harem! He’s clumsy, small, and not really able to stand out in a crowd. He has an allergy to women though Miharu doesn’t make him brake out at all. Other then that, he is rather sweet and kind, with a wonderful heart. 
 
On the other side of the spectrum is Kazuharu who flirts with every girl around him. He is a pervert who always grabs the girls’ breasts and panties. He is allergic to men though, hence the white gloves that he wears. His sister, Risa, is really into black magic and has a crush on Yukinari. She has a really pushy and throws her servants around to get him to come to her. Now for her servants, Kosame is into Kirie actually. This is actually a new concept I never really saw in another show, especially because it’s a Yuri relationship. 
 
They crammed so much into this show that it’s really jammed with a lot of stuff into it. We got the enter-dimensional transportation, black magic, love triangles, aliens from another world, magical girls, special ops characters, and perverts. We even have a little cute side kick animal named Ebi. Ebi and Miharu have an interesting little relationship much like Excel and her dog.  
 
The artwork is pretty much standard. It’s clean and bright but It just doesn’t stand out much from all the other anime done around this time. It makes it really hard to figure out just what to say every time I review a show that is pretty standard in this area.  
 
The English voices are pretty good, though I feel a bit odd about Miharu’s voice. It’s Michelle Ruff who also played the voice of Ai Sakuraba from Ai Yori Aoshi. Kasuharu Fukuyama is actually played perfectly by Liam O’Brien who did Taishi Kuhonbutsu from Comic Party. Yes, the overactive Otaku is playing the overactive pervert. Not a large difference but it works perfectly for this show. 
 
Season two comes out pretty much the same as the first, though even more perverted. I did like the episode where Yukinari and Kazuharu changed bodies. I really loved how it suddenly turned into a really messed up way where everyone switched with every other person at the swimming pool. The only thing that bothered me was the tentacle rape part.  It was kind of going overboard. 
 
It is here when I figured out why the story plot seemed so disjointed. I found a lot of these episodes were all filler, most of them only going for one episode. It was all made for fan service that sort of gets old at times. That and the stupidity of Miharu seemed to get even more. Still, I couldn’t help but keep watching it, thinking that there may be an underlining storyline for the whole show. There… kind of was but it didn’t show up until episode 17 (6 in the second episode) but there was barely any info about it till Episode 20. Sadly, this only has 24 episodes when adding the two seasons together. 
 
I pretty much see the name as ‘Oh! There are girls naked and sexual innuendos with anime fan service! Bravo!’ or at least that’s what I think the guys are thinking.

    I randomly came across this anime when screwing around on myanimelist and I was shocked by the score this anime had. So because I like to torture myself, I checked the anime out to see whats so bad about this. Now I finally know. Get ready to... duuuh.. do something, this is my review of Tenshi no Drop.   
   
Art: 6/10   
The art is nothing special, but it also not that bad. It is colorful, cute and the animation is fluid. The thing that I can really critique here is that the animation is not good enough for such a short special.   
   
Sound: 4/10   
Wait, there was music? I guess there was.... Don't remember any of it... probably for the best.   
   
Characters: 3/10   
There are characters, but they are extremely one-dimensional with nothing to let them stand out. You have... uh... red haired girl who wants to set up a tea club, you have brown haired girl who exists and you have the purple haired one who is a angel.. I think. There are also two other characters, but they are for 20 seconds on the screen and thats it.   
   
Story: 2/10   
Some girl wants to set up a tea club, a other girl helps her, the floor breaks and another girls appears, the first two girls eat something and then get the ability to shit some other things, The End. So basicly there is no story. It's events that just happen as a excuse of a story. I critisized Yuru Camp in the past for having not really a story, but Yuru Camp is Fate in comparison with this crap.   
   
Enjoyment: 4/10   
I was confused most of the time. It got a few chuckles with its wtf-moments, but the confusement was still too big. They could've done something like Eromanga Sensei: Capitalizing on the negative feelings that you get from it, but instead they did.. something.   
   
Overall: 4/10   
This is the hardest review I have ever written. I basicly made a whole review about nothing. This anime is nothing. It is bad, but you should watch it, because this is one of the best examples how to not do a story.

    Hoo-boy where do I start with this gem? Well, before I even watched it, I knew that I would like it. The premise is amazing, a guy with an overpowered ability. 
The show is an enjoyable ride throughout the entire series (currently 12 episodes), and every episode was filled with laughter. Not to mention the great animation, that create impactful scenes. I can't say too much without spoilers, but I can say the high octane (not to mention very brief) action,  the comedy, and the characters are the reason why I give this anime my seal of approval and  why I also recommend that you go watch it right now. Remember: ONE PUNNNNCHHH!!!

    Gun-Grave is simply a forgotten piece. To large extent there has to be a credit given to the story progression and characters. However, due to few minor miscommunication and intentions by the director misses to be a great anime. Due to how the show concluded I'd gave a little bump for recommendation. I would like to depict my enjoyment and frustration with this show.  
 
The first episode is a insert of later episode around  episode 20ish (its been long since I watched it). Starting show from midst of an action, which brings huge downfall of interest to the plot as it becomes stale. From second episode it picks up with great backstories and serves a great time building up to the climax. But excels at throwing all of that in the trash can, that only the shows closure could come to redeeming its disaster.  
 
Ergo, it does come close to the Phantom Requiem for the Phantom level. But still both over shadowed by Cowboy bebop and such anime at the time. My suggestion is to watch this show if you run out of anime to watch.

    Time to get yelled at for giving this a 10 by some random member of the mal community but frankly, I dont give a shit and i'll tell you why. 
 
Rec was just something I stumbled across (at 2:00 in the morning) and I just figured on watching the first episode and I would see what I thought. I was pulled in automatically and decided to watch the entire series right there on the spot even though it was late at night and I had to be up and 4:30 for work. Lets talk about why I liked it. 
 
Story: Okay a guy gets stood up on a date but meets a new girl as hes about to go storming back home, and upon her apartment building burning down later that night he invites her to stay with him. Throughout the series from here on they kind of tiptoe around a relationship with each other and while other people can see it, they just don't. As such the story is pretty much just them at their jobs and everybody just waiting to see how long it takes for them to realize their feelings for one another. To be honest you know how its going to go the minute you start watching, but I don't think that that is a bad thing. 
 
Art: The show was animated very simply and I think anyone who watches anime should get what I mean by that. They don't waste time with unnecessary details and give us what we need to see so I actually prefer this animation because there's not as much to distract me. 
 
Sound: I usually never talk about sound, and if I do its usually to say it sucked, but not here. The other time I will talk about it is when I think that the voice cast was absolutely perfect for their roles and while many people probably don't pay attention to this, or even care, I really focus on this because if the voice actors don't convince me, i'm done then and there. I especially like the actor for aka onda (the girl) which I thought was humorous since she is a voice actor in the show. 
 
Characters: Never before have I felt that there was a character that I could really relate to, and that all changed with this. Matsumaru is now that anime character that I totally got and related to.  
He works in advertising and he gets to spend time with aka that way due to her job as a voice actress. I also have to say that they are one of the cutest anime couples I have ever seen. Aside from them we have matsumaru's friend and colleague who is funny as hell and aka's manager who is sorta trying harder to make aka and matsumaru's relationship work than they are. Like I said, I liked all of the characters which rarely happens for me. 
 
Enjoyment: ...I gave it a 10, do I really need to say anything else? 
 
Overall: I don't know that I've ever seen an anime that felt so real, and connected with me in such a way as this. I liked everything it had: the story, the humor, and of course the romance. It impresses me how much happens in such a short series, and I will definitely be watching this again, and again. While I don't usually do this, I will make an exception and say that if you are reading this, you need to watch this! Now!

    It has the same Author, Producer, and Writer of Junjou Romantica. It is connected to Junjou Romantica because of the same venue of Marukawa Shoten 
 
The anime is kinda cliche, if you read the manga. 
Some of the characters already appeared in Junjou Romantica. 
 
REVIEW: 
Broken-hearted by his First love at 15, Onodera Ritsu (now 25), leaves his father's company due to his co-worker's jealousy and now works at Marukawa Shoten and is now ready to become independent. Ritsu meets his new boss, Takano Masamune, later on he discovers that Takano turns out to be Saga Masamune (his high school first love). 
 
It's not your typical ""First love never dies"" theme series, you can actually learn lots of lesson from this slice-of-life anime. 
 
The art style is the same as Junjou Romantica. Ritsu is a combination of Shinobu and Misaki. Frankly speaking, This anime is hotter than Junjou Romantica. 
 
I Love the humor of this series and also the plot of the story, it's easy to understand.

       Ping Pong the Animation comes very close to being a masterpiece, but is lacking in the visuals. It is a mixture of hard character development, great action, and in depth look into sports and table tennis.  
 
   The story is perfect for 11 episodes. Everything at the end was concluded; all threads were tied and the viewer is left feeling satisfied. 10/10. 
 
   The OST for ping pong is one of my favorites. The intense opening and ""battle"" themes really set the mood for the action sequences. There are appropriate slower songs for the sad moments, and other niche songs that fit well. Give the soundtrack a listen to after watching it. 10/10 
 
   The characters are what you'd expect from a sports anime: there's ""hero"" who develops his skills due to his persistence and support; the anti-hero who strives for the same goal as the hero, but takes a different path; the sage who guides our hero's, etc. They all fit together nicely, and left me rooting for multiple characters. 10/10 
 
   I enjoyed this anime without any table tennis experience or knowledge prior, and with some experience for my re-watch. 10/10, i cri errytime. 
 
   The animation is the only wavering factor in my mind. Some call it masterful due to its charm that fits the show so well, some call it too low budget that ruins the rest of the experience. I am with the former; however, I accept the criticisms towards it as reality. It may not look that good at first, but after a few episodes, the animation quality isn't worse, just different. 6/10 
 
   Even if you hate sports anime, Ping Pong is still a masterpiece in it's genre. A strong contender for AotY for 2014, and one of my favorite anime I've seen to date. 9.6/10

    The anime can be very misleading at first what you will expeckt is some cute high school romance with abit of drama when u see the intro, but i can promise you that you are up for one hell of a suprise! 
 
 
I have always tought that if an anime makes an inpackt on you then its a sucessful anime, Well this one was one of the sadest and most depressing ive ever seen but i dont care the story was great and it made a big inpackt on me! 
 
In my eyes this anime is unique cause the best thing i know when i watch an anime is to get suprised and i dont want to be able to figure out myself what will happend next, this anime shocked and suprised me more then anyone ive ever seen! 
 
WARNING! if ur sensetive for blood and you get easily depressed then you should not even think about watching it! 
 
It has a well earned spot among my top 10 Romance animes

    Read at your own risk, this review contains mild spoilers. 
For your information: This is NOT a fanboy-ed review of Toradora!. 
Instead, it's my first impressions after finishing the anime. 
 
It's been like 6 hours since I've finished the anime, and I'm still sad (to the point of crying) because I finished it! There hasn't been an anime I enjoyed as much as this one. Since the very start, I was sad because I knew it had to end.  
Toradora gained my heart so much, that it became my #3 favourite anime, above FMAB and under Clannad AS. 
 
Starting with Story, rated 10/10, it's like glue. As soon as you watch the first five episodes, you are lost. You will be immersed in this wonderful, romantic, comedic but also dramatic history. 
*Spoilers ahead* 
After they come back from Kawashima's vacation home, the ambient turns more serious, focusing more and more in the romantic-dramatic side of the story (although in episode 8 when Ami and Taiga swim, after Takasu almost drowns, Aisaka claims that he is hers), we confront Takasu's doubts of who he really loves. Then in episode 16 when Taiga beats down that b*tch from the Council of Students, the anime completely undergoes a drastic change, changing the opening, and the new topic is: achieving goals (so that would be, forcing Takasu to be with Minorin and Taiga with Kitamura). But, will those goals be achieved actually? Oh, them feels and that cliche ending. *End of spoilers* 
 
Art was quite simple yet beautiful. Rated 8/10, I missed some filters and those little details that make an anime enjoyable for our eyes, but the drawing makes it for these smalls details. 
 
Sound was another strong aspect of Toradora. Being used to hear Rie Kugimiya as Happy in Fairy Tail, she has shown me that she can be an amazing little, beautiful, yet aggressive girl. All the seiyuus were perfectly chosen for each role of the anime, and music is simply amazing. 
Openings are ideal just for the context (happy-romantic, and serious-drama-romantic). 
And that song you hear just at the beginning, ""Yasashisa no Ashioto"", gains my heart everytime. I get goosebumps just from hearing it. 
And if you want to cry, hear Lost my pieces. *Spoilers* Oh, that moment where Taiga cries calling Ryuuji. Oh my good lord. That moment made me shed various manly tears. *End of spoilers* 
 
Characters... I loved them all. Yes, no joke. That's why it's rated 10/10. 
I'd say Taiga was my favourite, but she is too much overused so I don't want to sound too stereotipical ^^ haha. But yes, I definetely love her. 
Takasu Ryuuji, I laughed so hard with him, you tend to miss characters like this. No, damn it, you need people like this in real life! 
Also, I loved Ami. Besides being beautiful, she is the most serious and mature character in the series. 
Inko-chan!! At the end we hear this little monster say her name, too bad Ryuuji wasn't there to hear it. 
And then the extras, Noto, Haruta, Kihara, Kashii and specially Yuri, the teacher, make you feel you're really in the school, just watching everything from your point of view. 
 
Enjoyment, rated 10/10. 
I loved this anime from minute 1 of the first episode, until minute 23 of the last episode. Enough said. 
Laughed. Cried like a girl. Got anxious, CRIED because the anime HAD ENDED. 
 
Overall 10/10. 
I would explain more but everything's explained in each specific point. 
 
Goodbye!!

    These are my Reviews if they're helpful great, if not, that's great too. I am NOT adept at writing/typing this is merely a contribution to the site. I assume the reader has finished the show. 
 
Story 
 
Paranoia Agent wants to confuse the hell out of you, unfortunately it's way more simple then it would have you believe. It confuses you and uses outrageous metaphors to deliver the most simple messages. Over and over each episode is delivering the same message in a new way, but it never delivers the plot. Which is basically people mentally breaking from minor life issues and blaming it all on a .. was about to spoil, I mean really it's not that difficult. I believe they forgot to tie in the weak story until the last two episodes resulting in a borderline filler middle and a rushed ending. If only they kept the continuity of the first four episodes my score would be higher because those four had potential! Went and gone off the deep end. 
 
Animation 
 
At first glance it looks great but don't look deeper. As the series progresses the animation and quality of the artwork suffer. This is inexcusable for a 13 episode series. Even though I agree with raising the quality of animation for important sequences only, Paranoia Agent takes a really weird route. Intended or not I wasn't impressed and felt more like they were cutting corners. Towards the end episodes were with cardboard characters.. I fail to see this as creative. If anything the diversity of character designs was the best part. 
 
Sound 
 
When the show decides to be serious it does well to give the viewer a creepy feeling, much thanks to the music. However these moments are so short and grow further apart. It sets the mood for certain situations fulfilling it's purpose but isn't showcased enough. Why? Moments to do so disappear the more Paranoia Agent moves forward. What could have been exceptional is above average when it tries. The opening theme made me feel like I was having a mental breakdown wishing someone would hit me with a bat. The ending theme was pretty damn catchy, but when it's in my head two days later it pisses me off, where's a bat? my problems are too much. 
 
Characters 
 
All the characters had problems in life that weighed on them mentally and would progressively affect their behavior. However in most cases the problem did not make sense of the actions causing them to feel forced and just downright fake. Character development is their to a small degree, a couple I even enjoyed watching. The rest were either cast off too soon or uninteresting from the start, leaving me indifferent to whatever happens to them. New episode, new mental breakdown, some exaggerated reason and BAM! Is that a spoiler? I did think one of the detectives was hilarious even though it's not my kind of comedy. It's not all lost! 
 
Final Thought 
 
Paranoia Agent tries to lighten the story with comedy aimed at a younger ""Shounen"" audience while attempting to maintain it's thought provoking premise. It's been done successfully before but not this time. I'm not sure what exactly it wants to be. Humor was overdone in a attempt to hide how mediocre the show really is. Based off the ratings and reviews it's done that well. I feel like Kira  was writing this story epically eating potato chips when he realized their was only one chip in the bag to begin with :D Let is resonate. Anyway my low score should imply I didn't understand the series right? No, I understood all of it and my score remains the same.

    I agree with some of the comments the story is a bit rushed but the original story from the novel is too touching even a failed attempt to visualise the scene is still too great. The voice actress was great especially the fight vs jiburilu where she did really demonstrate the determination for her to live. I was expecting a bit more on the fights between different clans and how they actually lead the war to end with more details. I genuinely hope that the movie could be extended by 45 mins to explain the story and more fighting. Nevertheless, I would recommend people to watch the anime first before watching the movie.

    Story - There's not much to say about the story, it's pretty clear what's going on, and the plot is always progressing. 
 
Art - Very good, highly realistic. 
 
Sound - The soundtrack reminds me of nazi party propaganda, a real classic! 
 
Character - All characters are extraordinary and unique, in other words, white and racially perfect. 
 
Enjoyment - I came twice in the span of five seconds, and I'd say that's pretty good for a 30 minute video. 
 
Overall - A great experience that I'd like to share with Hitler, Himmler and the other boys. 
 
As a wise man would say ""If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed."".

    This show is amazing. It's been a while since I watched something this amazing. Where has this show been all my life? It's art is gorgeous, but then again, this is Shaft, so what do you expect? xD I might add that despite the lack of moving around in this show, as most of the show is spent with people standing still talking to each other, this show has amazing animation when characters are moving around. Perhaps the best in any series I've ever seen. The music is very very good but very very repetitive, though the way the music goes and all the weird conversations that take place in the show, it can help to be very erm...hypnotic? Still, wonderful music. The show focuses heavy on weird dialogue, and consequently you learn a lot about each of the characters, which really push this show forward. The main character is essentially a somewhat perverted mashochist (I think) who is dating a girl who is a sadist. (The perfect couple, can you imagine?) The main character loves to help people, however his perversions make his morality questionable at times. The sadist girl is very interesting, and a little creepy, as she is very dangerous. There are other characters who get focused on, most of which are interesting, so no worries if you have problems with characterization. This show doesn't have much of a storyline. It instead has multiple stories that span the whole series, each of which revolving around some strange supernatural event causing someone trouble. Still, they are very interesting and sometimes over-the-top, having very violent sudden events occur. Overall, I loved this show, but its not for everyone. It's subbed only, so that's a problem for dub fans. Plus, the price to buy the show is ridiculously expensive, a wopping 150 dollars. To make matters worse for some people, the show might appear dull due to the large amount of dialougue in ther show, not all of which is comprehensible. And finally, some people might be pushed away by the fanservice. Still, I love this show and highly recomended it- It's one of my favorites.

    This is a good show that asks too much of the average fan. 
 
I read the manga back in the Shounen Jump days and really like the art direction and stylization. It is a very fun and easy to follow show, with simple character motivations that all make pretty straightforward sense, except maybe for Nami. The arcs blend together and propel the characters onward, I ALWAYS felt like they were on the correct path and didn't feel like they were just twiddling their thumbs, waiting for the plot to happen. I stopped around episode 100 and don't really care to finish it, I feel like there would be a good plot waiting for me but I could never find a character I connected with on a personal level. The powers all seemed pretty logical and nothing ever seemed to contradict a rule that was established earlier, or if they did, it didn't bother me, as that wasn't the main focus of the story nor did it ever seem to impact whether or not the difficulty spiked for the main characters. 
 
Unfortunately all the characters kind of have the same basic facial structure, with all of them tending to blend together in my mind, so remembering who is who was difficult, which also turned me off and alienated the cast from me, I hated the reindeer, the idea of the setting being a pirate-filled ocean was cool at first but it seemed like most of the story took place on land and they never really ""pirated""... Kind just seemed like the word ""pirate"" meant ""warrior"" or ""fighter"" in this world. Not a huge flaw, but a flaw nonetheless.  
 
It's a good anime and a great manga, but it suffers from too many tropes and lack of individuality to be considered a truly great work of art, to me.

    This Ova was a great addition to the series, but it would have been better if it came out sooner, because a year later I lost my emotions for mirai nikki and i didnt feel too happy when Yuno and Yukki reunited.  
This is defeitly good if you watch this directly after finishing the series. It will make you feel complete. Plus all those people saying the first ending is beter and all that shit. 
News flash the series never ended like that in the manga the Ova was supposed to happen, Only difference is that in the manga Yuno was Alot bigger then Yuki.

    This is my first review! Just thought I'd give my two cents.  
 
I just finished watching Monster today after ~a week of watching. The story is very interesting and really brings up some thoughtful philosophical questions. The beginning started off great, and I really enjoyed it! The last 3/4 was kind of slow, boring, and confusing to me and at first, the ending really disappointed me because I'm not a huge fan of open endings. 
 
Johan's character can be difficult to understand because he never really outright says what his motives are or what he wants: you really just need to infer those from his actions and what everyone else thinks about him. I think that understanding him is key to understanding the ending. 
 
I think this series still leaves quite a few unanswered questions, but I guess that's just normal for something with an open ending. After reading other thoughts on this series as well as reflecting on my own, I've decided on a theory about the ending that I'm happy with. To each their own, I suppose. 
 
I'll give Monster a 9/10. It would be a 10 if the middle wasn't so slow, but otherwise I think this series had an interesting story line, characters, and message. I don't think this anime is for everyone, but I personally enjoyed it!

    It was cute. Mostly.  If you're jonesing for Chobits, in particular, Chii, Sumomo, and/or Kotoko, this is a fine, quick fix of kawaisa.  It's more of the panty fetish, which seems to be a big thing for the anime writers. 
 
However, and let me preface a huge caveat with this:  I love Sumomo.  Dearly.  She's as cute as a button and I'll be the first guy on my block to get me a little Sumomo persocon when they come out. 
 
BUT -  if I EVER saw Sumomo or Kotoko with the horrifying expressions on their faces at the 4:30 mark, I would have no other recourse, but to burn them both, with a Eucharist wafer stuffed in their mouths, and a wooden stake pounded deeply through their adorable little hearts. 
 
And, having seen them like that, and knowing they're even capable of such a look, it's kind of hard to forget it and go back to adoring them.  What has been seen cannot be unseen, and all that. 
 
Why CLAMP would sign off on those four seconds of animation is utterly beyond me.

    Excel Saga is a pure slapstick anime made to do nothing but try to produce a comedy satire of EVERY anime genre made. It actually does a pretty good job making fun of them all. The entire fact that they're just spoofing anime creates a very weak story line. But they do manage to keep a story to keep it all together, albeit full of holes and non seriousness.  
 
Character 
The story mainly follows 2 main characters as they're ""trying to take over the world"" for a company called ACROSS, i forgot what the acronym stood for. The two girls, Excel and Hyatt, all work under a man called Ilpalazzo. The great thing about the two main characters is that they're complete polar opposites of each other. Excel, is your typical over eccentric and stupidly ignorant girl, and Hyatt, is very under eccentric and is actually pretty smart. Its funny in a sense that they are Literally different from each other. They're not the only characters in the show tho. There are at least a good dozen characters that keep reappearing but always displayed in different situations. 
 
Art and Sound 
The art and animation is typical pre-2000 style artwork. Its all kind of lame in my opinion, but they do show their artistic variety in how they have to draw drastically different environments with every episode. The music is forgettable, although you'll laugh at the ED a few times it gets annoying after the 3-4th time listening to it. The op is a little catchy and its a nice touch to have hyatt cough during her singing. 
 
Enjoyment 
The best part of the anime is the line execution or the script. The use of the word ""Shock"" and the running joke of her eating her dog among all the other hundreds of jokes makes this show stand out so much. The simplistic lines flow very well with the simple artwork and characters. They even go far as copying characters from from digi charat, to fist of the northstar, to shinesman (you'll think its power rangers but its really a spoof off of Shinesman), really show the voice range and artistic range albeit a little simple. 
 
Overall 
This show does have its high points but its also with its downsides. If you're really into anime comedy, then this would be a good pickup, but even if you're not into the comedy genre it still would not be bad to pickup and watch since there is the possibility of you seeing one of your favorite ""classic"" anime or genre get spoofed. You'll see jokes coming from lolicon to androids, to poverty jokes, you'll see a little of everything here. It's definitely a different style of comedy and Nabeshin's comedy style transfers very well to his other work, Nerima Daikon Brothers. This anime is not for most people but you'll enjoy the ending

    You can’t talk about Dennou Coil without talking about Digimon Tamers. They don’t just use a similar technique to tell their stories. Their stories revolve around the same theme. The ending also includes a girl trapped in a visualization of grief. It never feels like a rip off. Both shows wanted to explore a subject that needs exploration, and found different inspirations. 
 
The core difference between the two is the mode of storytelling. Tamers was a heroic journey, but Coil is closer to something like Mushishi. It’s more concerned with the world it created and what it means. 
 
Nature is odd, but so is technology. At some point, inventions become so advanced we can’t predict their behavior. Even the most simple ones contain surprises. They often spin out of control, and the internet is the perfect example of this. 
 
Do the people who invented the internet thought it would be used to exchange Japanese cartoons, cat photos and have people’s suicide notes on them? The internet is now out of our control. It’s a constantly-changing frontier, with pages being born and dying. It’s a way to connect to others, where bullshit rumours spread and where you can escape your reality. 
 
The technology in this show is just a visualization of this idea. It juxtaposes the exploration of the virtual frontier and the physical one. You might think kids today are all just stuck on their computers, but weren’t the astronauts stuck on exploring the moon, rather than the Earth? 
 
Space is not the final frontier. The internet is another one, but it’s one that we create. The spaces weren’t here before. Every piece of data was created by someone else, a product of their thoughts. Exploring the internet is exploring what others think, whether you’re looking for funny pictures someone uploaded, their writings or stuff they thought was cool and reblogged. I think once someone said we are the final frontier. If this is true, then the internet is how we explore it. 
 
The kids in this show may seem too independent,but this isn’t a plot device. Kids on the internet are often more independent and loose than outside of it. If you play outside, your mom can still look out the window and see what you’re doing. If you go somewhere, she’ll want to know where. 
 
It’s easier to build an independent culture when you’re on the internet. Close the door or minimize the window when mom comes in. If she doesn’t know the address, she’ll never know what’s going on. Even if she does, you’re creating a new identity she might not recognize. 
 
The new culture the kids have built in Dennou Coil isn’t alien. I’ve seen it happen myself. I remember those message boards that were the beginning of Nerdom in my country. I still see communities with a distinct identity in message boards or video games. 
 
Here, we got a physical reality along it. So the rivalries aren’t just name-dropping in forum posts but the old fun of shooting each other. That’s something people do online all the time. They shoot cyber-avatars of other humans. 
 
These avatars can be convincingly real, even when they were just pixels. That’s the problem with the internet. A lot of it appears real, and the line between reality and the virtual blurs. Maybe it doesn’t exist at all. Densuke only appears when you put your cyber-glasses, but you can only see Jupiter with a telescope. Densuke is not a real, biological dog. A real dog is also not a virtual one. What makes one dog better than the other? 
 
Both dogs actually exist. Both respond to us. Even a virtual pet in an RPG game responds to your actions. The fact one is manmade isn’t much of a difference. Dog breeds are an invention of men. The difference is that the virtual world is full of data and information, but nothing sensory. 
 
Stuff on the internet is not something you can feel. That’s why some people can be social on message boards but socially neurotic in real life. Densuke is a virtual dog and will never be a real one. If we try to program humans, they will just be virtual versions. They will never be a real human. 
 
Grief does its thing, though. It messes with our minds, and we want more to find a new reality where the event didn’t happen than find good in our reality. A character gains the option of creating her own reality without the death of a close person. 
 
A purely man-made reality is nothing, though. Nothing is purely man-made or exists on its own. A reality where nothing is connected is barren and dry. This is the same world of the D-Reaper. A grieving person can’t escape into his world. He’ll just dive deeper into his own sadness. 
 
All we create is just a reflection of us. Isako couldn’t re-create with her brother. She could enjoy a projection of him, something similar. It’s not the real thing, and in the end it’s not a proper replacement. Things can’t be replaced with second hand versions. 
 
If this sounds like it’s too heavy for children, then you’re not paying attention to the best of children’s fiction out there. Children deal with loss. Their stories need to address it. 
 
While Dennou Coil treats it with maturity and empathy, it falls short of Tamers. Its technology is more imaginative and conceptually deep. The Digimon are a plot device, but the idea of a ‘virtual reality’ isn’t explored. Tamers kept the technical stuff at bay. At too many instances the mechanics of the virtual reality will be explored. None of it is ever coherent. It’s just a physical manifestation of the internet and that’s it. 
 
Dennou Coil also sports a problematic art style. There is a great difference of creativity in the character design and the virtual reality design. The designs of anything virtual are beautiful. They’re simple, but the little details are excellent. The Illegals’ black, blurry body, Densuke’s round shape, Oyaji’s lack of mouth and small eyes are all details that stick out. 
 
The character design does the minimalist-realist Mushishi did. It’s not as bad as that one. They find subtle details to give them personality, but too often they feel dry. Auntie is supposed to be the beautiful character, yet nothing about her looks significantly different than the others. 
 
Two episodes are noteworthy. One is the comic apex of the series. It’s a brief history of humanity as if they were the hairs that compose a beard. The episode is complete with a bearded old lady. The other episode comes right after it, and is actually the most psychologically deep one of the series. The climax isn’t as powerful as Tamers’ D-Reaper. In that episode, it is. If only they could use the ideas there, reshuffle them and make a different climax. 
 
Even if it doesn’t manage to reach the heights of Digimon Tamers, it comes close. It’s not treading the same grounds. It uses the same tools to tell an equally deep story with its own take on things. In some places, it’s weirder and bolder. Anyone who wants to see how good children’s fiction can be should watch this.

    All it took was a small trip to my local anime store that was having a 2-for-1 special for secondhand DVDs for me to come across a series which I'll always hold a special place for in my heart, a programme which was no doubt an emotional roller-coaster that was a harrowing tale of love and loss. Unfortunately, that very programme suffers from a *very* lacklustre beginning. What is this programme you ask? Why it's none other than Clannad: After Story and its lacklustre beginning is this very season. 
 
It's no secret that us Desi folks get pretty damn melodramatic and sentimental at times. We LOVE the shit out of our romances and melodramas. Can you name ONE Desi person who hasn't cried once whilst watching Kal Ho Naa Ho or Baghban? Okay, maybe the younger folks don't have a taste for that stuff but I certainly do (and so do my parents... who like to kick me out of the house every time we watch Baghban together because of the infamous guilt trip that movie begets).  
 
What does all this shit have to do with anything? I don't know, but one thing's for certain: this season of Clannad is a romantic melodrama to the core and yet it completely failed at eliciting an emotional response out of me a good majority of the time (which is a feat in and of itself given my tastes). Regardless, this season ain't all bad. In fact, I really did like it but I didn't find it ""poignant,"" ""compelling,"" or ""heartbreaking"" like the back of the DVD box says it is. 
 
***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING*** 
 
Clannad follows the story of Tomoya Okazaki, a delinquent high school student who hates where he lives because it's full of too many painful memories and his adventures with several other girls, each with their own sets of problems that he needs to help them solve. However, there's another event happening in different world as Tomoya et al are going about their lives: a girl who is the last of her kind all alone on an unknown world builds a companion out of junk who wants to help her leave this place before the winter comes and eventually takes her life. How do these stories connect? Tune in to find that out and MORE on the next episode of... DRAGON BALL Z!!!! 
 
In case you haven't noticed by now, this is the third instalment of a series of visual novel adaptations produced by Kyoto Animation and KEY Visual Arts and a hallmark of these visual novel adaptations is a seemingly mundane setting mixed together with a supernatural element of sorts which gradually becomes more important as the series progresses. Now I haven't seen (nor do I have any interest in) Air or Kanon (2006) but I can safely say this: if you are NOT a fan of moe, inadvertent harems, supernatural stuff in your slice-of-life programmes, or moe drama... you probably won't like Clannad which is a real shame because After Story is definitely several leagues above this season but I digress. 
 
As for the concept and how it's explored... well, it isn't explored very much here (or all that much in After Story... oddly enough). The first episode literally starts with an opening monologue from Tomoya who says ""I hate this town, it's too filled with memories I'd rather forget."" What are these memories that he'd rather forget? Why is his relationship with his father strained? None of these questions are answered at all and whilst After Story does a good job of cleaning up those loose plot threads, there are still some questions left unanswered as the show puts more focus on the story of Tomoya et al in the here and now rather than explaining what happened in the past. 
 
This is more or less the case throughout the entirety of Clannad for various plot threads, especially given how it puts more emphasis on the stories of certain girls but then throws everyone else to the wayside as the anime adapts that particular girl's arc from the visual novel. Remember Nagisa? You know... the girl that Tomoya meets that one fateful day at the beginning of the first episode? She's no better than a supporting character for the bulk of this season. The same goes for Kyou, you know... that tsundere twin who Tomoya should call Jacoby and Meyers on? Granted, After Story DOES put in some work to fix this, but it's too little too late by that point. 
 
***THE STORY*** 
 
Considering the fact that Clannad is a visual novel adaptation (a romance visual novel adaptation at that), it's no surprise that there is an inadvertent harem that forms over the course of the series and that Tomoya is the only useful guy around for the bulk of this programme's run. Unfortunately, that's my biggest problem with the story of Clannad. As far as visual novel adaptations go, it isn't exactly a cut above the rest of its competition when it comes down to execution for a variety of different reasons. 
 
For one thing, there are certain nuances which make perfect sense in a visual novel context but when translated over to an anime context, they work to its detriment. If you need a good example of what I'm talking about, look no further than the way that the characters are handled. Visual novels are fundamentally designed in such a way where certain characters and arcs are often thrown to the wayside based on the route you choose to play through. In an anime context, that nuance doesn't work well and is often considered to be poor/lazy writing. This especially works to its detriment when we're talking about how each of the girls' arcs are adapted. 
 
In short, KEY's visual novels were never meant to be adapted in a linear fashion. This is a ROMANCE visual novel adaptation. You know that Tomoya would've hooked up with the girl whose arc was being adapted by the end of it all, and yet somehow this show still gives off the vibe that Tomoya and Nagisa are going to end up together (spoilers: they do). Now this didn't really bother me that much since I understand the context of the adaptation but that still doesn't change the fact that these problems could've easily been avoided had there been more foresight. I mean, why didn't Tomoyo and Sunohara have a romantic subplot which actually adapted her arc of the visual novel? In hindsight, that would've worked a lot better rather than having Tomoya move over to Tomoyo once he was through with Kotomi's arc. There are WAY more instances like that than I let on, by the way. 
 
The supernatural aspect of Clannad is also something that a great many people end up taking umbrage with and I definitely understand that sentiment as it DOES get rather ridiculous at times. There is a way to do supernatural stuff in drama right (look no further than the 1990 film, Ghost), but this doesn't apply to Clannad or the rest of the KEY visual novel adaptations whatsoever. At the same time, the supernatural elements of Clannad become far less prevalent as the series progresses (even moreso in After Story) so it's not as bad as it would initially seem. What is present however is intrusive enough to deter prospective viewers from giving this series a proper chance. 
 
The last thing that I want to talk about when it comes down to the story of this season is the fact that it plays out more like an archetypal moe drama. We're presented with a bunch of cute girls who are then swiftly beaten with the angsty crowbar until they end up like Jason Todd and then they turn into cardboard cut-outs for the viewer to project their fantasies of consoling and/or fucking vulnerable girls. As ugly as that sounds, it's the truth and no amount of pathos, gorgeous animation, endearing character quirks, and funny/heartwarming moments can ever change that.  
 
It's all about eliciting an emotional response out of the viewer and because of this, nothing about this season feels genuine. Can the same be said about After Story: NO. Unfortunately, first impressions tend to last forever and as far as first impressions go... Clannad fails to leave a strong one and in many cases, the fact that this season is so underwhelming has actually caused MANY to not even bother giving After Story a chance which is a genuine shame. Oh well, such is life as I like to say. 
 
***THE CHARACTERS*** 
 
I really want to know it's possible to have such a large cast of characters but then make it so blatantly obvious that by the end of it all, only two people will ultimately matter (it also doesn't help that one of those people was quite heavily criticised for being grossly unrealistic). There were so many characters that I genuinely did find interesting like Kotomi, Tomoyo, and Sunohara but the geniuses at Kyoto Animation and KEY were basically all like ""Hey, you know those interesting characters we have that might very well be compelling individuals? Let's NOT use them to their full potential!"" Well, what we got is what we got so there's no sense in complaining about that now is there? Anyway, I'm just going to cover Tomoya, Akio, and Nagisa because that's what I wanna do. Don't like it? Well fuck off, I don't need your negativity here. 
 
When it comes down to saving graces, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone else like Tomoya who fits the bill and then some. I'll say this right now: Tomoya's character is flawed to high heaven in season and it really isn't until After Story where he truly does shine. Regardless, Tomoya is still a rather likeable individual in this season and it's quite evident that he grows and changes as an individual from the first episode all the way to the end. His constant snark never ceases to make me chuckle and out of the entire cast of Clannad, Tomoya feels the most human. Like I can actually believe that Tomoya is actually a real high school student who's been through a lot of crap in his life and simply lacks motivation. That's about as best as I can describe him anyway. 
 
Another saving grace that Clannad has is Akio, Nagisa's father. To put it short, any moment where Akio was on-screen was more than enough to make me smile and laugh raucously when the time was appropriate. I don't really have much of a fondness for the loud, hammy type but Akio is DEFINITELY an exception. Furthermore, there are actually times when he stops being the large ham and is actually capable of carrying on moments of drama rather well which is surprising since most comedic relief characters I've come across are brainless morons when it comes down to drama. With that said... not everything about Akio is all sunshine and rainbows. If you wanna know what I'm talking about, look no further than his offspring: Nagisa. 
 
I'll just say this right now: if you're not fond of idealised girlfriend characters, you're probably going to hate Nagisa. I'll admit that of all the girls introduced throughout Clannad, Nagisa has to be the most boring of them all and yet she ended up being Tomoya's choice by the end of it all. I don't hate Nagisa whatsoever, in fact... I do quite like her. At the same time, it's the fact that we don't know as much about Nagisa in comparison to Tomoyo and Kotomi. People like to rag on Nagisa saying that barring her insecurity, she's an otherwise flawless character and I don't think that's entirely true. 
 
Insecurity in and of itself is a powerful flaw which can bring an otherwise perfect character down to reality and make them easier to connect with (ref: Belldandy from Ah! My Goddess) and in Nagisa's case, it does seem to work the same way. However, even though we know that Nagisa is a flawed individual, we still don't know much else about her. All we really know about her is that she's sickly crybaby with low self-esteem who happens to like the Big Dango Family and anpan/tonkatsu. Like really? Come on... With that said, it's not like she's without her redeeming qualities (outside of being so moe and adorable). 
 
The biggest redeeming quality that Nagisa has is the fact that she's the catalyst for Tomoya's growth as a character across the entirety of Clannad (including After Story!). It really does sound cliché and cheesy, but there are delinquents who actually change for the better because of a girlfriend or whatever. In Tomoya's case, it was Nagisa who was that very reason for him to change. It's quite obvious that Tomoya had a rather strained relationship with his father and had no ambitions in life and that chance encounter he had with Nagisa in the first episode was all it took for him to start bettering himself. Sure, the other girls definitely had a part to play but their roles weren't anywhere near as big as Nagisa's in Tomoya's life.  
 
***THE ART/ANIMATION*** 
 
The first thing that you'll probably notice is the fact that pretty much ALL of the girls in Clannad are moe. Big eyes that are as large as the human forehead, tiny noses and small mouths, high-pitched voices, and the like are all prominent in KEY/Visual Arts (and by extension, most of Kyoto Animation's catalogue)'s work. If you can't look past that one particular detail, you'd do well to stay away from Clannad and opt for a different series like Kimi ni Todoke, ef: A Tale of Memories, Toradora, or Fruits Basket. However, if you happen to know that Clannad is one gigantic moe festival and you still want to keep going, that detail won't bother you all that much. 
 
From an artistic standpoint, Clannad has some of the best background artwork I've ever seen (no surprise there, this IS a KyoAni project after all). Everything is beautifully detailed and if I'm not mistaken, several parts of Clannad's overall setting were adapted from actual locations in Japan which is always a nice treat. The actual animation quality can be of variable quality however. There was just something about the character models that seemed a bit off from time to time, like one arm would be shorter than the other. Get what I mean? 
 
There may very well be a good reason for that, as there are segments of Clannad that take place in an illusory world of sorts with a girl who's the last of her kind and her junk robot companion. Those segments were animated ENTIRELY in CG and it's absolutely GORGEOUS. Seriously, no lie. Most of the time, CG in anime would be horrendously clunky and have stilted animation (ref: Gantz, Knights of Sidonia) but I can safely say that it's not the case with Clannad whatsoever. The animation is fluid and has just as much detail if not MORE detail than the rest of the series does. Talk shit all you want about how these segments are unnecessary but the fact remains that they're quite the visual delectation. 
 
***THE SOUNDTRACK*** 
 
OST-wise, Clannad delivers quite well. Every track that Clannad has to offer on the OST (barring the OP/ED for obvious reasons) fits whatever moment it's being played in extremely well. If I really had to pick an individual track that stood out to me the most througout the entirety of Clannad (this includes After Story, by the way), it would definitely have to be ""Yuki Nohara"" (Eng: Snowfield). It's a track that never ceases to bring me to tears for reasons that I'd love to tell you about but that would be a MASSIVE spoiler on my part and I dare not do such a thing. 
 
The OP theme ""Megumeru"" by eufonius isn't a bad OP theme by any means, but it's certainly one that I don't really like listening to all that much because the theme itself sounds rather off-key from time to time. Like really... whose bright idea was it to even bother using this OP track in the first place if it sounds like that? The ED theme ""Dango Daikazoku"" by Chata is a different story. Whilst it's not an appropriate ED theme for some of the more dramatic episodes, it's still a nice song nonetheless (which later ends up being part of one of the most adorabe/heartwarming moments of After Story for... reasons). 
 
***THE DUB*** 
 
Both seasons of Clannad get shit for the dub because this season was directed by none other than the infamous Steven Foster. I'm not completely familiar with why this man gets a lot of hate for his dubs (probably because I haven't watched a lot of ADV/Sentai dubs that had him as the ADR director), so I can't really say whether or not this is one of his better dubs. What I can say though is that this dub receives WAY too much crap than it deserves. The entire cast does an absolutely spectacular job with the roles they've been given. It's also rather faithful to the original without sounding like weeaboo fan fiction in the slightest. Most importantly though, it still manages to capture the feel of Clannad even though it's dubbed which definitely nets a few points in my book. 
 
However, there's no shortage of otherwise insignificant problems combining together which sours the overall experience. A few awkward line translations, a line delivery which sounds a bit off, mispronounced names, inconsistent usage of honourifics titles, etc, these are all problems that on their own wouldn't do much harm but when you lump them all together and have it directed by a much-maligned member of your staff... it's no surprise to see why people hate on this dub. Even so, I feel as though the good outweighs the bad when it comes down to the dubbing. 
 
For one thing, I love how the voice actresses don't do that archetypal high-pitched moe voice that I don't really care much for to begin with when voicing the female characters. Don't get me wrong: Luci Christian, Hilary Haag, and Emily Neves sound cute voicing their respective characters, but they don't go out of their way to sound moe which is all fine and dandy in my book. The highlights of the cast are easily David Matranga as Tomoya, Luci Christian as Nagisa, Andrew Love as Akio, and Greg Ayres as Sunohara. I'm biased toward David Matranga's performane though, but that's mostly because his performance reminded me of his work as Tohno in the 5 Centimetres per Second dub (which coincidentally is another Steven Foster dub, a GOOD one, mind you). 
 
Does the dub beat the sub? I wouldn't necessarily say that but it's certainly a LOT better than people make it out to be. If you're debating which one you should watch, I'd say it boils down to whether or not you want to hear moe when you're watching the show. If you want moe, go with the sub but if you don't want moe, stick with the dub. 
 
***FINAL THOUGHTS*** 
 
Clannad as it stands is fairly underwhelming but at the same time, it was definitely an enjoyable experience and it left a good-enough impression on me to the point where I actually wanted to see what would happen next in After Story. Even if you don't wanna check out After Story because you think it's overrated or whatever (which it kind of is, but that's beside the point), this season if Clannad is fairly entertaining in its own right. The comedy was spot-on most of the time and even though nothing really felt genuine about Clannad in the slightest, the final few episodes were more than enough to actually make me forgo watching the show with my brain and got me to watch it with my heart instead... cheesy though that might sound. 
 
If you come out of this season underwhelmed and feeling like you want your money/time back, I highly urge you to watch After Story. As lacklustre as this season is, After Story is way more than enough to make up for it and then some. If you don't wanna give After Story a chance regardless... well, go onto the next section for another stuff that might suit your taste a little better. 
 
***ALTERNATE *MANGA* RECOMMENDATION*** 
 
I'm only able to provide one recommendation for Clannad because I have WAY more stuff to recommend for After Story than I do this season. Go ahead and watch Air, Kanon, Angel Beats, or Little Busters if you want more of the same from KEY and KyoAni/PA Works though. 
 
1) Fruits Basket 
- I'm recommending the manga over the anime for the simple reason that the anime was cut off before the manga ever reached its prime. Fruits Basket by and large is a paragon of its craft when it comes down to shoujo romance (and romantic drama in anime/manga in general). Much like Clannad, it has a rather lacklustre beginning but that quickly changes as the series turns into a harrowing tale of love and emotional hardship. Shameless plug for Fruits Basket review here: http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=167669 
 
***AFTERWORD*** 
 
If you're planning on buying Clannad at all, be that this season or After Story, I urge you to buy the Blu-ray release instead of the DVD releases of the complete collection for the simple reason that the DVD releases come on those shitty spindle cases which force unnecessary wear on the discs and cost WAY too much given the price of the set altogether. It would be wise to buy Clannad whenever it's on sale at Right Stuf or Amazon, because Sentai's Blu-ray releases tend to be rather pricey. I mean, I got my copies of the DVD releases on sale and I can safely say I got what I paid for but still... why can't Sentai just package their shit normally like Funimation does? Oh well...

    I've been looking forward to watching this for a little while now, so I do have a little hope and good expectations going into it. 
 
Sora and Shiro are adorable together, it's nice to see close siblings. Not weird close, just usual loving close... mostly. 
It's very bright and colourful, I think that's supposed to enhance the feeling that they're inside a game, which isn't really needed, but it's nice. It makes the art style different, which is usually always appealing. The colours are actually charming to me. 
 
They are both really intelligent people and use it in little sly ways to benefit themselves. Plus for the whole point of the story, to win the games.  
They make a friend in Stephanie, so she gets their help as well, sometimes to be nice, sometimes if it gives them an advantage. 
 
The world has 10 pledges or rules, and they cannot be broken or you'll be punished. But that doesn't mean you can't work around them or twist them to your success, if you're clever. 
Having conquered their own world in gaming, they're excited to find something new to challenge them.. To bring the 16 races together and to become Kings. Even maybe Gods? 
 
The Ecchi is good, it's not forced or out of place so it fits. Stephanie and Shiro are a good choice of character for it too, then with Jibril joining too. Adding someone other than Sora's sister takes the weirdness away.  
Shiro's character type is pretty common, but I really like her. Her personality and look are a great match and I love it. 
 
It is funny, it kept me entertained from the first episode and I really enjoyed it. The characters are cute and funny, the story is different so it's interesting, the art style is different but nice.  
It takes some turns that you definitely wouldn't expect.  
 
If cute girls, games, complex thought patterns and genius characters are your thing, this is definitely worth watching.

    Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? 
 
Steins;Gate 
 
Because it's full of holes. 
 
Yes, it was very enjoyable. And yes, it's much better and smarter and more sophisticated than a lot of anime out there. 
 
But it could have been even better. 
 
Steins;Gate didn't live up to it's potential. What it gave us is only a fraction of what I think it should have. Why do I say this? 
 
Well, for an audience that doesn't watch much sci-fi, this is an amazing anime. I'd highly recommend it to anybody that isn't really into science-fiction as a taster. 
 
But if you watch or read sci-fi; or if you even have a basic high-school knowledge of Physics, you'll be picking out holes in this series every episode. The number of paradoxes created, and the amount of stupid crap spouted by some of these characters was enough to ruin the show for me. (CERN? Seriously? Dystopian future world controlled by CERN? Do they know anything about the scientific world whatsoever?) 
 
The series starts slow, but it operates and moves at a good pace. The main character Okabe Rintarou, is ear-grindingly annoying at first, coming across as incredibly forced fan bait.  
 
But eventually things start to pick up, and it's during the final quarter of the anime that it really begins to shine. The soundtrack is amazing, the characters are deep and structured and layered, and anime will have you feeling fulfilled and whole by the twenty-fourth episode. 
 
It's a shame that it couldn't reach it's potential. But what we got wasn't bad at all.

    I made this account to write this review, because sometimes even the world's greatest defender needs defending. The thing is, I wouldn't think twice about about giving this anime a 10, and that's the point. The total score isn't even necessarily a sum of its individual factors. It's not an anime that requires a great deal of thinking. Not everything good in this world does or should. To denounce OPM because of this is the conclusion of an overly critical mind. 
Some call this a love/hate series, but as seen by the many 5-8s, this is not entirely accurate. What I think is it's a love/look-down-on series. Some love it, and others find it good or average or trash but consider it inferior to animes with intricate methods of storytelling. To disregard OPM for its innocent nature is to do yourself and the show a great disservice. There is a saying which you've likely heard: ""It takes all kinds to make the world go 'round."" This is true in all things, equally true for art as it is for people. Does OPM have the same style of masterful storytelling as HxH, or the same gripping, meticulously thought out plot of Monster? No. Does it need to? Hell no. In fact, it is better without it. What a viewer should instead ask is: Does OPM achieve what it sets out to do? That answer is yes. By god, yes, and to a degree that is equalled only by other animes crafted with similar lev 
els of mastery. This show is mindless fun with lots of heart and production value. What it aims to do is simply be enjoyed. And I'll squeeze it in here, Genos is a great character and Saitama is hilarious and badass. 
Now, if the reason you don't like this anime is because you don't agree with its humor, that is something I cannot objectively argue. Personally, I think its style of parody fits the show perfectly. But I will say that although humor is by far its most prominent element and the mechanic which drives the show, it is again doing the anime a disservice to say it has nothing else going for it. In addition to the well-built action, the simple, childlike nature of a story which is about heroes who want to protect mankind from destruction is presented in a continually inspiring way by the second half. Saitama's development from Hero-For-Fun to self-proclaimed, largely unrecognised defender of the world's justice really gets me. Again, I'm not claiming there is any masterful storytelling here, but if you can't find inspiration in it then embrace your inner-child and general giving a shit about the betterment of mankind and watch the show again. These themes are presented well to say the least. 
This deeper meaning to an otherwise comedic story teamed with its passionate, skillful direction, outstanding acting (in the Japanese), and 11/10 production value makes it a masterpiece in my books. Albeit a peculiar, goofy masterpiece, but IMO that only makes it as brave as its hero who reminds us that, in the end, good will always triumph over evil, and the world is worth protecting. You don't need to think too much about that.

    Since the first time I heard I was not interested, but just changed my mind after I saw her. 
 
No Game No Life is an interesting anime, it is noteworthy that the work itself to a good complexity that is very well explained in its minimum detail, the plot addressing many concepts and even is little philosophical at times, the mood this course and obvious and a lot of fun, the characters show this charisma in anime of its kind accompanied by a beautiful art that reaches bother, resembling a rainbow (it's a rainbow). 
Overall it's an anime with a great history, a great fun, even little problems presented in its plot and rhythm problems, most end up becoming trivia things, but that still bother a bit more than not spoil your bottom line.

    im not really into the big long review about art style and justifying my rating i dont really read the whole thing unless i am becoming obsessed with the anime and even then nope. so i just gonna cut it short and say that everyone is different and this anime to me has a few moments where you want to watch but in a way u dont then after that it just gets amazing i would give it a boarder line 10 because it is amazing but some parts are dragged out a little to much, note to those who have seen it it could have ended with kai ,saya and the to babies wlking thru the generations,( just cus would be cool and the thought of kai as an old man frightens e when saya is 17 looking

    This is one of the most intelligent anime I've watched in some time. 
 
The protagonists, severely handicapped technologically, manage to pull off victories in seemingly impossible situations using an understanding of basic physics and a great eye for situational analysis. It all makes sense and you can actually figure out the solutions yourself if you are smart enough. Enough information is presented for you to come to the same realisations that the MC does. 
 
The political situation, while not explained at great length, also conforms well with what we see in the real world. The motivations for war presented here are all too real.

    Tyrannical power and glory are two things that define a sovereign ruler with an iron fist. Many mythologies have been interpreted to fit these notions into their stories to create a different understanding of them. A series that has been long regarded with acclaim by many die-hard enthusiasts is the Fate series. Starting as a visual novel series, it eventually shifted its form to animation with Fate Stay Night to mediocre reception from fans. It was then that a man named Gen Urobuchi decided to make a prequel light novel series called Fate Zero, and thus a legendary phenomenon was born in animation form four years later. 
 
Though this is the 2nd season of Fate Zero that I’m basing this off of after finishing it, it would be more tempting to critique it as a whole. Because it is merely a continuation of the series and nothing else. Do not feel disingenuous if you feel like you want to read the visual novels before going into it, or suffer through the horrible Fate Stay Night adaptation. Fate Zero is, by and large, its breed and it wouldn’t necessarily warrant a lesser experience had one not experienced any of them. Going through the entire series to the inevitable conclusion, Fate Zero manages to pull off a strong emphasis on technical beauty and wonder; while it falls short on some levels. 
 
I remember when I first got introduced to the Fate series and couldn’t make heads or tails on what it was about from looking at the plot summaries. Once you dive into it and it starts to explain in great detail about the ongoing war over the holy grail, it does make it more coherent, even if you haven’t followed the visual novel to death. Fate Zero does a great job of explaining it from the first episode alone, which has a running time of an hour. Following the footsteps of several of our protagonists and their goal of achieving the holy grail, they are all given pretty substantial screen-time for us to empathize with their competitive drive against one another. 
 
Now this screen-time I mention comes from the pacing this show has with not only how we can identify with the characters, but also to showcase their unique fighting abilities. I’ll give a lot of credit to the animation studio, ufotable, and bringing out their big guns into the production of Fate Zero. It also helps that they worked on a massive budget that they were able to work around, which is a rarity in this day and age. Their attention to detail in the color schemes, especially in the darker moments, is very astounding to look at. It’s one of those instances where it is mandatory to watch this is the full high definition to get involved with the creative detail of the art and animation. 
 
With animation comes to action scenes, which Fate Zero is not afraid to show, with true greatness. What is quite refreshing to see in an action scene is for characters to plan out their attack moves instead of just swinging their weapon until the enemy dies. Even so, it doesn’t needlessly pad out the fighting scenes with constant dialogue in-between, at least most of the time. Visually exciting and epic in its ultimate nature, these will not disappoint your average action show fan. 
 
Epic storytelling has its roots in having a large cast of characters in it. The characters in Fate Zero are, unfortunately, hit or miss depending on the progression we get from the development they have. This includes the relationship we have with the human characters and the servants that protect them. The best example is the relationship between Rider and Waver based on the level of chemistry these two have whenever they are bickering between one another. However, the rest didn’t speak to me as having great chemistry, only because their only purpose is to advance the plot and nothing else. With Rider and Waver, it felt like I was rooting for these people more to win the war because they bolster so many lighthearted moments that make them appealing to watch. 
 
Saber gets a lot of praise as being a strong character, and I do understand that from the perspective that she knows how to protect herself and her master. Other than that, she doesn’t carry the show all on her own because of her bland personality, and all she does is tries to get her honor back, which feels so superficial. This is the case for most of the characters, except for Kiritsugu Emiya, in Fate Zero. Style with no substance is what I would generalize my point as for them. It could very well be the problem with adaptations that don’t expand enough for people like me who hadn’t read the visual novel, but that is hardly an excuse if you think about it. 
 
The worst instance I can give for this is the characters Caster and Ryunosuke. Both of them are pure psychopathic murderers that take pleasure in killing children just for the fun of it and nothing else. That should not entail that I take these characters as bad only on the premise that it's completely unnerving or unsettling. What troubles me is that that’s all that we get out of Caster and Ryunosuke. We don’t know what makes Ryunosuke turn into the person that he is, and most of the blame can be put on him since Caster is already based on a real-life serial killer. They are there to emit shock value into the mix to make the show somehow more “adult” when it doesn’t matter in the slightest, not that this was the first for Gen Urobuchi. 
 
Nevertheless, the character development kicks into high gear when we explore Kiritsugu Emiya’s troubled past. The only negative aspect to this is that the two episodes that chronicle his past felt unnecessary in the main broadcast and would’ve fit better in a separate OVA. What makes it less of criticism is that it is done very well in delving into the psyche of Emiya and shows how different he has changed throughout his life. So in retrospective, my reactions to Fate Zero’s attempt in constructing a narrative and character story are mixed, but they are far from terrible. 
 
People wanted to see the epic conclusion to Fate Zero, and they sure got it in good proficiency. Even though I felt the ending was a little anti-climatic to some degree, with some sequences feeling a bit rushed, they give at least some closure to the character arcs. Has this officially made me into a Fate series fan? No, not even close. But there are a lot of things to appreciate about Fate Zero and its attention for spectacle over substance. Sometimes that can work, and Fate Zero rests on that throne as one of the more enjoyable experiences. Now does this mean that Type-Moon will not stop milking their franchise and driving it into the ground in the future? You bet your ass they will. 
 
Grade: B

    Basically, scooby doo, but more predictable and japanese. Well, that's the original anime for you, the ""sub version"" of this anime is like a strong 4 at best. The dub on the other hand? A masterpiece 
 
Imagine an abridged series going legit. Well, this anime is exactly that. 
(This is second hand information) Ghost stories was poorly received in japan, so when it was handed over for redub for the west, they basically had 2 requirements. Don't change names and keep the ways the ghosts are defeated. 
AND THEY WENT HAM ON IT. Event though i have no idea if that is actually true, i wouldn't be surprised if it was. 
 
This might just by one of the 3 perfect comedy anime, along with cromartie highschool and nichijou. 
 
The story? There is a book with info on how to get rid of ghosts, kids fuck things up, as they do, and release some. The rest is monster of the week type of show. 
 
The characters? There is a big ""main"" cast but i would consider Hajime and Satsuki the main characters. They get a funny line every now and then in the eng dub. Where the comedy happens is the other characters and their interactions. You got a girl obsessed with christianity, a jew, a talking sarcastic cat and an actually retarded (potentially adopted) little kid. Let the madness ensue. 
 
Visuals? It looks exactly like any other middle of the road 2000s show. But hey at least it's not CG! 
 
The comedy? It all comes from the voice acting and rewritten lines....such as. 
""Bobby please forgive me for bringing you back to life, I know now that it could never work between us, as much as we want it to. Not because you're a rabbit, but because you're black"" 
 
Enjoyement, the only score that actually matters? ALL OF IT. 
Now, when you start up the show it won't be all that funny. At first it's like they care about the show and try to keep it normal, fast forward 7 episodes and you have a them making dumb noises just to match the lips.

    This is I think the the only review about Zetsuen no tempest which will explain why this anime is overrated and not underrated as a lot of people are calling it. Before I start I want to say that this is only my opinion. I don't want (and I'll try not to) insult anyone else's opinion. 
  
First of all I want to state that I love theater. I love watching theater and I love even more to act.  So wen I heard that this was influenced by Shakespeare's plays ''The Tempest'' and ''Hamlet'' I was more than excited to see it. And  indeed the story seemed really interesting. In fact Zetsuen no Tempest has a really unique and interesting plot full of plot twists from the start until the end. But there was a point where it lacked. ZnT  could not get away from the shounen label. That way a really interesting storyline  which could be made into an amazing seinen was held back by silly comedy relief as well as a really pointless second part. Especially with the latter I had a big problem because after a strong first part which had some really huge plot twists that were making you want to see the next episode instantly we went to a romance-driven second half that was a huge obstacle for the story development. 
The thing that I loved in this anime was certainly the art but to tell the truth this was not something unexpected. When was the last that Bones disappointed in terms of animation? 
Let's move to the sound section. The openings were horrible and the endings uninteresting. On the other hand the background music was really good and the voice actors do a fair job, everyone corresponding right in their roles. 
And now it's time for the characters of this anime. Due to the shounenish elements that I spoke before the characters themselves could not get away from the unavoidable cliches.We had the ambitious Mahiro and the genius Yoshino as the protagonists as well as the yandere Hakaze and a bunch of other cliche and unoriginal characters. I found Mahiro and Yoshino really exaggerated as characters. Especially Mahiro was annoying and unreasonable in most of the anime. Another huge disappointment was Samon's character. This guy turned from an interesting villain to ridiculous comedy relief!!! And just don't make me talk about Aika. Generally speaking almost all characters were really uninteresting. The only thing that saved them somehow was the kinda fair development the main characters had near the ending. 
While and before I watch this anime I was hearing people saying how underrated this anime was.  That had made me put my hopes really high and I ended up really disappointed. Zetsuen no Tempest has a really interesting concept  but very uninteresting story progression and characters which hold it back from being a masterpiece. But i believe that I was the only one seeing it this way. Everybody else loved it so I would  recommend you to watch this anime and make your own opinion.

    Every once in a while, there is a show that reminds you why you love the medium in the first place. May it be through the narrative completely enthralling you, the story resonating with personal events or just because it strikes a chord and makes you emotionally invested in what is going to happen. Kyousougiga is that show, and to me it is something that you can only really find in this medium. 
 
One of the first things to notice about Kyousougiga is that this is not the first Kyousougiga anime. The original was released in 2011 and was a 1 episode long ONA produced by Toei Animation and then followed up in 2012 with a 5 episode long OVA series made up of 10 minute long, seemingly unconnected character profiles. So, do you need to watch these two previous shows to watch Kyousougiga (TV)? Not at all, everything from the previous two shows is repeated and expanded upon in here with episode 0 being a straight up remake of the ONA and episodes 2-6 covering what were the OVA’s but in more detail. This however does not mean it is a straight up continuation, a lot of themes and story elements are changed entirely and is in all around different experience in the second half. This also means that fans of the original ONA and OVA’s may be disappointed in the drastic changes made, especially due to it being more exposition driven than the previous iterations but for the most part it carries off this new direction well. 
 
The story is relatively simple yet undeniably complex at the same time, with a narrative that fluctuates between linear and non-linear story telling it essentially creates a jigsaw like plot that slowly evolves as the storyline progresses and the true nature of certain individuals and events come into perspective. What starts off with what is essentially an anime interpretation of the classic Lewis Caroll novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland quickly becomes something else entirely, because at the heart of it, Kyousougiga is a story about family and self-discovery yet at the same time so much more. This show borrows heavily from Buddhist ideology, the Choujuu-giga, the Buddhist tale of Hariti/Kishimojin, the history of Kyoto and is also very reminiscent of classic anime such as FLCL, Paprika and The Tatami Galaxy in its presentation and narrative. All of this make Kyousougiga a show that is surprisingly more complex than it appears at face value yet is completely enjoyable to someone who does not want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. 
 
The show does suffer in the second half due to its low budget as there are many scenes which rely heavily on exposition. This unfortunately makes the second half of the show very divisive but all the themes that were in the first half are still there and the story takes the utmost logical route possible for what it is. This however is still Kyousougiga’s weakest element but I feel all of things great about Kyousougiga more than make up for it. And no need to worry, the ending is also excellent and ties up all the messages and themes nicely while returning to the quality of the earlier episodes. 
  
One major advantage that Kyousougiga has over other stories which deal with a character “going through the looking glass” is that the characters here feel like actual people with realistic motivations and characteristics and are not just an embodiment of the world in itself for the most part. A large aspect of the story just thrives on pure character development for the Council of Three which the story completely revolves around for the majority of the story and by the time that the true plot kicks in circa-episode 6 you do feel invested in these. That being said, there are a number of side characters that could have been implemented better, mainly for those that make up the entourage of Kurama and Yase such as Shoko and Fushimi and Myoue/Yakushimaru’s girlfriend who just seems to exist for some reason or another but for a 10 episode series it is done well enough for the majority of characters still to be memorable. 
 
One of the major factors that gathered my interest in this show is art style. Needless to say it is excellent with a lot of focus on colour and lighting which really support the sporadic tone of the show. There is a lot of subtlety in the art itself such as Mirror Kyoto being a lot more vibrant and colourful than its real world counterpart which focuses on shading and almost washed out colours to contrast with the unique character designs. There is also an undying playfulness about the art as there are many scenes where the artists incorporate watercolour like elements to make them stand out or put emphasis on the backgrounds while never being in your face about these elements like a show such as FLCL would. The use of lighting and shadowing in this show is fantastic which really bring to the forefront the amount of detail that the artists put into every scene, and there is a lot of detail. That is what I personally think the show excels in, no nook or cranny is underutilised and every scene is filled with trippy, psychedelic visuals all the way through to ultra-realistic and complex structures and backgrounds. 
  
However the same cannot be said about the animation at parts. Don’t get me wrong when it is good it is some of the best, but when it is bad it is very reminiscent of the infamous elevator scene in Neon Genesis Evangelion. This is one certain scene where Koto is standing at a station, unblinking, while CGI shenanigans occur in the foreground as well as the soon to be infamous “walking exposition” scene in episode 9 due to budget constraints. Luckily these scenes are few and far between but they do pull you out of your emersion at crucial points in the story. However, the shows particle effects used and the animation put into the action orientated scenes more than make up for it as they are gorgeous, everything from snow to dust flickering in the light looks realistic and really well down and really transform a scene where there is very little character movement to something very dynamic. There is also a reliance on CGI, and usually I absolutely hate CGI but here it is done pretty tastefully here. The majority of the CGI consists of indescribable light structures and computer generated people that are used to fill up space in mirror Kyoto or hanging ornaments inside the Council of Three Chamber, other than that it was relatively unnoticeable and fit the show pretty well. 
 
Where this anime really shines is its soundtrack by Go Shiina. This may be the first time since Yoko Kanno’s work on Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex that a soundtrack has been completely diverse yet fits the tone and setting perfectly. The pieces of music used in the show range from minimalist and melancholic Piano sonata’s such as the track “Promises in the Snow” all the way through to the track “Shoko” which is a strange mixture of Metal, Hip-Hop, Classical and Electronica which comes together surprisingly well. However, the real meat of this soundtrack comes from the absolutely incredible symphonic pieces which are very reminiscent of Joe Hisaishi’s work on Princess Mononoke and capture the emotions and events shown on screen incredibly well. 
  
I wouldn’t usually talk about the opening theme of show, but damn, the track Koko by Tamurapan may be the one of best Anime OPs I have ever heard really, it captures the feeling of the show perfectly and is just is bloody good song all around. There is also the insert song “The Secret of My Life” which is not only a great track, but is used exceptionally well in the context of the show. 
 
To me Kyousougiga is a masterpiece as it is everything an excellent anime should be. However, its budget really holds it back from being perfect and that is where the flaws really appear so I cannot give this show a 10 from an objective stand point although I personally think it does deserve it on enjoyment alone. The show is full of heart and passion and I really feel that the people who worked on this really did make the best of the resources that they had and with a higher budget this show would be perfect to me. 
 
Pros: 
+ Absolutely beautiful art and soundtrack. 
+ Great characters and a unique story. 
+ Surprisingly deep and thought-provoking. 
 
Cons: 
- The narrative and animation is weaker in the second half at points. 
- Fans of the ONAs and OVA may be disappointed in the change of direction. 
- Some side characters could have had better development. 
 
9/10

    Curiosity. Whether you love it, hate it, or lack it, curiosity is an unavoidable human nature in all of us. Daily explorations and innovations are all often made due to someone's curiosity. Even the Internet was built upon someone's curiosity for a virtual universe. Honestly, Hyouka sparked my curiosity when Kyoto animation first decided to produce it. Because I've had many great experiences with the studio's previous works, Hyouka didn't seem it would be an outlier to this trend. 
 
But, looks can be deceiving.  
 
Hyouka, it appears, extinguished my curiosity just as easily as it had lit them. Hyouka played out as perhaps one of the most disappointing mystery shows I've ever seen. But I don't mean that it ended up so terrible for a Series as a whole. Rather, the first 12 episodes of Hyouka alone out-shadowed any potentials of newer mysteries that could've matched some of the galvanizing story lines it began with. 
 
The setting of Hyouka is also misleading in itself since it takes place in the typical high school era, where most students are just beginning to reach the realization of their own ambitions. In this seemingly normal, typical school setting, something about the atmosphere within Hyouka's artwork suddenly set an alarm off. Immediately after the first episode, we find out Hyouka's main focus: Mysteries! 
 
Hyouka circles around the Classics clubs, of all clubs, to unravel several obscure cases. Although the reason for solving them is at first unknown, Oreki, a man sloth who only wishes to live his life by conserving as much energy as possible, suddenly decides to solve these mysteries for his beloved high school classmate, Chitanda. Following Chitanda are Oreki's two middle school friends, Satoshi and Mayaka. These characters all play significant roles themselves, but I'll talk about that after some bits. For now, all you need to basically know is: Trivial mysteries around the school easily provoke Chitanda's curiosity, Oreki solves them, and Satoshi and Mayaka speculates the scenes as Oreki ends up solving the cases.  
 
Despite its oversimplified cheesiness, Hyouka's mysteries provide a great sense of suspense that even a woman could enjoy. Each episodes utilize typical mystery novel devices such as cliffhangers and over dramatic scenes. However, they are all placed in concise places which constantly makes you rethink thoughts as new informations are being presented. What if the evidence is faked? Isn't she lying? What if there's another person involved? Perhaps, it wasn't intended to be pranks but rather.. a message? Each items worthy of mysteriousness  forced me to re-think each solutions of the mystery and essentially, each case gathered more and more details every single minute to the point that hypothesizing who the culprit is based on empirical observations became a rather naive thing to do.  
 
Actually, it's almost like describing a painting. First, imagine that there's a grass field drawn with bright vibes of warm colors. You would assume then, that the painting takes place in a peaceful, sunny location where the quietude could not be disturbed, right? What if then, a little girl holding balloons and a teddy bear is drawn in? Wouldn't that help re-assure the peacefulness within the illustration? Lastly, you look at the final piece drawn into the art: a man resembling that of your worst nightmare is hiding behind a random bush, armed, and seems to be hissing at the little girl. Well, doesn't that ruin the whole illustration. Ironically, Hyouka does something very similar to the process described above; at first an obvious answer is presented, glimpses of other alternatives are shown, and finally the different, appropriate route will be revealed. Hyouka keeps you guessing, and sharpens your analysis skills to an extent. Sometimes it gets to the point that watching Hyouka became less of an anime experience, and more of a scrappy puzzle. 
 
The musical aspects of Hyouka easily over-sieges many other productions with its greatly effective soundtracks. Whether it's the befitting contribution to the suspenseful atmosphere mentioned or stand alone chilling music, Hyouka accomplished them all. Some over repetitive soundtracks also created a sense of security as each episodes begun, but soon transitioned into snaky, backstabbing orchestra music as soon as mysteries were being solved. The two OP's and ED's are deemed to be rather classic J-pop styled music, but the animation took the initiative to even step up its creativeness a notch. 
 
Speaking of which, I'm sure most viewers of Hyouka could at least agree that the animation in Hyouka is spectacular. Shadow drops on figures and faces masking their identity were really effectively done to provoke a sense of danger, and many productions of artistic productions often generated spontaneous amounts of emotions. Lots of scenes referring back to an older scene or flashbacks gave off the just right balance between romanticism and realism. It was truly amazing that Hyouka expressed the exact emotion it intended to gave off with the mixture of Kyoto animation and original OSTs. 
 
""He has no ambition and no energy. He will not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again [Sherlock] has taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one."" 
 
The prior quote described Oreki Houtarou, otherwise Hyouka's main protagonist, perfectly. 
 
As a mystery Series, it's only natural for Hyouka to make references to the famous Sherlock Holmes novels. But instead of Sherlock, arguably, Oreki follows the path of Mycroft Holmes (Sherlock's older cousin) more accurately. Similar to Mycroft, Oreki starts out as someone who seems to be wasting his potentials. Oreki solves logical problems easily and applies appropriate solutions to most problems; but there's a major issue, Oreki is a sloth. By that, I mean Oreki doesn't like to waste time on anything trivial and rarely goes out of his way to do any outside activities. He's a smart guy who doesn't use his talents, and bored me with a rather dull personality as the series began. 
 
However, once a cheerful, sparkly-eyed girl named Chitanda Eru intervened in the daily life of Oreki sloth, everything changes. Instead of being selfish, Oreki started reconsidering what he deemed as arbitrary  matters around him and developed into a character who later inspected situations and cared for the resultant. The teasing relationship between Chitanda and Oreki is also one to be envied, as it gives a sense of hope that maybe even turtles can stand up for itself if given the circumstances.  
 
In fact, someone could describe Chitanda as the ocean to Oreki's turtle-headed mindset.  
 
Although, from even the first episode there's an evident amount of flirting & blushing between the two which suggests that the relationship between Oreki and Chitanda roots itself as a fatuous, romantic one more than anything else. Chitanda herself serves as an interesting comedy release, who gets intrigued by almost anything, in the quadruplet of the classics group. Chitanda has a pair of the most mesmerizing eyes in the world, and oftenly, she doesn't even realize her own curiosity being so infectious and transmissive through those hypnotizer-eyes. Chitanda even attempts to learn the art of seduction from a Senpai and though she doesn't successfully master it, we learn from a direct statement that Chitanda has her own charming, attractive qualities as a woman. Even so, Chitanda sometimes makes rather silly mistakes and it's within those memorable klutz performances that we realize Hyouka has a rather Slice of Life/Comedy side which can be as entrancing as its mystery aspects. 
 
Besides the main duet, there were also other noteworthy characters. Hyouka specifically assigned most other (side) characters to a role which would either occur once or as a reoccurring pattern throughout the Series. Most substantially, Oreki's two elementary friend who joined the same high school as him, Satoshi and Mayaka's more dramatized relationship, played a nice contrast in addition to Oreki & Chitanda's more flirty one.  Like many people, Satoshi is one who conforms with society but hides the secretive parts of himself, and as Hyouka progresses we learn more of him and Mayaka's past. As a female, Mayaka suppresses many of her feelings as well and only late in the series we find more than just what seems like her tsundere character. Otherwise, while solving mysteries, Satoshi and Mayaka both collect information for Oreki to solve and for Chitanda to be intrigued by. They also contributed to the unique storytelling technique Hyouka came up with, and became characters I absolutely respected even with their at times shady personalities. 
 
Even with all these great remarks, I felt that Hyouka could've improved on some aspects. 
 
What originated with Hyouka's initial premise came with a problem. Most characters in Hyouka are put in too perfect of situations and they are all given the most convenient excuses to somehow miraculously find and solve mysteries for themselves. Oreki, for example, got shoved into many crime cases by his sister and since her character was never really elaborated on, it seems as if his sister's whole existence was nothing more than an excuse to push plot lines across. Instead of saving the best elements for last, Hyouka also did the exact opposite. In the beginning of Hyouka, I barely recognized that Hyouka's mysteries were so realistic yet negligible. Only later did I find some of the writing to be unconventional and inconvenient in comparison to how over-dramatic some scenes were meant to play out. If Hyouka decided to suppress romanticism over realism, they could've at least attempted to make some of the mysteries sound more exciting. Instead, the producers decided to give Hyouka a rather dry, deceiving outlook. 
 
All in all, Hyouka is like a cup of coffee. At first glance, one can only observe a pool of muddy, shady imageries. After the first sip, you began to taste the bitterness only realizing you forgot to add sugar. Once Kyoto animation is delicately mixed along with other sweet flavored ingredients can you finally taste the truly colorful quintessences of Hyouka Coffee. Of course, not everyone could grow accustomed to the taste. It certainly isn't everyone's cup of coffee. However, without a doubt, Hyouka truly prevails as a work displaying how nothing is as it seems.  
 
As a fan of Slice of Life, I thoroughly enjoyed both the comedy and secretive aspects of Hyouka. As a curious being, you may desire to watch Hyouka because it produces splendid animation, misleading riddles, and ambiguous relationships. But in the end, I promise Hyouka will not be the enigma you expected. In most cases, it turns out for the better.

    I had watched part of Pilot Candidate early in my discovery and immersion into being an anime fan and had fond memories of it, when a friend finally bought the whole series I eagerly borrowed it so I could get the full story. Unfortunately the full story is not what this show provides, and my memories were rosier than reality. 
 
The show has some really nice art, though suffers some  from the early CG and anime mixing where the CG is very obvious. Character designs are overall very attractive and in my opinion one of the highlights of the show. It's all down hill from there though. 
 
What little plot can be found is convoluted and left utterly unresolved. Characters show know development or growth and for the most part invoke no empathy. The older pilots especially are little more than colorful but blank ""we must fight"" shells. The entire first disc (3 episodes) could be completely disregarded. I feel episode 4 gives us a better introduction to the characters and it had been the first episode I saw originally and I thought it was the first episode for the series. 
 
Music is decent, nothing special. The English voice cast is usually good, Zero and Kizna's particularly, but even the dubbing suffers in this show. The first disc has horrible lip sync and there are some episodes where the acting just falls short. 
 
Overall, the only saving factors are the clean animation and enjoyable character designs. The rest is a waste of time.

    Here we go, about the story. I think the story was good and a little bit sad. I don't care about satan's past that's nonsense I hate rin's mother too.  
 
Sound, perfect the character themes suited very well. I really like it plus the background music makes the fight enjoyable. I can say that they really put effort  on this anime 
 
Character, fair because they don't put much effort in this, weak will stay weak. Remember Bon about how will he kick satan's as but he's good for nothing he's weak and does not understand what's really happening. And Konekomaru, he is a coward bald. I really hate him how he reject rin and his baldiness. 
 
 
Enjoyment, Good .. I'll say no more, But overall it's Great

    Overall - 4: 
I felt like this anime was very inconsistent. The tones shift so drastically from scene to scene or even clash within the same scene. Overall to me this anime was a bad experience with some amazing parts. There were some seriously good things about this anime, but I felt like it had more holding it back than pushing it forward. 
 
Story - 3: 
The story was all over the place, pretty poorly explained (until the end where they literally just directly said everything). The way they handled this was terrible. A bunch of fake leads going to dead ends only to have the entire thing be explained in the end. It felt unsatisfying to say the least, and even though some of the plot was foreseeable, that didn't make it good by any means. The plot did set up for some powerful scenes and commentary on humanity, but it could have tried to be a lot more coherent. 
 
Art - 4: 
I personally think a unique art style is inherently better, and in some scenes the art style works, but in others I feel like it detracts from the rest of the show. There were times during fight scenes that I really had no idea what was going on because the way they framed the action was so poor and had so many cuts it was hard to keep up with. 
 
Sound - 6: 
Most of the soundtrack isn't that good, but there were a couple good songs that the frequently used well. 
 
Character - 6: 
There were characters in this I truly loved and felt like they were written incredibly well, this was most of the characters if I'm being honest, but there were some major things holding back a better rating here. 
 
The first is that the villains in this are evil for evil's sake, which isn't interesting at all. The story didn't handled itself well enough for this to be excused (in the sense that a well written story that used pure evil to say something may be excused for doing so). 
 
Another thing holding back some of the characters from being better is the sudden drastic changes they go through. For example when Akira becomes devilman his appearance (in his human form) changes so drastically he is almost unrecognizable from his former self, and in addition to that he acts completely differently. This essentially kills the Akira we knew for the first 15 minutes of the show, and yet only a handful of characters are very skeptical about the amount of change he went through in one night (and the people who are the most skeptical aren't even the people who know him the best).  
 
Many of the characters in this show act very realistically and the human struggles some of them go through are very compelling. Most of my favorite scenes are distant from all of the fantasy in the show and are just focused on the characters doing human things. 
 
Ryou. Throughout the series I went from dispising his character to disliking it, and this was all based on how the show was portraying him and how the other characters were reacting to his actions. It was beyond frustrating to see him mass murder people in the first episode and have Akira be more or less ok with it. It completely undermined some of the show's later conflict. Overall his motivations were weak, and everyone else was stupid for not seeing how bat-shit crazy he was. 
 
Enjoyment - 4: 
 
I hate gore. There were scenes in this that were just brutal and the only thing that made them watchable was the artstyle, and even then it was hard to look at. There seemed to be at least one of these scenes in every episode, and this certainly made me like the anime a lot less. Aside from that I disliked the plot and was frustrated by some of the choices the characters and writers made. The thing this show had going for it was simple: Scenes so out there they couldn't be anything but funny, Some really compelling character moments (like the rap/poem scene), and some very odd moments of fanservice.

    The anime has so much potential but it felt that watching this series had too much filler and didn't get to the main point. The theme of this anime is action : Action, Military, School yet this anime is much more focus on comedy. 
 
When compared to ""war theme"" anime such as Girls Und Panzer, it has a better balanced of action to comedy. Therefore, Haifuri has such dissapointment despite the fact it had its potential. 
 
Considering the fact that you can't afford to mess around with only 12 episodes, you have to get straight to the point. The equator event arc was not needed for the anime version as it serve as a filler like previously mentioned.

    Many people may find this anime to be a bit slow-paced at first, but if you are able to soldier through the first episode or two you will not be disappointed, the spiritual successor to Baccano, you'll find the story is told in almost the same style. Most of the characters are amazing, and, except for a few exceptions, you'll find yourself immersed in their lives. An amazing anime that shows there is more to someone than what meets the eye.

Curious as to why? well... you will have to stay tuned next week--just kidding! 
 
Alas, life is worth living people say. Is that true always? i have heard good arguments for both situations. Well, the creator of this anime provides an answer and not only that provides an additional one. His or her line of thinking is that no matter how strong you are to be strong you must be weak at some point. If one has ever been negatively impacted strongly before it can take a while to recover emotionally even then it still won't go all away. cue in the charger girls. Rising to the feat is their job to speed your path into possible greatness. Sure, by law they boost you but it takes a human to find a flaw. Which causes an unexpected greater benefit. What is that flaw? you will have to find out i am not telling :(P.  
 
What i will say is the idea of hidden aliens aiding us in our time of need might be actually true. Ever do a 160 out of nowhere mood wise? ever hear an inner-log voice relay a message that you immediately grasped that upon further review you might not have personally thought if forced too? 
 
I could tickle your fancy but i think you would strongly prefer i let the cute girls do it for you. Alas, i do have one regret i must say. I find my self lost in logical track of mind every time i think back to the joys this anime brought me. This is how i know it was good. Where even though the story has ended i can still see it playing.

    How to Overlord in 4 steps: 
 
1) Introduce random characters 
 
2) Give them a little backstory and make them take a lot of screen time 
 
3) Kill them ""for the benefit of Nazarick"" or enslave them ""for the benefit of Nazarick"" 
 
4) Repeat 
 
We've already seen this format since S2. Do you remember the lizardmen? The giant Hamster? Tuare? Maybe, probably not though. Not even their names. 
 
They took up so much screen time and then become unimportant, it's not interesting anymore. 
 
Unfortunately, S3 follows the same path, and only a handful of episodes are actually progressing the story, while 80% of the anime is ""fillers"" 
 
I've been told many times that it's for ""World Building"" but one does not come at the cost of another. See One Piece, and Made in Abyss to some extent. Both have worldbuilding that comes along with an actual story.  
 
We still don't know anything about the ""other players"" that might've been Isekai'd as well, and Ainz is the same geek who plays like a lord. And ofc everyone wants his D. 
 
There are no more cool adventures of Adventurer Momonga like in S1, it's just ""Let's slaughter people because it 'Benefits Nazarick'"" now. 
 
Combine it with horrible CGI and here you go, a recipe for disaster. 
 
One more thing, imagine the titans in AoT. They're scary, right? 
 
Now make them in horrible CGI. Not so scary, are they? 
 
And now for the cherry on top, make the exact same goat voice line play every few seconds. Yes, a GOAT voice line. 
 
Wat 
 
 
At least OP and ED were good.

    Tokyo Ghoul is a anime about a human who becomes a ghoul. I found at the start that the anime kind of wasn't my thing, but as it continued it reached my second favorite anime behind Akame Ga Kill. This anime has an amazing story, and doesn't just show the Ghoul side, but also the human side. I love how even though the main character is a monster he still has his morale. Overall I think any anime fan, or just people wanting a good story should check this out. Can't wait for season 2

    Before I go on to only say negative things about this show, I'd like to say that underneath my criticisms is a show that is wonderfully unique with a very interesting story and well developed, uniquely interesting characters. 
 
Now I'm just gonna talk about the things I didn't like about it. 
 
This show is confusing; this show is very confusing. If you told me that you understood all or even most of this show's critical plot points on your first watch I would call you a liar. Critical bits of plot are mixed into dialogue in a show that is all about dialogue, some of this dialogue is nonsensical without a background in strangely specific topics, such as Jewish mysticism. How are you supposed to determine what is important to the plot and what is intellectual nonsense? I don't know watch it again I guess. 
 
Or watch an ""Evangelion Explained"" video which is probably what most of the people watching the show did. On your first watch, you probably don't know what the EVA units even are. If you did I applaud you but there are so many other questions that are answered in confusing ways often outside of chronological order that I'm not even going to bother listing any of them because I could actually be here all night.  
 
What do I think about 26 episode shows where rewatching them at least once (probably more to the tune of 3 times) is required to have even a basic understanding of the plot? I think that you're doing your audience a disservice and either didn't try or actively tried to make your show confusing. I don't think a show being confusing is a positive, I think it is a negative, it means that you didn't explain things well enough to be picked up even by perceptive viewers. If you love shows like this though, and consider rewatching a show multiple times to be an enjoyable part of 'puzzle solving' then you will love Evangelion. 
 
If you're like me though, and don't typically rewatch shows, especially not immediately after your first watch, then you will be very confused and have lots of questions, and you will probably have to watch an ""Evangelion Explained"" video on Youtube. If that's something you actively want to do then you'll probably like Evangelion, I don't mind being confused and I enjoy having somebody put the pieces together for me afterwards because it's satisfying, which is why I give Evangelion an 8/10/. I don't however, like this more than being able to watch the puzzles fall into place myself, which is why I don't give this show a 10/10. I think it's kind of lazy of a show to rely on your viewers to make videos explaining the show for you because the show doesn't do a good enough job on its own, and has an allergy to answering more questions than it asks, even when the show is already packed to the brim with questions.  
 
There are 2 big flaws with this kind of writing. The first flaw is that big reveals and important story moments might fall flat on some viewers, but be loved by others, because what each viewer understands on their first watch will be different, and thus the writers can't rely on viewers knowing certain things and can't really reveal anything big without risking ruining important moments. The show attempts to avoid this by never really having these types of reveals; this makes the show even more confusing but at least there aren't huge thrilling moments that are ruined because I didn't catch that the previously revealed Adam is actually subtly re-revealed as Lilith all along. That's right, one of the show's big reveals is actually a red-herring all along and the actual reveal is another strange dialogue moment which is easily missed. Even the few and far between moments where Evangelion decides to answer a question, they lie to you, because the show wasn't difficult enough to follow already.  
 
The second flaw with this kind of writing is that the writer has no control over the quality of the ""Evangelion Explained"" videos that are made, and what content the viewer watches after they finish watching the show. Much of your enjoyment of the show might come from how good the explained video you watch is, or how well put together the wiki is, or what links you click on in what order, etc... 
 
My final small gripe with the show has nothing to do with it being confusing, however. The first 5 episodes were very very boring and difficult to watch for me. After this, the show becomes enjoyable until the final 2 episodes which I'm well aware aren't even exactly canon. You can skip these last two episodes and watch the movie instead. The movie is great, except it is also very confusing. It starts off strong by answering some questions and baits you into a false sense that the movie might actually just tie up all of the perceived loose ends (most of which are just things you missed, not actual loose ends, but there still are plenty of loose ends). This is not the case, however, because the show ends in one of the trippiest confusing sequences in the history of anime so hopefully, you enjoy watching another explained video for the movie as well because you'll need it.  
 
TL;DR This show is confusing on purpose, it ties in crucial plot points in dialogue along with pointless references to religion, biology, etc, most of which you will probably mistake as crucial plot points, some of which are important but literally cannot be deciphered without extensive background knowledge in fringe subjects. It starts off boring as well. Other than that the story is actually very interesting and the characters are very unique, if the show did a better job of making the show digestible on your first viewing then it could have been a 10/10 for me. Unfortunately, you WILL have to watch an explainer video or rewatch the show multiple times to understand it. It's worth the watch despite these flaws though, in my opinion, unless you don't like being confused from beginning to end with very few ""aha!"" moments, in which case don't watch this show.

    This entire review can be wrapped up in a single sentence. Beautiful animation but a poorly executed story. The premis of the show is great, the charachters sharing pain and emotion seems interesting enough,however, if that is the premise then the show obviously needs to be a charachter based show which is the major flaw here. 
 
A show like this only makes an impact if the charachters can make you connect to them and care about them. I personally had a hard time connecting with the charachters mostly because they were not like able. Also there is a prominent lack of back story for any charachter that you might actually like. 
 
Aside from the charachters the plot is kind of all over the place with pacing issues included free of charge! There are also times when the plot gets a little hard to follow but that may have just been me. As for the rest of the show... 
 
The animation is great Bright and colorful and really catches your eye. Im not really knowledgeable about animation quality and specs but i do know that this is pretty good animation. The charachter designs are all unique and stand out alot. And i personally enjoyed the op so much that i watched it every time. 
 
Overall id say kiznaiver was fair to mediocre. If you are looking for charachters you can really sink your teeth into then this is not your show. But if you just want some shallow high school drama with colorful charachters, great art and animation then kiznaiver is what you are looking for.

    I'm impressed with this hentai. It's very fun, romantic, and hilarious at the same time. The story is alright at its best, it deserves to have a nice, hentai-related plot. The animation looks fantastic as it is, in 2004 standards. The sounds are great as well. The characters really have effort of having depth in themselves and each has strong character development. The sex scenes and the non-sex scenes are the best part of the this hentai. Nothing to complain about it, but it can be imperfect. Still it's a very decent hentai that everyone loves to watch. In Summary, I do recommend this anime to anyone that likes hentai and the girls part of fanservice.

    -----Personal Opinion------- (spoilers) 
 
I went to this show completely blind, I did not know anything about it beside it's title. At first glance I already knew that this wasn't going to be a heartwarming children adventure anime, it was a mere hunch that told me so. I was correct but I did not expect it to be this dark and twisted, and because of that Made In Abyss became my favorite anime of all time. 
 
Story 10/10 
A story involving children adventuring through the mysterious and cruel abyss, the story honestly couldn't get any better. When the episode showed the full picture of the abyss, I just couldn't say anything but ""wow"". That single view alone told me so much about the story just by looking at it and it's honestly an experience I wish to experience again for the first time.  
 
Our two protagonists, Riko and Reg began meeting the first time on an accidental encounter inside the first layer of the abyss, they became the best of friends after some time and decided to venture into abyss with each of them looking to accomplish their separate goals while protecting each other along the way. Already, this anime displays the dire need of survival brilliantly, as the abyss is the most merciless entity in the anime, large creatures dominating every layer, while humanity remain next to powerless once they're inside, this creates a visible stake, a stake that is inevitable for our protagonists to avoid. Riko getting poisoned and barely hanging by a thread was a very powerful event in the anime, it shows how weak and powerless our protagonists are in the grand scheme of things, Reg despite doing everything that he can still could not do a thing to save Riko, and that's where Nanachi, a great fucking character came in to save the day, nanachi opened another path to the story, a very dark path if I do say so myself. Mitty and Bondrewd were characters introduced upon opening that path, with each serving a different purpose than the other. Bondrewd being a cruel and a psycho (not sure how to accurately describe his traits), who won't stop until he gets what he wants is an amazing addition to the story, showcases that it's not just the abyss thats the challenge for our MC's. Finally Mitty's backstory and death just broke my heart to pieces, it's the first scene to make me cry on a 13 episodes Anime. 
 
Art 10/10 
Not much to say, just the first episode alone was enough to convince me that everyone on the production company was very passionate about the project. Everything about the art style was just pleasing to watch, it fits the Anime on every aspects. 
 
Sound 10/10 
Glorious, the music accompanying each scenes were perfect, with my favorite being the scene where the sun rises and shines upon Orth, the music selection could not be more perfect. 
 
Characters 8/10 
The characters are great but they lack signatures, I can't say it's 10/10 because, after a while, the characters in this anime probably won't stick around in your mind like for example Edward Elric from FMAB and Killua from HxH do. 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
Finished the entire thing within 6 hours, that's probably a good way to potray my enjoyment towards it. 
 
Overall 10/10, I wish that this anime would get a sequel in the form of a TV series rather than a movie, because I don't think a 2 hours movie would fit the next upcoming arc of the manga completely, still though, id be watching it as I'm a big fan of this series.

    episodes are random, yet portray a good overall character development. i loved how each character interacted with each other, and grew together.  
 
vamp is kindhearted, but a little out of touch as a person o his age usually is. he makes the perfect housewife. sunred on the other hand is a brute on the outside, but a super big softie on the inside who cannot always portray his feelings and emotions correctly.  
 
while the story is rather lacking, it makes up for it with its very fitting art style and catchy theme song. overall, the this anime is very enjoyable.

    Stranger: Mukou Hadan Review 
 
Story (9/10) Great 
 
The story was great, easy to understand and follow stays consistent. Nothing really much to say about it. Could it have been deeper? yeah but was it necessary? no not everything needs to blow my mind (if it did it would have gotten a 10 but there's only so much you can do in a movie so there's that) I feel the movie as a samurai movie first and everything else second accomplished what it went to do. 
 
Art and Animation (10/10) Masterpiece  
 
The art style was amazing and there isn't a section to talk about animation in this but it has to be mentioned. Yes it's a movie and art style and animation in most movies are amazing anyway but I have to praise not only the art style and animation but the fighting choreography is probably would stood out the most to me i'll talk more about that in the enjoyment section. 
 
Sound (10/10) Outstanding 
 
The sound effects, character voice actors (dub), authentic music where all on point nothing off here either perfect. 
 
Character (9/10) Great   
 
The characters are great the only reason it's not a 10 is because obviously we don't have enough time to get in depth with the characters like Nanashi I would have love to know more about his past instead of little quick second flash backs same goes for Luo-Lang. But as far as what we know about the characters it's definitely a 9 to me. The only character that got on my nerves a bit was Kotarou he was kind of annoying but it wasn't enough to drop it by any points. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10) Outstanding 
 
My enjoyment was definitely at it's peak during the fighting like I said before this is some of the best samurai battle choreography I've ever seen in animation format. I hope it Vagabond ever got an anime they get someone as good as Studio Bones to do it because they probably adapted this series to the point were it's better than it's manga.  
 
Overall (9/10) Great  
More Specifically (9.60/10) Great+ 
  
I'm not really a fan of anime movies but this one is definitely a gem among gems anything Samurai relate that's going into anime format needs to get inspiration from this right here Sword of the Stranger is a really great anime movie and I should have watched this shit a long time ago.

    High School DxD is the second to the best Ecchi-Harem anime I've watched. Even though it involves devils, it seems that the main characters which are devils are not bad at all and the male protagonist fits his role as a devil for being such a pervert. And oh, (my bad if this seems to be a spoiler, but) who would have thought that angels, devils and fallen angels would make a peace agreement in the end, and the devils who are formerly God believers would be allowed to pray... And it seems to be quite fun to be reborn as a demon with such power....

    Honestly Gurren Lagann takes you from being a boy to a man. It honestly has Homer/Illiad levels of writing, development and progression. This is what Darling in the Franxx tried to be but didn’t reach. This is the pinnacle of not only anime, but storytelling in general. The fact that it has 8.74 instead of 9 on MAL is blasphemous. This is a masterpiece in the most literal sense of the word.  
 
This is truly the story of a boy who becomes a man. Simon is not just a standard Shonen MC. He is all of us. We are quite literally watching ourselves grow more confident, stronger and wiser. I don't know what the hell I was doing in 07 to have missed this, probably watching Gundam, Big O or Discovery Channel, but this series is the pinnacle of not just anime, but literary writing in general.

    The story and dynamic between the characters keeps me interested, but there are some loopholes and slow progressions in the story that makes me not want to continue the series. For example, there was a couple of episodes in a row in the middle of the season that I felt could fit into a single episode. I'm not sure if there was a minimum number of episodes they needed to fill, but it definitely felt like it when I was watching the season. But if you want something to watch casually, this is great. Very interesting concept, and the potential for future seasons has a lot of potential for great character development.

    Its a masterpiece. I could go on for hours about how everything about is great. 
The characters, great. Yona is probably the best anime protag I've ever seen. Or at least for women. She's strong, but she puts in an effort, you see her struggling and its amazing. I've read the manga and it just gets better. The story is great, its not like a huge save the universe story, but its nice to have a small scale story. It's about a princess who is saving her homeland. It also isn't unrealistic, Yona isn't the strongest, but it makes sense. Now every female has to be a bad ass to be a strong female character. But its because Yona struggles that makes her more human. It makes her such a powerful character that more women can relate too

    Story (7/10) - Just by reading the synopsis, most people would already make a comparison of this anime to Sword Art Online. You wouldn't be wrong to do so, but that's about where the similarities end. Having to adapt to a new world is not easy, but it's made a little easier when your role is the maxed-out avatar you created. 
 
Art (8/10) - Very detailed; vivid colors for a beautiful world. 
 
Sound (7/10) - Nice songs accompanied by nice visuals. 
 
Character (5/10) - There isn't much here. It's what you'd expect from having devoted NPC servants. Each has their own personalities... 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) - This was pretty good. I liked how the main character didn't overly react to suddenly being trapped, and his quick adjustment to accept the situation and try to roll with it. 
 
Overall (6.8/ 10) - Similar to SAO, but not the same. Somewhat confusing magic system, and overpowered-scenarios are thrown everywhere. Not a bad series, and I can't wait to see what's next.

    Beck is an anime that I have deep respect for since I am a musician myself. This show really does create a sense of what being a rock musician would really be about and it does have some great moments that make this show memorable. Add that to its good music, and spectacular voice acting and characters, Beck comes off as a fantastic show. However, Beck although very good in its ideas, expression, humor, characters, and just overall awesomeness as an anime also makes some aggravating blunders that bother me to no end. Without these blunders or issues, I feel that this anime could have been one of the greatest animes ever made. Although the positives do outweigh the negatives in the end, the negatives just stick in my head so much because they were surrounded by so much good.  Without further ado, let's get into my review Beck:Mongolian Chop Squad. 
Story -6/10 
	Beck’s story is quite an admirable and unique one. The story follows the events of the main protagonist Yukio Tanaka (Koyuki to his friends) as he moves on through his teenage life becoming a guitarist, singer and member of the band Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad. Through the episodes he learns to become a better musician from his band mates as well as from an older man, Mr. Saito. On the side he also does swimming, school, and jobs to help pay for his fees that he needs for the band’s albums and instruments. Over the time he goes through many conflicts, such a romantic issues, bullying, and personal feelings of being unworthy. This turns out to be overall a good, unique, and connectable story. The story has many good ideas as well as some interesting humor, dialogue, and plot twists that work very nicely. Overall it is a very enjoyable story. However, like I said before, there are issues that bother me and the story has a lot of big ones. One issue is the pacing of the events in the show. Although there are some great sections with good plot changes or good humor or meaningful dialogue, there aren’t always great sections in every episode of the series. There are plenty of moments that are just plain awesome, but these moments are always packed together into one or two episodes and then there would be about three or four episodes before anything meaningful happened again. This leaves a few strings of episodes that are boring compared to some of the other episodes. Another issue is how some conflicts between characters just disappear like magic sometimes without a resolution. Somehow these conflicts just end up pushed aside and not mentioned either ever again or not until quite a bit later which just feels really strange. This was quite annoying and confusing for me and it created a lot of questions about how they could just magically forget issues like they never even happened. It was just too unrealistic and unsatisfying, both of which are very bad to me. On the subject of unrealistic and unsatisfying, another issue is how many of the characters (especially the side characters) are just thrown out of the show for long lengths of time and sometimes permanently. A lot of the time they show reasons for these characters to leave but the show doesn’t execute this very well. During this they also add new characters almost in a way to replace the old characters which sometimes feels forced. Many times these characters also even come back just out of the blue without much of an explanation why only to leave again after spending part of one more episode on screen. This ends up creating a lot of questions and also a lack of resolution for issues with the side characters. Now there are plenty of situations where the show gets these situations and character interactions right, but the fact that they can’t get it all right when they already got some of them right doesn’t make sense to me. My last issue is simply with how the ending feels pretty rushed although satisfying overall story-wise. 
Art- 6 /10 
	This is one of the bigger blunders of the series and I feel like I’m honestly being generous for giving it a 6 and not a 5 or lower. I’m not entirely sure why and how it ended up like this either. The art style of the show although not my favorite is interesting so that isn’t necessarily the issue here. The animation done isn’t necessarily bad per say so that’s not the main issue either. I do admit that I have a problem with how the characters look while playing their instruments (in particular Saku the drummer) since they look so rigid and definitely not how real musicians would when playing. However, even with this issue, sometimes they do seem a little more accurate in how they should look and everything else including movements and facial expression and background movement etc, are well done. So then you must be asking, “What is it that you find so bad?” The answer to that question is not lack of style or bad execution, but rather lack of things to execute. Although the animation and style work just fine, there are plenty of things that are just not animated in general. There is so many times where expressions or conversations or events are just not shown from the characters view and instead non- moving pictures of scenery are just added during these scenes to act as a buffer zone. This issue applies very heavily to the ending of the show as the entire ending is essentially just stand still images with narration or small conversations and no animation which is honestly absolutely unacceptable.  Also, sometimes when characters are talking, the only thing that is moving is their mouth and nothing else creating very little expression of character through the animation. These issues sometimes aren’t as noticeable as in other episodes but when they are noticeable, they are VERY noticeable, and if you can’t catch them I would be very surprised. I don’t really know why the animations just aren’t great in this series and it is quite disappointing. If this was actually a stylistic choice then I highly disagree with that choice. My best guess is that they probably didn’t have enough funding to do a stellar job for the art. Why they didn’t have a big enough budget, I have no idea; all I know is that it’s a darn shame that they didn’t. 
Sound- 8/10 
	Yay now I get to talk about some of the better stuff. I will split up the sound category into two sections, one for voice acting and one for music. 
Voice Acting- 8.5/10 
	Strangely enough, Beck is the first series that I watched entirely with the English dubs. I honestly never watch anime with the English dubs for I believe subs are just so much better almost all the time. This was one situation that I actually watched the dubs because I enjoyed them more than the subs. There are a few reasons for this. The first reason is that the English dubs are actually quite fantastic. The English voice actors for the main characters are amazing especially for Ryusuke the lead guitar player, his sister Maho, and Chiba the singer. Taira the bassist and Saku the drummer are also consistently good throughout the show when it comes to voice acting. Honestly almost every single voice actor for the English dubs does a great job including most of the side characters as well. I thought the voice actor for Yukio Tanaka was a little weak at first but as the series went on I either got used to it or the actor got more comfortable with his role and started to perform better; either way is fine with me because by the end his voice fit the role of Koyuki very nicely. The second reason for watching the dubs is the amount of English that is actually already in the Japanese dubs. Because of the characters being fluent in English, the Japanese dubs have a lot of Japanese voiced English speech. Although the English speech in the Japanese dubs ends up being pretty good in general (for Japanese people that is), there are some issues with the accents and pronunciations that bother me in the Japanese dubs. I just simply asked myself, “If I’m going to be hearing English consistently either way how do I want to watch this show? Do I want it with good English voice actors with consistently good voice acting, or do I want Japanese voices that although cooler than English voice acting in general, aren’t the best when it comes to English speech. I chose the English dubs. Overall the voice acting for both sides is superb except for some early issues with the English dub and some of the English language issues for the Japanese dub. I personally recommend the English dubs but that might just be me. Do what you want. 
Music -7/10 
	Clearly, a show about a rock band has to have good music for it to get some credit. So the question is, “Is it good?” My answer: yes, it is good, very good actually. This is more of a personal thing since not everyone likes rock music particularly punk rock but since I do like rock I say yes, the music is good. I also find that the music they play is indeed good enough to be considered popular and good enough to get them to where they need to be so on that note not only is the music played by Beck good, but it is also realistic. The other bands in the show are also quite good and quite realistic in how they sound as well. I like how they show some of the differences in genres and it’s nice that they had someone knowledgeable enough about music to show that. It’s nice how they don’t only just play punk rock the whole show and delve into different types of rock as well as rap and blues. On the other hand, most of the time if not all the time there is only music being played during a concert or sometime when a band is playing or something of the sort. What does this end up doing? It creates scenes that are completely silent except for dialogue. It’s perfectly fine to have some scenes just have dialogue but when all the scenes that don’t have a band in it have no music it gets annoying. This is one of the issues I didn’t really notice until late but as soon as I noticed it I was quite outraged that they never bothered to have any other sound track music. On side notes, the singing is very good in both the English and Japanese dub (Personally feel it’s better in the English dub and the singing also applies to the voice actors performances) and the OP and ED of the show are good. 
Characters -8/10 
	The characters of this anime, especially the main ones, are a prime example of good characters. All the members of the band are especially likeable with good character traits and good virtues. Of all the main characters I would have to say my favorites are definitely Koyuki due to his nice and hard working attitude as well as the quite spectacular character development that he experiences throughout the show, Chiba who has an amazing attitude and is just a heck of a party, and last but not least my potentially number one favorite, Maho who is a beautiful, talented, kind, funny, and spunky teenage girl who is just so freaking awesome. The main characters are just absolutely fantastic and that’s why the characters score as high as it is. On the bad side there are some issues with the side characters. There are indeed some good side characters either because they are interesting or funny but most of them because of the strange pacing of the story just randomly disappear and aren’t mentioned ever again. This applies to one of the antagonists of the story which seems pretty messed up to me. Although some of the side characters aren’t great some of them are great like Mr. Saito for example and they just choose to get rid of them and replace them with other ones. This ends up making most of the side characters pointless by the end of the show and overall leading a feeling of disappointment. I also wish that they had chose to add some of the more relevant side characters like Yukio’s mother for example who is never really shown on screen at all. Other than these issues the characters are spectacular. 
 Personal Enjoyment -9/10 
	Although there were some annoying issues that bugged me a lot of the time I spent watching this show, I tried to not let them bother my enjoyment of the show. It was honestly because I enjoyed the show so much that I was bothered so much by the annoying issues that plagued much of Beck. Luckily for myself, I was able to keep the issues from ruining the whole show for me. Add my ability to ignore the bad with the oozing amounts of good dialogue, humor, romance, and plot twists, I ended up loving this show from start to finish and I just couldn’t stop watching it. It might not be the best show on a critical stand point, but it’s certainly a fun show to watch. 
Overall- 7.5/10 
	Beck is one of those shows that could have gone down in my book as one of the greatest animes every created. It had all that it needed to succeed and become a genuine masterpiece but it was plagued so much by a strangely paced and unrealistic story as well poor animation work and some pointless side characters. If these issues had been fixed or maybe just even one of them, this show could have been absolutely phenomenal. I do recommend watching the English dub version over the subbed version and I just want to say that this show was very hard to critique because of its uniqueness and close relationship to my personal life. This is good show that people should watch and I hope that many continue to watch over the course of its existence. I round down the score of 7.5 to 7 instead of 8 because I feel that the issues in the story and the art work are pretty big and I feel that it’s important to show that with a lower score. I give Beck a solid but disappointing 7.5 out of 10.

    When people say they don't like naruto shippuuden, its usually because of the amount of filler episodes. Some are good and others not so much but i don't judge an anime by the amount of fillers because its not their fault. Naruto's story was really good because it was complicated yet easy to understand and it kept you interested. Their were some plot holes but that was because shonen jump refused to run naruto unless kishimoto made it longer. The art quality was average and rarely bad but they made it beautiful when it was really necessary. The op's, ed's, and sound tracks were really well done and pretty. They stayed in your head and you could tell that it was from naruto shippuuden. Naruto Shippuuden is an anime with a lot of character personality and development. You know every characters past, personality, and even know what they will do next. Naruto Shippuuden was very enjoyable with a great balance of drama,comedy,sadness, and action scenes with a little hint of mystery to always keep you guessing. Overall I give it a 10/10 because of its enjoyment, characters, sound, and story and of the life lessons this anime gives.

    ·Story: 6/10 
 
The plot of this anime is similar to other anime's plots, but in this case it's focused on a police genre, which is the reason why I gave it a 6. 
 
The story isn't too original from what I've seen as many of the episodes are simple typical cases of the police genre but with that touch of fantasy that characterizes this anime. 
 
·Art: 3/10 
 
I won't be so severe in this part, but I have to say that the art of this anime is really poor. Fight scenes are cut, yes, in some scenes they are literally an static image.  
 
This is what reduces it's mark a lot, also normal scenes aren't the best quality they could be, for me they seem to have been made ''fast and with no energies?''.  
 
·Sound: 7/10 
 
The general sound is good, what made me put a 7 and not a 6 was it's opening, which reminds me of that typical old style.  
 
Also, music is pretty good, although there are some scenes that don't coordinate with the audio. 
 
·Character: 5/10 
 
The characters in my opinion aren't good enough. What I mean with this? 
 
As far as I have seen the personality of the characters hasn't been defined really well, I will change my mind if I see that this changes in the next episodes but by far I will keep my 5. 
 
·Enjoyment: 5/10 
 
The combination of the bad art with the ''typical'' plot and the bad sound sometimes really makes it's enjoyment really hard.  
 
I consider that with some changes would be much better, especially in the quality of the art in the fight scenes, which I consider the most important part of a police genre anime. 
 
·Overall: 5/10 
 
In general, is a mediocre anime. I hope it gets better with the time!  
 
Thank for reading! :D

    I would wait until the series is done before writing a review, but unless episode 15 is a complete bomb that ruins the whole the show, then my opinion probably isn't going to change. Bakemonogatari is one those special animes that come out maybe once every couple years. On the surface it appears as a generic harem show with a funky artstyle and tongue-in-cheek characters. But I would be selling it short if I said that was it,  Bakemonogatari at its core is a deconstruction/parody of the harem genre.  
 
Bakemonogatari's story is nothing special. The basic premise involves a boy named Koyomi Araragi coming across and solving people's problems or ""oddities"", which is to say supernatural anomalies. The plot is there simply to propel the characters around and move them from situation A to situation B. Though that's not necessarily a bad thing since storytelling isn't the focus of this anime. The narrative recognizes itself for what it is: exposition that that merely leads the characters along a path but never actually becomes a focal point. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're looking for a good plot, you definitely won't find one here. 
 
The focus of the show, and the main reason why anyone would watch it at are the characters. This is where the harem deconstruction sctick comes into play, all the characters are written as realistically as possible which is a stark contrast to most harem shows. Most of the time, the female characters fall madly in love with the male lead for stupid reasons, yet in Bakemonogatari, the relationships are written well and are feasible. Not to mention that there's a very tongue-in-cheek approach to all the archetypes that have become so common in anime. The female lead for example, Senjougahara is a self-proclaimed ""tsundere"" yet she displays not of the traits common in other characters of the same archetype. If anything, she comes across as more of a kuudere/yandere. Araragi also displays characteristics that aren't typical of a harem lead. Most are spineless self inserted Gary Stus that the entire cast loves for no apparent reason, while Araragi is a snarky anti-social punk that comes across as more of a shounen lead. Needless to say all of the characters are well written and its fun to see them interact with each other on screen.  
 
The dialogue is another main feature of the series. I've heard many people say that its intelligent and witty, but in my opinion its neither of those two. The dialogue is extremely fast paced so it might give off the impression of being witty when its actually just poking fun at itself. Many of the exchanges between characters tend to meander around aimlessly and have no real significance at all, but if anything that's a testament to how enjoyable the show is. If the majority of an episode can be filled with nothing but absurd dialogue and still manage to be extremely entertaining and funny then I'd say its doing its job incredibly well. 
 
The art has a very clean look to it, albeit a bit generic yet its extremely stylized. There's a lot of debate over the animation, but there a big difference between bad animation and not that much of it. All the actions that are animated are well done and smooth, characters generally move around while talking and don't make static facial expressions. The lip flaps also aren't just the open and close variety, characters do give off a decent impression that they're forming vowel sounds with their mouths instead of just the old open and close routine. The bottom line is that a show like Bakemonogatari doesn't really need animation, hence all the skepticism when it was being adapted. However Shaft did a good job to play to the show's strengths and all the stills/cuts are there to get the viewers to focus on the dialogue. Simply watching people talk would get boring but the frantic cuts and text screens keep the viewers on their toes and have them focus on the audio aspects when the visuals are far too haphazard to make sense off. All the style definitely works in favor of the show.  
 
The voice actors are all terrific, they do a splendid job in delivering the lines with the perfect amount of emotion or lack of in some contexts. The background music itself isn't too memorable, has a nice beat when everyone is rambling on and becomes dramatic during important scenes. The openings are all really catchy and well sung by the female cast. The ending in particular is probably one of the best I've seen/heard in general.  
 
Overall, I had lots of fun watching this anime. One important thing to realize is that its best to go in not having any expectations for this show. I had no idea what I was getting into when I first started watching and I'm glad I didn't. If I had to put a label on it, I'd say that it's tremendously quirky and its awesome for it, sorta like FLCL. It has a lot of charm, and if you take it for what it is, you'll enjoy it too.

    One of the good summer anime shows of 2011.  
 
The story is a bit dull but the drama makes up for it. But I did try to avoid the spoilers because it is interesting at some parts. I really loved some surprising plot twists. Like Yukiatsu's part. 
 
The art was brilliant when it came to the background and scenery. It was based off some real town in Japan. The characters were awkward sometimes. The character design was done by the person who did Toradora, I think, but this time, they made sure that people had strong jaw/chins. But some people looked fine. Like Yukiatsu. 
 
The cast was pretty cool, especially Yukiatsu's Sakurai Takahiro. 
 
The music was fabulous, OP, ED and BGM. The ending made me nostalgic because it was a cover of a song from 10 years or something which I heard often when I was living in Japan. 
 
Prepare some tissues/handkerchief for the last episode. 8'D

    Re-evaluated and edited: August 23rd 
 
First, I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of this series and I'm trying my best not to be biased. 
 
Story - 3/10 
 
Quite possibly the worst aspect, in my opinion, is the story. From the first episode, Mekakucity Actors (MCA) feels extremely rushed, the exposition thrown at the viewer may be hard to catch on the first viewing and , and nothing really happens until episode 9. I can imagine it can be really confusing to some viewers, and may choose to drop it rather quickly. However, on some forums that I frequent, I've seen that some viewers find joy in the mystery aspect of the anime's story. For individuals who have read the manga, novels/ watched the PVs you will most likely be very annoyed by the storyline. Many of the facts which were stated within the universe are broken, and there was some obvious retconning which occured to make the story less tragic. 
 
Art - 4/10 
 
When I heard SHAFT was doing the art for MCA, I was ecstatic. I thought the anime would have looked absolutely amazing. As shown by my score for the art, I was extremely disappointed. In many of the scenes that took place within a character's conversation or within the city, the backgrounds were simple, boring and really distracting. There was the odd scene where they showed some really good metaphorical art, and beautiful scenes, however these were mostly present during times when they played the original songs that Jin had written. However there was a scene where use of a 3D modelling system was used, most likely in a rushed attempt to finish it, or maybe because the artist thought it would be artistic, but either way it was was a bit weird as it felt really detached from the anime's art style. For all the bad however, there is some good; A lot of the times the Character Art was extremely well done, and was almost as good as Monogatari's character art, most of the time. 
 
Sound - 9/10 
 
As said before, I am a big fan of this series and as such I really enjoy the original songs which initially ignited the beginning of this story. I honestly have to say, I was blown away by the music. Instead of using a vocaloid to perform the song, they hired professional singers, and boy was it worth it. The singers breathed life into the songs which I thought I had heard many times before, and brought with it a different yet added feeling to the songs. I don't particularly remember any of the background music, but I guess that gives you an idea of any if it were there, isn't really notable, doesn't produce much feeling (which is why I dropped it down to 9). The extremely enjoyed the work of the voice actors and thought they performed their characters really well. 
 
Character - 5/10 
 
The most consistent aspect of the show, was the portrayal and explanations of the characters. The producers were able to explain the basic aspects of each character, their backgrounds, and kept the characters consistent to what that character would actually do in that situation. All of the characters felt different and each had their good side and bad side (Also as I said earlier, some things were retconned from Jin's original work, so this may piss off some of the fans who have been with the characters since the PVs). I really enjoyed the work of the VAs and thought they suited their characters really well. 
 
Enjoyment - 8/10 
 
Whilst there were a lot of bad aspects to the show, I believe that the good shines brighter than the bad, and for some reason it was able to keep me enthralled week after week after week. I guess I just really enjoyed the feeling of the anime, and truly felt pleasant to watch. 
 
Overall - 6/10 
 
In conclusion, I'd say that the problems this anime faced was a rushed schedule and not enough episodes to properly convey the story, given these things, I feel like the anime could have been a huge success and more enjoyable that it has already been. However bad the anime seems, it's a useful tool for any of the dedicated fans of the series, as it helps explain the links between the PVs, characters and helped to explain how the members of the Mekakushi Dan ended their tale (and if you don't like the retconning, then just disregard it and wait for the manga to end). 
 
I'd recommend anyone who enjoyed this series to check out the manga and PVs as you might enjoy those too!

    It's tough writing negative reviews, because for some reason people who've already seen the anime want to come along and rate it as useless because they disagree. But this review is for people who haven't seen this anime yet. 
 
Let's be clear on this one. One of the reasons I dislike this anime may be because it made me face the horrible realisation that I might just be too old for it (I'm 26, so maybe 14 years too old). 
 
Elfen Lied is a harem anime featuring a collection of bulging-eyed stereotypes (including pathetic bitches) crossed with extreme violence to the point of perversion. If this sounds like it may appeal to you then you certainly aren't alone. 
 
Anyway, let's consider the plot before we start ranting about how shit it is. 
 
There exist certain people on Earth that have conspicuous horns growing from their heads. The female versions of these people have a varying number of invisible arms that can be used as weapons. These people are also usually very angry about something, and unsympathetic to any concept of compassion. Like an evil Tachikoma... maybe. 
 
Anyway one day one of these bad girls washes up on a beach where she is picked up by some guy who takes her home with him. Said guy has just been placed in charge of an old ryoukan with ten rooms, which he then goes about blandly and cluelessly populating with other stigmatised young women. Sexually embarrassing situations arise, and so do disturbing yet poorly animated scenes of bodily mutilation and relentless, unapologetic killing. 
 
 
Story 5/10. 
 
 The series doesn't start very well. A young, horned girl breaks out of a secure facility by killing everyone. She is also completely naked. She then runs away and turns up on the beach to be picked up by this guy. Only now she has spazzed-out into some pathetic little shit who can't say anything except the grating-cute ""nyuuuuuu!"". She also doesn't know anything about anything and ends up sat in a puddle of her own piss. But it's all very cute and erotic and lalala. Then the girls take off their clothes and have a bath. Then the guy gets in compromising situations with the annoying exhibitionist in front of his cousin (who incidentally fancies him) and its all so very charming and stereotypical hahahaha..... 
 
 Then people get brutally murdered again and chicks get naked again. Repeat, repeat. 
 
 I think the horned-people want to rule the world, or something. They hate humans because they pick on them and kick their puppies and shit. So if humans won't accept them, then they must ""make a world for [them]selves"". What that means isn't explained, but I guess it has something to do with removing humans from the picture. The rest of the plot is nonsense filler about the characters and their history, including a totally implausible ""we knew each other as kids"" backstory, and a ""revelation"" which I want so badly to shout about because it is so stupid, but don't want to 'spoil' for anyone out there who can't work it out from the heavy-handed hints throughout the short series. 
 
 The idea of the soft-hearted girl with the hidden harsh personality is certainly not new. The first thing to come to mind is the vastly superior initial OVA series of 3x3 Eyes. Except in 3x3 Eyes the calm version of Pai actually has some charisma. 
 
 One of my major issues with this anime is the liberal use of nudity. Worse, child nudity. Warning: this series contains many, many shots of 13 year old girls in the buff. In fact, it shows just about as graphic scenes of child porn as is (for some reason) allowed by the censors. We're talking full pussy shots on all fours. That shit is fucked up. What's more fucked up is that that is the most sexual of all the nudity in the series. Every episode (and the entirity of the opening and closing credits) bulges with breast and pussy shots, but they are so badly drawn as to not have any effect on anyone over 12. However, when the young-guns come out, the poses and situations get more and more perverse. I know 13 is technically the age of consent in Japan, but come on. 
 
 The violence is way over the top throughout, and the style often reminds me more of Ikkitousen than any attempt at being vaguely serious. The less bloody ecchi moments, too, defy all logic. One girl allowed herself to be groped by another girl for a full two minutes while doing nothing but blushing and weakly saying ""I said no"". This kind of pathetic clown is one of the worst traits of Japanese media. 
 
 Towards the end the series is plagued by bawling sentimentalism. It manages to convey at least some feeling, and does feel like it picks itself up a little. But it is ultimately too little, too late. It was interesting, however, and the only time when you are actually asked to consider the characters as the children they are instead of just hard-ass emotional wrecks. 
 
 
Animation 6/10. 
 
 Considering the hype there always was around this series, it is strange to see how low the animation quality is. The framerate is not good at all, the designs are sloppy, and the locations are severly limited/similar (though often nicely detailed). 
 
 
Sound 4/10. 
 
 Rubbish. Only one or two different songs performed in a variety of ways. Boring. ""Nyuuuuuu""! 
 
 
Characters 5/10. 
 
 Tired stereotypes by the bundle. Huge, plump eyes even grace the dopey male lead; shit hairstyles in stupid colours too. All very nice and cute, and clearly intended to be in juxtaposition with the bloody violence. However, rather than working to make it all the more powerful, it just looks wrong. It doesn't work. The violence is more like a sexual perversion in this setting. 
 
 And just when you thought all the characters were present and accounted for, there's the guy with the spiky black hair and the very reflective glasses. Oh, and what's he doing? He's pushing those glasses up his nose with his middle finger while giving the camera a slightly sideways smirk. Holy shit. I promised that I would kill a man if I watched another anime featuring him, but when it comes down to it all I want to do is kill myself. 
 
 The only good character, literally, is the bad-ass soldier guy. He punches women in the face in a way that makes me think he is angry to be in the show at all. Winner. 
 
 The harem is an often-referenced bad point of the show, and I won't disagree. As if two sworn enemies would live together. One has her arms and legs cut off by the other, then agrees to live with her. Whatever. The harem-hotel is where the series abandon's all sense of seriousness and becomes more like a gorey Tenchi Muyo. 
 
 I guess the main theme is stigma, but I'm confused. The pathetic ""nyuuu"" chick is some kind of anti-hero by all accounts. It seems like we are supposed to feel sympathy for this girl who indescriminately kills people. Hell, the cast seems to manage it. At one point a very young ""Nyu"" gets bullied, so she kills all the kids bullying her (otaku revenge anyone?) and then goes on a rampage killing families for a place to stay. There is little about that that says ""poor victim"". Nothing really makes me feel anything for this character. Certainly nothing balances how damn annoying she is in every scene. I suppose we should believe that she cannot control her power, but without something likable is it almost impossible to feel any balance. It's interesting that you are ostensibly 'supposed' to feel sympathy for a child who wants to be human but cannot embrace any element of morality or compassion. Look at Tetsuo in Akira; he ruthlessly murders people and barges through Tokyo on a wave of destruction. But throughout the whole movie he somehow retains sympathy for his problems. Nothing like that applies to Elfen Lied. 
 
 Also, why the hell don't the girls in the series kill each other? They have an inexplicable tendency to push each other about and/or give each other a slap. You want them dead, so use your silly arms and kill them like you kill everyone else! 
 
 
Overall 5/10. 
 
 Some anime forces you to look beyond the stereotypes and tired themes for the real story. I tried that with Elfen Lied and all I got was this lousy review.

    Upon gazing at the ridiculously short synopsis and the total episode number, I was convinced that there is nothing too special to see here. And looking back on complaints with its first run five years ago under “Yozakura Quartet,” I was skeptical on how this reboot will deliver. How wrong I was; this anime left me with a lasting impression. You might have been put off too, but don’t back away now, because the simplistic synopsis is not all what this anime has to offer. 
 
Given the synopsis and thirteen-episode span, I was led to believe that this anime’s storyline wouldn’t get past a good mark. That proves to be quite true when it isn’t so often that the characters do their duties of kicking butt and defending the city and rather spend time dilly-dallying with ramen and swimming pools. But when they do, it is quality over quantity in this case, and each few moments of action deliver well as it also continues from building on one event to the next within the mastermind’s hands. Coupled with the soundtrack ranging towards some snazzy rushing tunes, the action is displayed well when the characters do their duties. Animation-wise, the fluidity is crisp and well-done in the fights; that makes the very few fights in this anime to have some high quality features. The amusing methods that each character employs in battle could be as outlandish as it is enjoyable (epic too). 
 
The action and animation are eye-catching, but when it comes to plot concerns, the anime comes to a slow crawl that later picks ups half-way. The characters are confined to one area (their city), and the plot only demands action when there’s a crazy hub-bub that wants to destroy the peace. By the synopsis’s implication, it is as if the anime is to be mainly packed with constant supernatural skirmishes every episode with new villains. That isn’t what it truly offers though. Now what does this anime offer that makes it entirely unique? Characters that transform this shounen into something different. 
 
The scope of the anime doesn’t primarily zone in on action, fanservice, and comedy, the scope seems to zone in on the characters. These types of characters aren’t exactly impressive, but the anime does create a sweet character depth and also pokes into their relationships with the others. It tends to poke into the themes of expectation and burden, especially in regards to Akina and Hime. And it does exploration for all characters along with suiting music. For a shounen anime in a fantasy setting to have slice-of-life themes in its mix, it does so pretty well. Their backstories are explored and the viewers are now given some emotional attachment to them if not all.  
 
I think this is impressive for a thirteen-episode shounen anime. It was as if Yasuda Suzuhito was trying to implement slice-of-life themes here instead of typical shounen ones. Usually, viewers are already drawn to the convictions of shounen characters, but the convictions for these characters are not so hero-like in the traditional sense. They appeal to nearly real-world internal struggles that people tend to face in their days. The character arcs mainly focus on that, few episodes are dedicated to that as well. Forget about never giving up and protecting others, Yozakura Quartet is a mixed-bag of slice-of-life themes presented in a shounenesque way.  
 
That is all it can ever be though, a mixed-bag. And I don’t think that is a subjective term for this anime. As convoluted as to where the focus and drive of the anime is as a whole, it seems to do it justice, and it probably was intentional. The OP song is breathes in excitement and merriment which links to the seriousness and cheeriness of the anime, while the ED song seems to remind us about how important the characters’ state of minds are to give an impact to the series. This is done in many anime I’m sure, but the songs do help with what the anime is about with the moods that the songs bring out. I think it is hard to pin down where the actual focus is, but the fact is that the characters are what run the show with every importance. Quirky, yes they are. Deep, somewhat so, and that level of depth should be tolerable and forgivable. 
 
What’s even more respectable about Yozakura Quartet: HNU is that it does not suffer from a genre identity crisis. It does not try too hard for one thing, so it shoots down expectations from any side of the genre spectrum by balancing and shifting between action and play while it maintains the charming and optimistic childish aura that it exudes in even the direst situations.  But that does not stop it from being critiqued on its ‘apparent’ potential, for I can see people wanting it to go beyond its mediocre interplay between the genres. So look away now if you are the viewer who is looking for something along the specific lines. Yozakura Quartet: HNU is not made for that. It’s made to appeal to those who are looking for something ‘different.’ 
 
The efforts made into this anime shine pretty well with intended mediocrity. The mixed action and character back-stories are the crux of the series, but plot-wise, viewers who start watching will finally be ‘rewarded’ for the real story behind this special town and the clouds that are beginning to storm in.  
 
The storytelling is not so stellar, for the actual mystery and interesting info are only touched upon near the end of the anime, and towards the end, the whole setting and continuing devices of storytelling becomes even more predictable. There will still be the same kind of conflict, but with more detail added on regarding the secrets behind certain main characters. One should keep in mind of the true story that this anime is trying to tell. Although unfinished, from start to end, it has left me satisfied with anticipation. This makes the story tolerable somewhat, and it ought to be excused. 
 
What is a tad inexcusable is the anime’s way of evoking emotion from the viewer. Even typical shounen anime can rally a nearly absurd amount of sympathy and emotion from. The way that this anime tries to evoke some sympathy is half-baked and isn’t dramatic enough. This clash between shounen and slice-of-life doesn’t work too well in the emotional department. What it does instead is to create an understanding of the characters, not to create sympathy for them. There isn’t anything wrong with that, but expectations and standards are not appealed. I think because many viewers are already used to specific slice-of-life and shounen anime, the result that this hybrid-genre anime gives off remains unfulfilled. That makes it’s ‘mistakes and flaws’ hard to accept was the reason why I even considered dropping the anime, but the important thing is that this is what this breed of an anime is trying to do.Even though the anime tries shoot down expectations, handling that with an open-mind could take some effort into getting used to. That may put off some people from continuing to watch. 
 
Nevertheless, this is a decent anime with my enjoyment stemming from the fights and the internal conflicts that the main characters have. It personally did not make me strongly react, but I can’t help but admire at what it does. Had it did evoke a strong reaction, this anime would have deserved some more praise, but it does what it does somewhat well, and it works.  
 
At least the captivating art style helps make up for its ‘mediocrity’. The city gives off a fresh feel of security, while at night it turns mysterious and dangerously exciting. Characters are not glazed like porcelain dolls, for they are more akin to the cleanliness of Durarara. It also packs a similar atmosphere, but in a more merry way. Given the whole convoluted feel of focus and whims, the art style definitely fits with the plot’s antics. The anime is like a bowl of piping hot ramen (Hime’s favorite food), a meal that combines a variety of tasteful ingredients where taste and flavor are balanced (although the overall quality might be something to gag at depending on personal tastes). 
 
But does it appeal to you? Who knows. Just hope that you get a good flavor from that mixed-bag of tea. It just might be your cup. And it is gladly mine. Give it a try and you’ll be in for a lasting experience, for better or worse. 
 
*NOTE: When watching this anime, the OVA Yozakura Quartet: Hoshi no Umi takes place prior to Episode 9 and after Episode 8.

    I did enjoy the series for the most part but there were a few things that did bother me. Some stuff we just were not given answers for in the end. It's unfortunate because I did feel it had some decent potential overall. I was caught by surprise when we found out that Yorito was simply just a mere illusion. That was really when the show definitely piqued my interest. The character that I enjoyed the most ended up dying for the sake of giving Aono another chance to live as a normal human. I felt that the one truly deserving of being given another chance to live was definitely Mayuko. At the same time I do understand why Aono was given one, a chance to grieve over Yorito death I suppose. But it didn't help at all how over-possessive and bitchy she tended to behave. Definitely a character who deserves to be well disliked. It was more difficult to sympathize with her when you have Mayuko who's pushed aside. However to be somewhat positive on the ending, I did like how it emphasized on the sky connecting them all together. Perhaps for now I'd give this a solid 6. This is my first review but I just felt compelled to do one on this.

    Story? Uh... we get to see one guy having sex with his ten sisters, none of which seem to be related to him or to each other by blood ties. That's it. Huh? What are you talking about? Plot twists? Reveals? Character development? What's that? ...Well, one of the ladies in Episode 2 turns out to be... nah, you check it out. 
 
The male lead is plain-looking. All of the ladies are voluptuous, some looking more mature and others a bit younger. Each one has a distinctive design, and their own naughty fetish. Each voice fits each character well. Music and SFX is nothing remarkable, neither positively nor negatively. 
 
Each sex scene involves different situations. From a typical bedroom, to roof sex, office sex, sex in the job, office sex, a bit of whipping and light bondage sex in a porn studio, bathroom sex, car sex... it seems the writer had a big checklist! 
 
It's a Family Affair / Ane to Boin is an enjoyable ride, yet there's a big downside: After a they're done with a girl, she won't show up again, with just a few exceptions. I guess that the writer hadn't ever heard about orgies... there's a short group scene, but it's at the end of the last episode, and it's not even that long... 
 
There may not much story here, but if well-endowed women, great variety in character design and scenarios, sex, sex and lots of sex is what you're after, this is for you.

    This is my first review so please bear with me. I also apologize in advance if I use any profanity or capitalization of words.   
 
Characters:  
For our main male character, we have Kirito, an ace player of the game. He is an excellent swordsman, is way too easy to beat and is for the most part unbeatable. Maybe it is a good thing for him in a life-or-death situation, but to watch as entertainment is just plain predictable. He seems to somehow overpower every single opponent he encounters, while I'm just sat in front of my laptop just thinking: ""He's gonna win this."" Maybe if he came in the game not as experienced then it would be more fun watching him learn and grow as a character. But no. When it comes to romance he seems to be pretty much the same. Most female character he encounters seems to fall head over heels in love with him, even creating is own harem (which includes his own FREAKING COUSIN). Maybe apart from Asuna, this seemed to really annoy me. He also lacks personality, which just makes him really bland. Hell, even the parody YouTube videos seemed to make him  lot more interesting and fun than the one in the actual series.  
 
Our female lead character, Asuna, is just a generic Tsundere. In the first episode she appeared in, she had so much potential: being new to the game she is a pretty skilled player and seems pretty badass. She also seems to be a pretty good leader. But,she turns out to be another tsundere with not a lot else. Yeah, sure she's badass but that's it. THAT'S IT. Nothing else. And then her and Kirito always need to be together ALL THE FREAKING TIME.  
 
The side characters. Oh, the side characters. They had the potential to be good, but they just weren't when I wanted them to be. They came in at some point but were just shoved to the side to never be seen again or came on only a few times. I really wanted Kline to have a decent back story, development and screen time, but no. It never happened.  
 
Last but not least, the wonderful creator  of Sword Art Online himself. He was just blah. Just plain blah. No motivations were explained as to why he trapped so many people in a game. Nope. Nothing.  
 
Art: 
 
The art is stunning, quite frankly. It's really nice and fluid throughout the series, along with amazing scenery even during the filler episodes. Scenery looks good, just not the fanservice.  
 
Sound: 
 
Opening and ending fit the show well,  even if it's not the type of music I normally listen to. The voice acting is alright.  
 
Story:  
 
The premise sounds okay even if I've heard it before. The first episodes are somewhat decent, introducing the characters and the plot. Before we know it months have passed and thousands of players have died off screen and we're not even showed a short montage? No. The first two are only really the decent ones in the entire show so make sure you make the most of them.  
 
The third episode quickly tries to form emotional bonds to characters just in a few minutes which just comes off as ridiculously rushed.  
 
Next comes romance in the air and harem antics. The next few episodes are all about some girls falling in love with Kirito the same day they meet him. This also involves fanservice, blushing and tsundere actions. These episodes are pretty much filler.  
 
The biggest problem is filler. Too much filler. Somehow they manage to find time to resurrect a dragon, marry Asuna, go on a honeymoon, solve a 'murder', eat and go fishing while trying to get back into reality. Everyone loves fishing in a VIDEO GAME, right? This just follows with eye ball rolling melodrama, tears and promises of love. The surprising thing is that this happened in around fourteen episodes. Yes, there are eleven left.  
 
The last half is just pretty much the same as the first but without the life or death aspect. It goes downhill from there. It's just completely unnecessary. They should have just delete those eleven episodes and finish it right there. But no, it shreds up every piece of dignity it had left.  
 
Another problem is that the show just takes its self way too seriously. It makes it look like a super serious adventure inside a video game, but it just came off as a group of idiots messing around. I think that you should just switch off your brain when watching this. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
Switch your brain off when you're watching this, unlike I did. Action and sound was great but just don't expect a lot from the characters and story. I could sit back after watching an episode and go ""Ahh. That episode was awesome."" but somewhere in my brain I'm saying ""Oh my God. Really? You've gotta be kidding, right?"" Just to reiterate, make sure you switch your brain off or don't think too much while watching this because it makes it look like a bunch of idiots messing around in a video game.

    One of the most hyped-up anime films in the recent years, Kimi No Na Wa tells a story about two completely different people: a boy from the city, and a girl from the countryside...both wanting to break out of the shell of their rather redundant lives. By the sheer chance of fate and a big help from the oh-so-supernatural essence of the cosmos, they go through a weird case of experiencing each other's livelihood....via body switching. From there, the drama and romance begins... 
 
It took me a while to actually get myself to watch it a good while after the blu-ray and DVD versions came out, and even a lot longer to now to post this review on it. 
 
I'll be honest: while I think that this movie is VERY good, I also think it's still VERY overrated. I don't feel good about doing long reviews, so I'll try to break it down as well as I can while keeping it shorter and simple. 
 
(MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS) 
STORY: What turned out at first as a rather discombobulated romance comedy....did itself well with a rather nasty twist on the entirety of the story. The usage of the whole time paradox thing, where the boy was basically interacting with someone who had been killed by a tragic city-scale event (via comet fragments) from a few years ago, was actually a well-done plot twist, imo, and thus made the two main characters' desire to find each other that much more heartfelt, as they both try to undo the tragedy of the girl's own timeline. However, the story by itself has faults in being way too predictable, simple, and/or generic. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it kinda just makes the story feel dry for the majority of the movie. And oh yeah, the cliffhanger ending....don't even get me started...no, I actually wasn't mad, I really kinda expected that sort of conclusion. The way they concluded the movie was neither bad nor good, but very predictable, honestly. It left some people feeling satisfying with a heartfelt ending, while it left others bitter and wanting more from the story. Overall, the story does get an above average grade. 
 
ART: While it's not the best animation I've ever seen, it certainly is one of the most fitting styles of animation for its respective story, settings, and characters. Personally I would be somewhat offput by this kind of style, the way they did in the movie, it was nearly a perfect masterpiece. The vivid movements and color variations/contrasts added such a surreal atmosphere to the movie as it prevents one from looking away, gathering all of one's attention. The animation is gonna force you to pay attention to every detail while not trying to do too much, either. 
 
SOUND: This is on a personal level. I really liked the soundtracks, but I didn't exactly love them. They do well to fit in with their respective scenes, from the laid-back cozy tracks, to the city-style hustle-bustle music, to the dramatic emotion-filled songs. The music score really enhances one's experience during the entire story. 
 
CHARACTER: I do like the characters a lot because their behavior and personalities are somewhat relatable to my own youthful experiences back in high school, more or less, albeit with significant differences. While I can't completely relate myself to Taki and Mitsuha, both of them do remind of a good handful of my former high school classmates that I knew well at the time, whose personas are quite similar. That being said, the movie, having a limit on time, only covered the surface of the main characters' background, leaving most of us wondering about all the possibilities, and I really felt that it could've been handled a bit better. I really wished that the story dove more into the emotions and interactions of the characters to make us feel for and relate more to them. However, the film just continued with the cliche tropes and never turned back. One particular thing that did kinda tick me off was how reckless the characters can be, especially the main ones...in fairness, we've all done weird, boneheaded things at some points in our lives, especially during our youth. 
 
ENJOYMENT: Despite the stuff I did have to really point out, I did throughly enjoy the film from start to finish. I get my bunch of laughs (especially during the boob-grabbing moments or gags) and my share of SMH moments as well. Those kind of reactions the film got from me really enhanced my experience of the film. Now at the start, I did get impatient on how aimless the story felt AT that time, but as it progressed, I got more and more impressed, save for the faults I pointed out earlier in this review. It was especially great to watch Taki and Mitsuha go through so much struggles and emotions, and understand and feel for them at the same time. As for the ending, unlike most people, I had that ""of course the staff would do that"" kind of reaction...now I'll be real, I do personally wish that they did some sort of sequel continuation in an anime series of the two main characters' progressing stories to make a better conclusion. At the same time, though, I know it's asking too much, so I'm more or less okay with the ending I got. One more thing, though......I was never a fan of time travel or time paradox stuff, with the exception of Steins;Gate., but the story, settings, and characters were good enough to where I eventually felt alright with it. One more thing, I do want to point out how well the movie used trains for metaphors and symbolism, similar to that from the 2007 film 5 Centimeters per Second. 
 
OVERALL: This is one of those shows or films that is more than just any anime production. Granted, I honestly think it was a bit too overhyped, but I also do think it deserved some portion of the hype. Even though my overall score of this film was relatively low, I'd still recommend this movie to just about anyone wanting to watch a good movie in general (even if it's mostly generic as hell). I feel that the character interactions and the furious drama was the biggest selling point of this movie, if not the animation. Most likely or not, you probably won't regret watching Kimi No Na Wa, one of the best anime movies in the recent years....just a reminder, brace yourself for the ending, if you're not emotionally ready.

    Okay Lion Tamers, it's time to begin again, with a new review; of Claymore. 
 
I saw an advertisement for this anime, and became intrigued. Finding it streaming, I caught a few episodes; and finally downloaded all of them for viewing the entire series. 
 
Firstly, I want to talk about some of the characters. 
1). Raki is a pain in the behind, with little plot value, and adds nothing to the story. A total wimp, who faces everything like a participant in a Beauty Contest ""... I want World Peace ..."". He will never understand that his world's game of life is rigged, and that Clare cannot escape from the rules of the game, if she never tries to alter the views of the game-masters. 
 
2). Clare is passable as a character, but is far too dependant on her past, to face the future. 
 
3). Muria is totally focussed on the future (and rightly so), but is never expanded upon in the story line properly. 
 
Next I want to talk about the music. 
While some of the between scene music is passable, much of it is inappropriate or just plain lousy. The opening and closing music is downright terrible; so poor is it that I often found myself almost quiting the series. 
 
And for the final critique (and here's where I'm completely innovative), the entire series anime and manga are a spectacularly better looking version of ""DragonBall Z"". Comments like ""... I Need More Power ..."" and ""... I'm Going To Kill You ..."" are everywhere, and are a dead-ringer for plot points for DragonBall-Z et al. 
 
Now for the review commentary. 
The worst part of this show, should have  been the basic direction of the story. The ""Organization"" (for those who have seen this show) should have been the main focus. They're crooks, manipulative, and outright corrupt. If I had to make a judgement, I'd have to say that the entire story wrongly misses that the Organization formed the Yoma (evil monsters) so that they could also produce the solution Claymores (the saviors) in order to financially (and politically) fleece the general public. If that is true, and I think it is, then the authors of the Manga and the anime, have created a felonious assault on the viewer's belief system; because they have left all of us, with nothing but never-ending combat; while promising something more, grander and better. Never to be delivered. 
 
This story will never get any better. While Claymore is dark, moody, and atmospheric (which I like); it might as well have been written in the the comic style of a TV sitcom for all its story line strength. 
 
I really don't like writing negative reviews, but it is necessary in this case. Claymore is a huge disappointment. I give it a five (5); only because the artwork and character development is fairly good. The story is never going to fulfill its promise.

    I""s Pure was recommended to me by a friend. I read the manga during my commute time and watched the anime during my free time. Reading the manga in advance, I was really expecting great things from the ova. The 6 episode ova series was great, but it could have been better. Squeezing all 15 volumes (143 chapters) manga into a 6 episode ova, what would you expect. Some of the good part from the manga, which IMO made the story richer, was left out. Although all the important part were included, the pacing of the series is somewhat fast passed, giving little time to the audience to fully digest the story and the emotion that it conveys. 
 
Overall, I would say that this is one of the best series out there. There's only few anime series out there that would remain in your memory for a very long time, and I""s Pure is one of them. 
 
It's been a while since this ova series has been released. I hope someone would pick it up and create a full anime series (12 or 24 episodes or more) that is closer to the manga.

    Hype is the first thing that pops up in your head when hear One Punch Man, and why wouldn't it. One Punch Man fans have been extremely excited ever since it was confirmed to get an anime series. Nevertheless, with hype comes a lot of expectations. One mess up and you’ll get hate from both manga/webcomic fans and those who wanted to see what One Punch Man is all about. Luckily Madhouse knows what they’re doing very well and they didn’t disappoint. The anime is a page-by-page adaptation of what fans wanted, and what newcomers are now interested in. Its satirical style parodying shounen and superhero tropes makes this a breath of fresh air in the anime medium. A gateway anime to many, One Punch Man helps in increasing the anime community. 
 
~{Story}~ 
The story focuses on Saitama, an average, bald-headed, expressionless man. However, little can one expect him to be the strongest man on earth who defeats all of his opponents with just one punch (hence the title!). The problem is that he is so strong that he is craving for a strong enough opponent so he can have fun with what he’s doing. The story right off the bat feels very unique. Many anime focus on the protagonist becoming more and more powerful. However One Punch Man focuses the aftermath of that story, and how being the strongest may not be as good as it sounds. Though it may see uninteresting at first, because for how long can you have fun with a protagonist that is flawless in his strength, however the anime does a great job handling that as it’s jokes end up staying fresh and its focus on other characters makes you still keep your interest. One Punch Man may not have the most fantastically written story, but it gets the job done. And it’s the simplicity of the story that makes it the more enjoyable. Just leave your brain somewhere else and you’ll have a blast with One Punch Man.  
Story: 8.5/10 
 
~{Presentation}~ 
As a superhero-action anime, it delivers with its large-scale battles. As a parody-comedy it delivers with its satirical humor and hilarious characters. One Punch Man exactly what it is and it makes sure to only focus on that. No deep messages (besides Mumen Rider’s speech), no buildup, no tragic storylines, just a crap load of fun. One Punch Man is sort up built up of small story arcs that rarely connect to one another besides its characters. And each arc delivers in entertainment, whether it be large-scaled, beautifully animated action, or slapstick humor. The pacing is also really good, as the anime takes its time on focusing on other characters and delivering consistent entertainment without any empty moments. The concept of One Punch Man is something that easily could have been a disaster, but luckily doesn’t. It’s absolutely perfect in its presentation. It’s an anime that can bring in the most experienced anime watchers, and those who are entering this medium and are new to it. It parodies on superheroes is something that can appeal to a larger audience than just anime fans. The mixture of comedy and action makes this one of the greatest anime to come in recent times. 
Presentation: 9.5/10

Saitama is a breath of fresh air in terms of action protagonists. Most characters focus on getting stronger, Saitama would envy those characters as he is too strong to enjoy his fights, if they can even be considered as fights. Saitama is hilarious and badass at the same time, so no wonder why he is so likeable. Saitama’s transition from a detailed expression to expressionless will get me every time. Saitama’s disciple, Genos, is one complete badass. He wants to become stronger, and Saitama is his hope. Even if he gets his ass kicked more than he does to others, his style and fighting skills are what makes him get a lot of fans, in the anime and outside. One Punch Man offers a humongous cast of character and each of them are unique in their own way. You have Sonic, the baddie that can’t admit someone can be stronger than him, Mumen Rider, who may not have the most strength, but he has the most heart, and so much more. The heroes impress with their uniqueness and their humorous presentation, the villains impress with their over-the-top concepts and designs. There’s always a character you end up loving in One Punch Man, because of the likeability of all of the characters. However, there are some characters that do get sidelined at times are just used to merely be a contrast for Saitama. However characters are great enough to cover up this flaw. 
Character: 9/10 
 
~{Art}~,  
Madhouse really went on point with the art of One Punch Man. There were two ways to tackle it: make the art cruddy looking to add to the humor (just like the webcomics), or make the art extremely detailed and fancy (like the manga remake). Madhouse manages to find a place between the two as the anime uses sketchy-style drawing as an effect, yet have detailing that makes the anime still gorgeous. This way, the studio gets to please both webcomics and manga fans, while bringing in new fans. The backgounds are well detailed. The color palette is restricted for the better. Vivid and bright colors wouldn’t work with One Punch Man, so the limited color usage is great. The character designs are superbly presented. Each character looks totally unique in their own ways. Characters such as Watchdog Man wearing a dog costume to fight crime is just one of the many ridiculous designs this anime has to offer. Not to mention Genos looks extremely great with his cyborg design. And the most important part, Saitama is designed perfectly with him jumping around between an excited character with a detailed, buffed-up design, to an unenthusiastic, minimal detailed, average looking character.  
Art: 10/10 
 
~{Animation}~ 
Just like the art, Madhouse manages to deliver extremely smooth animations that can satisfy for webcomics and manga fans. The sketchy and smooth feeling combine to make superb animations. With its large-scale battles, all over-the-top, the animations bring those to life. The smooth rotations used in this anime show how beautifully animated it is. The contrast between the over-the-top animations with Saitama’s simplistically drawn face adds up to its already excellent humor. Only very few anime can be so consistent with its style and One Punch Man manages to succeed. The animations are so fast that they don’t give you time to breath and that is just perfect. The fast-pacing and the animations perfectly blend together. Not to mention that the final fight was so well done, and so well stylized that I couldn’t help but grin like a creep for the entire episode. There are very slight hiccups with the animations, but they easily get overshadowed with the animations that are great in One Punch Man. Also character movements have a very realistic feeling to it (such as Mumen Rider getting of his bicycle). The realism makes it feel like as if the animations were rotoscoped at times. 
Animation: 10/10 
 
~{Voice Acting}~ 
Since there is an abundance of characters in One Punch Man, a large seiyuu cast is required. The two main characters of One Punch Man, is voice acted by seiyuu that weren’t much heard of, yet they still manage to do an excellent job as Saitama and Genos. Furukawa Makoto does a great job as Saitama as he can give both energy and a lack enthusiasm at perfect times. He is the perfect voice for Saitama. And it’s funny how they got a zero to voice act Satama and after this anime he might become a hero. Ishikawa Kaito does Genos and he does it perfectly. He is able to add the coolness to Genos and that desperation of trying to get stronger. He really did make Genos into a fan magnet with his voice acting skills. A lot of big name seiyuu do some pretty minor characters, considering their talent. Miyano Mamoru is Amai Mask, Namikawa Daisuke is Doctor Genus and Pig God, Hayami Saori is Fubuki, Sawashiro Miyuki is Mosquito Girl, Nakamura Yuuichi is Mumen Rider, Miki Shinichiro is Snek, Kaji Yuki is Sonic, Yuuki Aoi is Tatsumaki, and Sakurai Takahiro is Zombieman (He only said one line!). Everyone manages to do fantastic with their role, because of their excellent skills. 
Voice Acting: 9/10 
 
~{Music}~ 
At first, I was pretty afraid about the music as One Punch Man needs the perfect music to be more than what it can be. Once again, One Punch Man doesn’t disappoint in this category. The Opening “THE HERO !!”, is perfect as it perfectly represents what this anime is about. It’s super catchy and it warms you up for what is yet to come. However the ending “Hoshi yori Saki ni Mitsukete Ageru”, is the complete opposite as it’s too peaceful and soothing to be an One Punch Man ending. However, that’s what makes it more enjoyable as it adds so much irony to the anime. Not to mention it’s a beautiful song. The OST is outstanding. Every track impresses. Its adrenaline filled beats are sure worth listening to on repeat. The Genos Theme in particular is what impressed me the most. And the OST that is played when Saitama gets the job done is perfect too. Oh, and who can forget Mumen Rider’s Theme! The music is so well placed during the action scenes that I couldn’t be more impressed as a One Punch Man fan. 
Music: 10/10 
 
~{Enjoyment}~ 
The entertainment values One Punch Man has is through the roof. With is hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, its parodies on superhero and shounen tropes and its large-scale battles, you’ve got one entertaining anime. Add the beautiful animations and art, and some fantastic background music, and you’ve got this anime elevated to a whole new level. One Punch Man’s got something for everyone, whether they be experienced anime watchers on newcomers, One Punch Man is here to appeal to anyone. It manages to please One Punch Man’s webcomic and manga fans as it incorporates both styles together in one in the anime version. 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
Overall, One Punch man is a breath of fresh air in the anime medium. It’s a great gateway anime for those who aren’t familiar with the anime medium, and its feels something unique and fresh for those who have been watching anime for a long time. It pleases manga and webcomic fans by being loyal to the original source. With its great humor and over-the-top action, mixed with its high production values, great animations and fantastic music, it’s a complete entertainer. If you haven’t watched the most hyped anime of the decade yet, you’re missing out. Try it out and see how you like it! I’ll be off to make some more One Punch Man gifs! 
 
+ A complete entertainer in both comedy and action.  
+ Fantastic concept about the life of an overpowered character. 
+ Great cast of characters, that are all unique and they stand out from one another. 
+ Production values are through the roof as the art and animations are some of the best ever made. 
+ The OST is superb as it is totally adrenaline boosting.  
- Some supporting characters get side-lined at times. 
 
Overall: 9.4/10

    ""Perfect Blue"" is a great movie that follows the literary ""Fall from Grace"" situational archetype. This is an exciting psychological thriller with a lot of twists and turns, while managing to stay cohesive. It's not a small feat to execute this type of story, while keeping the viewer on the same page.  
The director managed to convey the confusion and psychological turmoil that the protagonist was going through. The shift in mood was so well-done, that it almost made the viewer experience the events through her eyes. 
The character design and its wide variety of facial expressions and body language managed to convey the ideas directly.  
I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy psychological thrillers.

    This is actually one of those anime which is  more relatable to an actual cartoon with a little more depth,drama and hint of  manga styled comedy the violence is just hilarious  half of the time they're just shooting and blasting everything on sight. 
 
This show sadly never made it outside Asia or at least in any eng speaking region so this isn't much popular on the web only thing you can actually find about this show is some bootlegs VCD's or youtube videos no torrents or live streams sorry. 
 
Story:7/10 
 
The story in this show opens and ends in a very old styled fashion like ranma1/2 story isn't really cohesive as it is chaotic like tom&Jerry you know its  just about a housecat its not going to break new grounds. 
 
No matter how crazy the premise gets there isn't really much to the story other than kuro getting into constant trouble and saving his elderly owners which ensures hilarity. 
 
Animation:7/10 
 
It is very basic&simple  but its not too cheap either simple character designs make it easy for comedic purposes and the animation studio didn't really have good funding considering that they got bankrupt and cancelled the show so give them a break. 
 
Sound:7/10 
 
Japanese voice acting is good as far as i've seen in subbed episodes Kuro chan is actually voiced by the same voice actor as Agumon from digimon besides the music is very catchy and lighthearted. 
 
Characters:7/10 
 
Kuro: He's the main character who has a short temper and skills to build something from complete scrap yep just like Wile.E.Coyote he can build a giant turbo propelled car out of simple hunk of scrap. 
 
Grandparents: Kuro's owners who are quite simply are not aware of anything going around and are constantly getting kidnapped because of kuro,kinda like Eustace&muriel from Courage the Cowardly Dog. 
 
MI-KUN: Well i'm not Japanese so i thought his name was just ""Mikun"" turns out ""Kun"" is a Japanese honorific he's the cat who can shapeshift by attaching metal things to his body and and he can even fuse with kuro he's very gentle and shy unlike kuro. 
 
Nana: An eccentric table lamp turned into a girl robot who's lovesick with a Housecat.. LOL the hilarity  
 
Dr. Go:He's the cliched evil scientist who made kuro into a cyborg though he's not really that evil and actually ends up helping kuro all the time and all the villains are mostly just goofy except for one that is a devil virus. 
 
Matatabi:Well he's a ""Rough"" kitty who has a history with kuro and is  actually NOT A cyborg and yet can talk.. yep its very much like a cartoon now. 
 
Kotaro: A boy Genius who for some reason is obsessed with Kuro and usually hangs around with Dr.GO 
 
Overall:7/10 
 
If you're a fan of anime like Tokyo pig or shinchan or  just a fan of old school anime/cartoon with some comedy you can have plenty of fun with this show. 
 
Well if you find a complete DVDset for this anywhere that is.... >_> well atleast you can still watch some of it on youtube.

    I could say i really enjoy this Macross series, excellent music as always (in Macross), spectacular battle scenes, and intriging story.  
 
Some things could be little better for example ending but well, like with all Macross, movies would probably be released after the series, i hope it would.  
 
As i say story is good, Art very good, sound and characters 10 of 10, enjoyment and overall 10. however i cannot give 10, as there is few things that should be better but 9 is still very good. Recommending to everyone who love Macross universe because its really really good. 
 
Freya is definitly one of best character in this series, she is very cute, but again she is similar to Ranka Lee

    Review Summary: Humans live in the city, tanuki crawl the earth, and tengu fly the skies. But this show carves out a place in your heart. 
 
* * * * * 
 
""Take a moment and enjoy."" 
 
Ever heard someone tell you that in some fashion? The idea of savoring the act of simply living, experiencing life. It was pounded into my brain in the last year of my high school life. ""Enjoy this,"" they would say. ""Things like this cease to happen when you get older."" 
 
It seems common to have that sentiment. The teen years stand at the threshold between childhood and adulthood, the conceptual juxtaposition of freedom and responsibility. It's where the two realities collide, and anime as a medium is drawn to exploring the balancing act that occurs. In particular, the medium examines how a character finds himself --  how a character pairs what he gained in his freedom with what he will gain with responsibility. From that, his identity is gained. 
 
But Uchouten Kazoku is astute enough to recognize that this process is not as conveniently placed in the teen years as most anime seem to display. It continues on from there, and it is not relegated into only occurring within those few years of your life. It happens in every moment: the small lessons, the big lessons; the acquisition of a new friendship, the loss of an old one; each one, as tiny and as large as they may be, accumulate to an identity. 
 
Consider the protagonist of this story: Shimogamo Yasaborou. He is a tanuki in this Kyoto that humans, tanuki, and tengu occupy, and he is hellbent on making his life interesting. A world in which these three are commonplace may seem interesting, but to the characters, who have known this and only this, it is nothing but normal. And in the face of this, he looks to the interaction between these three communities to cure his curiosity. 
 
It is here where the show allures its audience. Not in sensational action sequences, carefully laid out drama, or over-the-top comedy. The show was not made to cater to the masses. Not one character was made to fit a trope that the audience would recognize. The characters are, simply, themselves. This is how Uchouten Kazoku casts its spell. Works about specific characters in detailed words are mesmerizing because the audience can examine how they react to certain situations and, in turn, reflect upon themselves. 
 
And the situations in the show range from the mundane to absurd. Bottled up in this fantastical iteration of Kyoto, the wondrous atmosphere the show creates is fully realized. The woods bloom with shades of green, orange, blue and purple. The moon and stars glitter, reflected on the windows in the buildings. The seemingly opposite ambiances of the city and the forest are in harmony; the two do not fight for dominance as much as they do respect the reality of their existence. Each environment is allowed to shine. 
 
Naturally is the best word to describe how the show develops. There is no feeling of artificial boosts to push the plot, no forced drama or misunderstandings. Things just happen. And as things happen, the show is confident enough to show emptiness. Silence. 
 
Throughout each episode, this emptiness shows itself, sprinkled in with the movement of the plot. It can be described as gratuitous movement -- characters moving themselves without being dictated by the story, or scenes scattered to show the world. Animations being there just for the sake of being there: running streams, faraway looks from characters, a shot of the moon. They give a sense of presence to the experience. Too many times shows focus only on engaging the audience directly, bombarding them with noise and distraction. Fearing the loss of attention, many shows pack only the loudest and most distracting peaks into a show, and little attention to the silence. 
 
Conversely, Uchouten Kazoku revels in this silence. It respects its audience enough to know that they will be able gather what the silence means: 
 
""Take a moment and enjoy.""

    This anime at the first glance shows that this is one of those anime for comical and funnies. From what I heard, the director who made ""Hare and Guu"" is in charge of this, so this already kind of gives it away that this is going to be a fun one. 
 
Much like Hare and Guu and other animes, it only goes up to certain quality of story and art, but what matters is the characters, and the anime does a good job giving a brief character description in the first episode and still be fun while elaborating it. 
 
So for those of people who want serious action, drama or love, there won't be much here (or much from what I saw), and those of who wants light, relaxed and just enjoyable entertaining and valuing funnies more, then this will be good.

    Who decides what is good or what is evil? How does one justify his/her actions based on the given situation?  That's my take away from this whole series. Don't look for a happy ending in this one. 
 
I will do this review  in two parts: 
1. General thoughts and comments 
2. Psychological discussion (main focus of this review) 
 
1. I finally finished watching Shiki and I must say it was a spectacularly dark and a very psychological horror series. Oh and did I mention extremely bloody? 
In recent years, we have seen an spike in vampire films. From the Blade series to Twilight, modern media has been infatuated with these ""bloodsuckers"" . However, Shiki diverges from the ""romanticism"" of many modern vampire fiction. This series depicts the Shiki and humans in a very primeval way. Deep down the nature of  the ""Shiki is to suck blood and the humans will do whatever it take to survive even if it means throwing away their humanity.  
 
	Blabbing about how good I personally thought the about series was won't be of much help in this review because in the end enjoyment of any series will be subjective. However, I will quickly go over the elements of this series. 
	The story of Shiki was great. It builds up slowly towards the beginning and becomes more captivating as the series progresses. There is suspense at every corner and really helps to captivate the audience. There are plenty of flashbacks to aid in character development and explanation of events. Many characters will have you sympathizing with them or simply resenting them. 
	The art work seems very colorful and the hairstyles very exaggerated at first glance but don't try to pick up hints on how the story will progress on the color alone. I think the director almost intended throw off the audience's expectations by using a very colorful and vibrant visual.  
	The characters are very diverse and developed pretty well. Their attitudes and beliefs can be easily picked up on by observing their dialogue and association with others. Their facial features or clothes can also reflect on their attitudes and behavior.  
When it comes down to the sound, there isn't anything too special worth noting but the opening and ending songs I really enjoyed .  
 
Over all enjoyment I would place at a 9/10.  
 
2.  Aside from the general comments, this is where I will put most of my thoughts and to me this is a very psychological series. As stated earlier, the take away from this series I got was ""who decides what is good and what is evil? Towards the end of the series, the line that separates humanity and the ""Shiki"" become blurred. Which side is evil and which side is good? Whose actions are correct and whose are in the incorrect? Are ""Shiki"" wrong to want to sustain themselves by feeding on humans? Are humans wrong for exterminating the ""Shiki"" in order to protect themselves and preventing a further outbreak? In terms of survival, the Shiki are not in the wrong for wanting to feed on humans to survive. Like how humans survive by killing animals, this is only natural of the Shiki to feed on humans. 
On the flip side, why do the Shiki believe every human who becomes one of them wants to be treated the same way? Blood sucking certainly seems like norm but there are a few exceptions.  
As for the humans trying to protect themselves,  when does taking measures become excessive, so much that they would discard their humanity just to exterminate the Shiki? 
 
Though in some extent the ""undead"" problem was started by the Shiki, but  the humans that become so driven by revenge and blood lust  might be ultimately no  better than the Shiki themselves.  
   
 
These are pretty tough questions to ponder but that's one of the reasons I enjoyed this series so much. As the series progresses, you will begin to wonder which side was evil and which side was good. But that line between the goodness or evilness of Shiki and humans will become blurred. 
 
I hope you all will find this series very enjoyable as I did and perhaps ponder the same questions.

    Just breezed through this anime on a lazy Sunday, and man oh man were there SO many things I'm angry about! 
 
... Okay, no, there's only one thing I'm angry at. 
 
STORY: 6. 12 episodes, and most of them are dialogues. Yes, I understand they want to set a storyline, but at times it confused me -- who's who? Another betrayal? Wait, weren't you supposed to be somewhere else!? As I type this, I'm halfway through the second series, which is another review altogether. 
I digress, though. I watched this show thinking 'oh! This would be a brilliant anime on a lazy Sunday'. No, not really. But hey, I kept watching, didn't I? 
 
ART: 9. The art is absolutely breathtaking. The countryside, the little details in the houses, etc. 
 
SOUND: 5. Not too big with the sound. Perhaps it's just me. 
 
CHARACTER: 8. NOT SO FAST! I am saving this 8 for characters that do deserve it. Who are they, you ask? Anyone that IS NOT Chizuru, the protagonist. 
Ahaha, so my rant begins: 
 
SO! Chizuru Yukimura. Where do I even begin. She's the most one-dimensional character ever. Helpless, crybaby, and her expressions only consists of: :(, or :|. I am not even kidding. SO infuriating! You have great power within you, and you decide to scream out people's names in hopes of them not attacking you, and the boys will come and rescue you in a heartbeat? Jeez, man. I'll put you in the same group as Orihime Inoue of Bleach, and that girl from Vampire Knight (for the love of anime, I cannot remember her name.) I feel like STRANGLING her if I could. She wields a sword, and 95% of the time she hardly sheathes it and puts her hand there probably deciding whether she wants to take it out or have McDonald's later on. When the enemy's sword is RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER FACE, she screams, one of the boys rescue her, she says their name and cries some more, the end. 
 
!?!?!?! WHY. You have a freakin' weapon. USE IT. No, more importantly, USE YOUR BRAIN. -frustrated sigh- There were so many times I wished to scream at my screen, but alas, it falls on deaf ears. Sigh. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 6. See: Characters. You will know why by now. 
 
OVERALL: 7. Lovely anime, lovely art, insufferable protagonist but the other characters are fine. Am I biased, you say? Probably. I don't regret watching this, though.

Well it was nice. The songs were on point and I cried to it more than I cried to that plot. Credits to radwimps. Thanks 
 
How's that for a review? Pretty vapid? That's exactly what I felt watching Your Name. The romance is pretty much forced, I could juxtapose other characters with Mitsuha and Taki would still pretty much fall in love with Rias Gremory. It just happens to have had nice moments, like what... uhh. 1, 2 or 3? Well pretty much countable with one hand, anything in between is just like my life, bland. Me aside, I mean jokes aside... Hmm isn't this joke overused? and shouldn't I be sleeping? In the midst of this rhubarb of questions, the only all-important question arises, should I watch it? Definitely.  
The art and soundtrack is the only thing out of ordinary and irrefragably memorable. This is as vanilla as it gets.

    Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this show. It's just that... some things in it just turned me off.  
 
Story is great. Whoa, mc has amnesia, he switches back every once in a while, huh? Oh look, the first episode has an obsessive girlfriend who whacks the mc's new best friend, LOL! It was a fun start and it had me watching more and more. Near the middle I just sort of got tired of the anime just dragging on how Banri still didn't recover fully. But it had a nice, heartwarming ending, so I thought it was very good. 
 
The art... I can't lie, it looks quite old. It's not terrible, but it's not breathtaking enough that I can give it a 10/10. The only reason why I put off watching this was because of the art (I'm so sorry). I have to say, there are anime with much better art than this.  
 
As for the sound, can't say it was memorable... It did fit the anime, but personally wasn't very enjoyable.  
 
Ah... Characters. Kaga is an annoying piece of **** sometimes, and she is sometimes such a terrible girlfriend. She compensates for her lack of talent and girlfriend materialness with her looks... I'm surprised Banri stuck with her until the end, after all the trouble she's caused. I'm just glad Nana had a wonderful personality, and she was a great character in the show.  
 
Overall, I just couldn't enjoy the anime much because of moments where Kaga creates such huge trouble for everyone else, and it just made me have too many cringe moments. However, the story is quite good, so I recommend this anime to those who enjoy romance with slice of life and a sprinkle of drama.

    Expect no gunfights, bastard boyfriends or manly men trying to pierce the heavens. Based on an award-winning novel, the movie's also gotten a fair share of recognition, and I can see why.  
 
Fourteen-year old Kobayashi Makoto has just committed suicide. Meanwhile, a soul carrying a heavy, unknown sin is suddenly chosen to go back to life in Makoto's body as a 'trial' to try and find out what it did, and how to redeem itself. Everything else is unwritten. 
 
It is said that there's nothing harder to work on than a blank canvas, and the soul finds out the hard way. In a way, we do, too. While the story itself is nothing breathtaking, the way the concept and themes are handled is arguably the best aspect of the movie. To me, few things are less satisfying than a work of art that will never truly end--the sort of movie, book, game to leave a mark and change my views on life. I can safely say Colorful achieved it. 
 
The animation, I'll admit, was nothing really stunning. The CG could be off-putting at times along with the real-life backgrounds. However, the art style itself turned out to be very pleasant, more leaned to a realistic style. The soundtrack was spot-on. Along the art, it effectively conveyed a tranquil, somber atmosphere, greatly complimenting the story's themes. Compared to the other aspects of the movie, though, it almost seemed a bit lackluster. 
 
I can't say much about the characters without spoiling. Aside from the main character, most of them have very little screen time except for the nameless spirit guiding 'it' and Sano, an outcast that always seems to be following 'Makoto'. However, they still managed to achieve a significant amount of depth, as most of their problems were implicit and left up to interpretation. The main character can come off as cold and even cruel at times, and 'it' should. It only makes its own development all the more outstanding. 
 
The twist at the end was, as every trope and trick nowadays, fairly predictable. And certainly fitting. It really does go along the rest of the movie in a way no other ending would. 
 
To me, it's not a work to be taken lightly. If watched correctly, it will leave you thinking. What does it really mean to be alive? To breathe? To exist?  
As an extra, the fact Makoto was an artist only made it all more symbolic. Colorful, as a whole, really twisted the ways in which I see the world--and the hues.

    ""Masamune-kun no Revenge"" (or ""Masamune's Revenge"") is an anime that had good potential, but the way that the main character acts to get his goal is something that left me upset. 
 
Story: 6/10 
The story revolves around a first-year student named Masamune who spent 8 years of his life getting in shape and improving his attractiveness. Why? To win the heart of his childhood friend, Aki, who dumped him 8 years prior and to break her heart. The only thing is, he comes to this high school with her with a different name in order to throw her off. The story basically is him trying to win her over by befriending her and getting her to open up.  
 
Art: 7/10 
The art style was alright, with the eyes looking bright and nice, the body proportions were pretty good as well.  
 
Sound: 7/10 
The OP was okay, although not memorable, as well as the ED. Nothing was bad out of the soundtrack throughout the episodes.  
 
Character: 7/10 
This anime had two characters that generally made me upset, mainly because of their personalities. Masamune is basically an asshole who wins over the hearts of many girls but is too hellbent to even consider them since he's after Aki. Aki is another character who made me laugh at points, but I honestly didn't like her for her bitchy attitude and her cruel rejections (But I guess that's how they have to portray the character). Yoshino is Aki's servant who on the outside is clumsy and stotic (Stotic like Setsuna from School Days or Koneko from High School DxD), but is really cold and deceptive, which made me interested in her façade. Neko is a kind girl who is frail due to a medical condition and is honestly my favorite character due to her personality and her kindness with the characters. There are other characters that are alright, but they're not so noteworthy as in terms of the plot.  
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
Despite the crude and ruthless intentions of Masamune, I did enjoy scenes where he tries to think his way through issues without blowing his cover, not to mention a few comedic scenes with him. I did enjoy some of the interactions with the characters, but the one thing I did enjoy was the cliffhangers some of the episodes had. They would just make me want more and more of the show and it did have me coming back for more.  
 
Overall: 7/10 
Masamune's Revenge is a good anime that has its pros and cons, but don't expect anything amazing or ""revolutionary"" for an anime series. If you want something from recent times that's good enjoy to enjoy or with a different plot compared to animes that take place in school, I recommend this anime.

    Well, here I am, writing my first-ever anime review. I'm certainly no anime expert, as I tend to be very picky about what I watch and won't invest my time into a show unless I feel fairly confident that I'm going to really get something out of it. So, after reading countless rave reviews of Code Geass, I finally decided that I had to see what all the hoopla was about. It's worth noting that Death Note is my favorite anime--hell, possibly my favorite show period--of all time. It's a show that I hold dear. Naturally, I had to check out the show that constantly gets compared to my beloved Death Note, and while I doubted from the start that I would enjoy it on the same level, I had very high hopes that CG would at least take me on a riveting and stimulating ride. 
 
Boy, was I wrong. Look--I tend to go along with the notion that things don't get extremely popular unless there's a good reason, whether that thing suits my personal tastes or not. But now, after struggling through sixteen episodes of this show, I can honestly say that I have no idea how this show became at all popular in the first place, much less considered a rival to Death Note. That is, in my personal opinion, a complete insult to DN. I could go on for hours about the reasons why that is, but I'll sum it all up with this: the beauty of DN is in its subtlety, and how rooted in reality the concepts and events are despite the supernatural themes of it all. CG, on the other hand, wouldn't know subtlety if it ran up and spat in its face. From the first episode, the series comes off as spastic, frantic, and downright desperate to convince you that you're being entertained. While DN has a clear point and sticks to it; CG has no point. There; I've addressed the whole DN/CG comparison. Moving on. 
 
This is the first show that I have ever made it past the second episode of and then didn't complete. How did that happen? By me clinging to the hope that the series would make a turn-around at some point and start impressing me, proving me that my first impressions had been wrong. What I got instead was a slow, steady spiral into absurdity that eventually became so unbearable that I had to abandon a series for the first time. Since spoilers are discouraged, I'll instead have a list at the bottom detailing the worst examples from my list of ridiculous, inexplicable, plot-holey moments that I managed to get through. I'll say this though, since it shouldn't count as a spoiler: the thing that finally broke me was the clapping guy. I almost turned off my Xbox after his first episode, but I was willing to press onward since it looked like his role had been concluded. When he turned up again, I just couldn't handle any more. Ironically, this guy had one of the more interesting backstories, and his was a premise that I think, in different hands, could've become something pretty compelling. It's a bad sign when the most obnoxious character in the whole show is also the only one that manages to pique my interest even 1%. The completionist in me wanted to know how the story ended (or didn't, as the case turned out to be) so I read the summaries of the remaining episodes, half hoping that I would read something mind-blowing that would make me kick myself for not sticking with it. I didn't. It should go without saying that I will not be watching the second season. 
 
Anyway, I won't get too deep into a discussion of the art, soundtrack, etc. since it's been echoed a million times on this site already. All I'll say is that the female characters looked totally generic, and the two leading males, Lelouch and Suzaku, were shameless Gary Stus. It's no coincidence that the last episode I watched included Suzaku turning into a Spiderman-Flash chimera and outrunning/round-housing a machine gun. Aye-yay-yay. To the art's credit, Lelouch was very, very cute, and being able to stare at him may have subconsciously been what carried me (partially) through the series. 
 
I'll conclude with my list of ridiculousness, but I want to point something out, too. My extremely harsh review of CG may make me seem like the type that simply doesn't think any anime is good enough, but that's not true. I'm usually not that tough of a critic, and I tend to give cut shows a lot of slack. All of my favorite series have their flaws, even the ones I give 10s. I suppose the difference is that those other series managed to entertain me and get into my heart and/or soul and/or mind despite their shortcomings. CG, on the other hand, tried my patience and fortitude like no other series I've ever seen. To the millions who loved it and got a lot out of it, I'm glad for you, but I really can't understand it. To each their own, I suppose. 
 
****SPOILER ALERT**** 
 
Where did Lelouch get that helmet? Did he buy it? Are the high-tech customized villain gear stores in this alternate reality, ones that can link with your brain and reveal only your left eye whenever you will it so? Some may consider this nit-picking, but these sort of things bother me, especially in series that try to be somewhat realisitic. 
 
The whole resolution to Lelouch and Shirley's...whatever it was. So I'm supposed to buy that all of their friends, not to mention the entire school, are cool with playing along with Shirley not recognizing him and knowing nothing about him? For like, ever? I would love for someone to look me dead in the eye and tell me with a straight face that that whole plotline wasn't completely idiotic. 
 
In the same vein, the fact that no one ever tried to pin Lelouch down about his suspicious behavior, as well as how conveniently MIA he was each and every time something big with the Black Knights happened, really bothered me. Coupled with the fact that Zero has his exact height, build, and practically the same voice, and you've got yourself a supporting cast that's dumb as rocks in order to protect the ""story"" from falling apart after episode 4. 
 
There are other little things I could get into, but it would quickly become redundant, and this review has gotten too long already. Perhaps shockingly, however, I will answer ""yes"" to the ""would you recommend this"" question, with one stipulation. I would recommend this to someone who has never seen any other anime before, so that I could then show them some decent series and be able to use CG as a baseline. As in, ""see how great that was? SO much better and more sensible than how they did it in Code Geass.""

    This is THE anime to go to if you're into the action-genre! When shit started spinning and stuff, damn.  
 
Before you watch this, bring in some popcorn, and turn of the light because you want the best viewing experience for this thrilling, actionpacked adventure from 1931! It will leave you with a sickness causing you to see, taste, and feel the color purple for the next three days (if it lasts longer, contact a doctor).

    ''The legend ends, and history begins...'' 
Would it be possible for an anime series to be extremely coherent, with a broad range of relevant characters, without getting contradictory in its more advanced stage and maintain its quality for over than 100 episodes? Most anime series disagree...but not Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Being the huge anime it is, this 110 episode OVA series could well have turned into a tremendous dissapointment if it had the bad handling for that. Being from a less known studio and to have been released for over than 9 years would also help LotGH be an example for that. Fortunately for anime it wasn't. 
 
Story - 9 
 
From its start, the story depicts a small portion of the long fought war between two huge intergalactic superpowers: the democratic republic of the Free Planets Alliance and the monarchic Galactic Empire; while the small planet of Phezzan, an economic superpower, notes the disputes of those two.  
 
A premise like this could easily get broken by simply being biased towards one of the side, leaving one of them in the good side while the other is at the bad side, making the morality bar strictly black and white.However, during its run-time, there's never any evidence of there ever being a bias approach towards a specific side. Each of them are depicted as having their own virtues and flaws, advantages and disadvantages, and both show how this war impacts one another. Both suffer  important losses during the huge length of the series.  
 
Being the multi-layered story it is, LotGH also presents how the economic power of Phezzan can affects both forces. The first quarter of the series is actually focusing not only on how the interactions between these foreign groups work, but also how their people act inside of each power. For example, while FPA claims to be a righteous democracy, it actually suffers from political corruption. Similarly to FPA, the Galactic Empire also holds its fare share of corrupt nobles, rising in power because of their connections and money. Whereas Phezzan, while trying to keep an image of a just economical power, its Leader shows clear desire to pull the strings behind the war for his financial advantage while, behind the shadows, worshiping the Terraism religion, consisting majorly of mindless lunatics who worship the now long gone planet Earth as the origin of all life, easily doing any task their religious leaders order them to, being it pragmatically violent or not. 
 
There is an excellent equilibrium of virtues and flaws on each side for the morality bar to be as gray as possible. There is always some kind of foreshadowing before a happening that would otherwise feel convinient. Every action has a consequence, even if it had to be done for the well being of millions while taking the lives of thousands, not only the one who will have to react to it but also the one who suffered from it. Every action is taken seriously and there is always thinking about its consequences, unless the character doing it has backdrop excusing his possible bad handling.  
 
There can be some arguing that LotGH, however, is unable to portray his seriousness in some of his aspects and ends up becoming pretentious. But here I am to excuse some of the frequently used arguments against LotGH: 
 *“Why are people concerned about there being politicians supporting war and patriotism while they themselves won’t go to war, even though there has to be someone dealing with services while soldiers are away?”* Simple. People from every corner of the world, from every warfare period in recent years, have always given some blame to politicians for not participating in the fights they promote. They’re lacking reasoning of course, but it is clear that LotGH just used those moments to portray some realism in such situations. 
 
*“Medieval fights in space? Cheap excuse for copying Star Wars lightsaber action”* It is excused in series that while in combat there is a special type of gas-like substance, the Zephyr particles, which in contact to any type of heat, enters in instantaneous combustion. As a solution, in order to take over another battleship or space where the substance is applied, they use traditional battle equipment. 
 
*“Naval strategies in space?”* There is no up or down in space. They wouldn’t be able to fight properly while using 3D battle strategies without losing their sense of direction and actual positioning. 
 
*“There are few geniuses in this series! Most of the victories are achieved by outsmarting dumb people!”* Firstly, there aren’t only military geniuses fighting in wars. Secondly, this goes to show that there are dumb people in positions they don’t deserve, for the already said reasons. If you pay enough attention it becomes clear that, whenever real war geniuses are fighting, the decisions and strategies shown become far more complex and tend to follow a reasoning that will find an opening that the opposition won’t be waiting for. 
 
*“This looks like a documentary. I get it! War is bad!”* There are far more subtle messages than just saying that war is bad. Disregarding other themes, the series always tries to portray the reasoning behind it and is not always against it. Of course the show is clearly against war and every type of warfare is seen in a rather depressing than cool way but LotGH also showed other POV. 
 
*“One side started getting ahead in the war! The show it being biased!”* There were gradually and rationally appearing far more advantages in one side rather than the other. Of course that side had to start gaining terrain instead of the other. It is far more plausible to do that instead of keeping a forced balance. 
 
You might be questioning yourself by now, that after so much arguing and defending the series as a Masterpiece, why doesn’t it get the perfect score? Well as any type of entertainment work in existence LotGH does have its problems. However small they may be, they truly affect the anime in a negative way. Most of the problems of the series stand out from its pacing and exposition. The major problem with these is that they clearly end up messing with each other and sometimes ruin the experience. It is really easy for an episode to become unamusing just because the first 3 minutes of it were completely infodumped by the narrator. Now I may have made it seem horrible but to be honest without this type of exposition, the series would be 3 times bigger and 1/3 would be complete set-up episodes ruining the experience in a much bigger level. For the runtime the episodes have, for being able to use as much as 3 for episodes of complete infodumping is a complete win, as some series tend to do the same...only 10 times worse. LotGH uses infodumps on usually actions that happened with little conflict and ended up being of little importance, relatively to what is going to happen in the entire episode, however, to keep it realistic, they had to happen. That's the only reason I can find to excuse the infodumps. 
 
Character - 10 
 
Not only is Legend of the Galactic Heroes humongous in plot, but also in the quantity of characters it presents. To such a quantity of characters, it could easily happen what happens to shows like DRRR!!, where most of the cast is almost completely disregarded of any characterization or relevance. LotGH on the other hand is able to present 50+ characters, all having relevance in the plot and having their fare share of characterization and chaacter development. And don't come at me saying that DRRR!! had less screentime for that, because all the characterization given for every early character in the series in done within the first 15 or so episodes without leaving plot progression left in the corner. As there are so many characters worth of mentioning in the series and as I might as well be writing a book about all of them right now, I will focus my attention to 3 of them who I think that deserve to be mentioned. 
 
Yang Wen-li may as well be elected as world president. A clumsy guy who just wanted to study history as kid but because of economical problems ended up entering the army in order to have his studies paid. The poor guy would then be acknowledge as a military genius and levels up in rank quite fast. Not because he chose to however. He limited himself to use strategies he ended up studying as, unfortunately, most of human history is full of warfare. Finding himself in such an high position he at least tries to recommend his superiors plans that without fail will succeed even tho they don't listen to him. 
Reinhard von Musel was a poor noblesmen son that at an early age had the light of his life, his sister Annerose von Musel, taken from him by the Kaiser.  
 
Reinhard then vowed to, one day, seize the entire universe by his hands so that he won't ever be an impacable powerless lad again. Siegfried Kircheis is Reinhards best friend in the entire universe and promised Annerose that he would protect him no matter what happened. Kircheis could easily be mistaken as a shadow of Reinhard, his right-arm or even just his advisor who calls him up whenever his flaws make him choose the wrong path or act. He sometimes even feels overwhelmed by Reinhard. He really is, however, looked upon by Reinhard as a guardian who he himself tends to follow whenever he feels unease. Try picturing this level of characterization into 20 more characters and try to explain it all lol. Throughout this epic all these characters will learn with their eventual mistakes, mature or sometimes destroy themselves because of the events that take place in their endangered lives.  
 
Not so fortunately tho, all this characterization is mostly used on the most relevant characters, as early opponents to Reinhard and Yang tend to rather be the one-dimensional corrupt bastards that can be seen in your usual Sunday cartoon. But as these are so few characters in a range of over 50+ well executed characters, it can easily be overlooked. This also happens for Terraism lunatics, but as the creators were trying to pass a message through that, it is completely excused. 
 
Art & Animation - 8 
 
Although dated, for their time the art and animation of the series was pretty well executed and stand out from most anime as they actually tend to get better over time, unlike most anime out there. There are well drawn scenarios as well as memorable character figures. The only problem I can find was how they diddn't use any type of simbolism to distinguish rank between FPA soldiers, even though they sacrificed this for realism. The character designs were very well chosen as they had to transmit a sense of realism and not the usual exagerated anime tropes. Their hair color was within the spectre of realistic hair colors as well as their body porpotions. 
 
Sound - 10 
 
The soundtrack however can be said to be the most well chosen aspect within the presentation of the series. Ageless classical music being played during the course of the series, really merges with the whole aesthetic of the series and I can no further explain how much I loved it. The OPs were mostly decent but  the 3rd one ""Sea of Stars"" can be said to be one of the most enjoyable OPs evr done. Go watch to it. The golden trophy however goes for every ED this show had. They didnt create simple melancholic EDs. They created the most endearing pieces of audiovisual I have experienced in the ED category. 
 
Overall - (9.5) 10  
 
LotGH does have problems, but they become meaningless near the excelent characters and plot that explores its military and political themes perfectly, while making outstanding parallels between military and politics, often depicted as some of humanity's most important moments.

    okay so i was looking for masterpieces on MAL for about a week and god damn i am lucky to find this gem, Inferno Cop. Trigger can really do no wrong and here is a review on their best work they will ever make. (fuk u Kill La Kill) 
 
story: 
 
i don't remember and i don't care. i finished the series an hour ago. inferno cop is the plot. just, inferno cop. 
 
art: 
 
garbage but genius animation. totally fits the parody vibe well. the characters stuck with me because the still shots were consistent. 
 
sound: 
 
i watched subbed so i guess thats cool idk. music fits for the short episodes and the ending is god since there is no opening. yes i meant god. 
 
character: 
 
inferno cop is that fucking dude who will swear not as much as me but will still swear. side characters, most notably mecha cop, are great in their own right. 
 
enjoyment: 
 
nothing finer than this anime. wish it were 200 minute episodes rather than 2 minute episodes. and 1300 episodes rather than 13. great show to sit down and blow through while laughing your ass off. unironically love this show. 
 
recommendation: 
 
you're a fucking retard if you read this and won't check it out for yourself trust me this show is greatness and is anime's final form. move over Neo Yokio, we have a fucking winner.

    Disclaimer:  
1/ This show is promotional material for the lite novel. 
2/ This show is more political commentary than typical anime. 
Because it is from a lite novel, it suffers from all the typical lite novel tropes: OP loner protagonist, female harem, high school. 
 
Now then why is this show more commentary than anime tv series? Because if you watch this show for above the surface aspects such as engaging characters, gripping plot, fantastic visuals, this show will not be for you (reflected by how polarizing reviews are) 
 
For this show, its minimalist characterization is its strength (teasing you at the possible twisted personalities these individuals hide). 
""Why should I care? I don't feel connected to any of these characters."" 
 
This is because the characters that the show spend time characterizing are generic, deliberately so. In this high school world the show portray (An anarcho-capitalist, objectivist, wet dream) with class A-D with D being the worst class, it is intentionally implied that straight forward, generic, honest people do not succeed in this type of environment.  
 
What this show then do is try to get viewers to analyze this argument philosophically; with several overt attempts at doing so such as semi pretentious quotes usually in a foreign language for both the intro and quote of the episode serving as title of the episode. 
 
In that sense, this show is much akin to Kakeguri but instead of over the top orgasmic hyperbolic interpretation, this show’s strongest draw is mystery and portrayal of political philosophy such as objectivism (think Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrug), libertarianism, capitalism, political bipartisanship, etc. from the point of view of an apathetic elite protagonist, Ayanokouji, who is shown and implied to have overwhelming ability but cares not for the world, nihilistically so, around him with his foil being main girl Horikita and side girl Kushida. 
 
With the shows unconventional take on the anime formula, as well as the polarizing nature of the subject as reflected by how polarizing reviews are, this show is definitely not for everyone. Some messages will definitely fly over people’s heads.  
 
Furthermore as a show, this is definitely paid promotion for the lite novel which serves as both the show’s greatest strength and weakness. On one hand it is way too short to examine the subplots (that the show teases plenty of) as well as the theme. On the other hand, due to how short it is, they can justify leaving room for these subtleties for the inquisitive questioning mind.  
 
In general, I think this show did its job promoting enough interest in the lite novel (and some of the underlying philosophies being examined) but it clearly will have very niche interest. If you enjoy contemplating what ifs, this show is for you. 7.5

    As someone who will defend the Sonic series quite a bit, I must say this is one of the WORST pieces of media I've ever seen.  
 
It has a story that makes no sense and characters that make even less sense. No one has any logic to how they act. Sonic is extremely out of character. Avoid this OVA. Don't even watch it out of curiosity. 
 
I was in shock after watching this abomination that the localizers tried to pass off as a ""movie"". It's not a movie. It's less than an hour long, and perhaps that's for the best, because I hated every second of this trash. 
 
Watch Sonic Boom instead.

    Hate watching those anime that drag on for too long with boring storylines?  Then try School Rumble, each episode is totally random, even though it does try to follow a main storyline.   
 
As the story goes on, it becomes more and more hilarious!  I wished my high school was as fun as this.  It portrays as guys being very pathetic and always going after girls, this makes them very funny to watch!  The jokes are very humorous; some is just silly. 
 
The animation is very beautiful, although it has more beautiful girls and the boys are all very weird.  The animals drawn are very cute and the main character is such a klutz, her face turns fat all the time. 
 
The background sounds are funny, adds comedy to the scene.  The soundtrack is just as good, the music is very soothing.  The voice characters are just funny and the voices are exaggerated very much, which give the impression that the character is very dumb. 
 
The characters are very distinct; I get confused sometimes because there are many characters and a lot of names to remember.  I only remember Harima Kenji because the English version of this name is Harry McKenzie.  But his character was the funniest out of all the boys in the class, he is supposed to be a delinquent but then turns all soft and lovey dovey, and the girl he falls for is an average looking slow girl, which makes it all so much funnier because he is dumb as well. 
 
This is very enjoyable if you like to watch comedy genres, and don't mind the occasional half naked scenes.  There were many scenes where I was cracking up; this anime has to be the funniest I’ve seen and the most random. 
 
Highly recommended for boys more than girls because it has a lot of big breasts involved.  It’s just too damn funny!

    It's about a notebook called as Death Note. If u write a person's name when you think that person to this notebook, they shall die in 40 seconds by a heart attack. You can change the death time or death style. 
 
Head character Yagami Light is smartess student in him school. One day after school, he finds a Death Note in school garden. He thinks it is a joke but he takes the notebook. He sees the power of the book and decide to change world but same time he have to fight againts a detective called as L 
 
Story isn't extraordinary but style of storytelling is very good. 
We see the mindwar between the L and Light during anime. 
<IT MAY BE SPOILER> 
In last episodes, new characters add in story and one of this characters is a disgusting copy of L. 
For this i broke 2 points from character 
<END OF SPOILER> 
I dont think i could talk about music. These are masterpieces. 
 
I gave this score because of the reason im said in spoiler side.

    A greatly recommended anime by many, very nice action scenes going on, not really surprising having that director, but feels very lacking in story. 
 
Have you seen before a carefree protagonist who ends up being friend with a serious and quiet person and they have another friend that is ok but can terrify them when gets mad? And then you have those super original plots like the montrous guy that actually had a gentle heart, the thief that just wanted to buy his mothers medicine (sometimes this one appears just trying to feed his orphan brothers), the assassin that was being black mailed but wasn't a bad person... it's hardly a shounen 'cause it lacks an enemy development, obstacles and stronger foes they have to overcome, the story is pretty casual, but it's not all comedy oriented also, the unique thing they develop is the hip-hop culture things they add to Edo Japan, but the only good stories are the ones that were divided in two parts. 
 
Overall the story is good but nothing special, same thing for the characters, but it have a great direction and great action scenes, very good art and animation and also very good sound track.

    The Director of this anime needs to be fired. They rushed the first episode for no reason ruining the pacing of it. The CGI will make your eyes bleed. So bad for such a great Manga. Completely ruined it. Do not watch the anime! Read the Manga or The Light Novel instead! 
 
The story is rated 1 due to shitty directing, they fucked it all up. 
 
The art is rated 1 because of the cursed CGI and bright colors with no good shadowing in dark areas. 
 
The sound is Rated one, too much quiet awkward silence in scenes.  
 
Character is Rated 1 because how they paced the story makes him seem like an edgelord who fell down a hole for a little bit and became Tokyo Ghoul 2.0 
 
Enjoyment is  a 1, really saddened and disappointed how the anime turned out. Needs a worse rating. 
 
Overall its 1. Complete dogshit anime, but I highly advise to read the Source material.

    Code Geass is a complex anime about an anti-hero, Lelouch. His intelligence is beyond compare, and he hopes to take over a country he is actually a prince of, Britannia. It's essentially about him starting a terrorist organization with a group of Japanese (or Elevens, as the Britannians call them). He goes by the name Zero, wearing a mask and cloak to shield his identity. Lelouch is actually a student--vice president of the student council at his school (lots of adventures come out of that, too). 
 
We last left off in the first season with him being almost overthrown by the people he was fighting to conquer. 
 
Code Geass R2 starts off confusing--new faces, old faces you'd never expect to see again--but soon picks up. There's only three episodes released so far, but it looks promising. The art is as lovely as ever, with loads of detail and amazing character designs by the reowned manga group, CLAMP. 
 
It really is a great series--nice action, slick designs...What more could you ask for? :)

    I've read a lot f reviews and nobody has fully grasped the concept of what √A is and was, and it's incredibly upsetting that the viewers aren't up to par with the intelligence of this telling. 
 
Nothing about the main story actually changed and I think this is what was eye opening if one takes a closer look. In comparison to the manga our main character was less absent from our eyes, to a simpleton this is disheartening. To  those who watched it, and I mean actually watched it they'd find that √A was the other side to the same coin. 
 
The manga focused on Kaneki doing his own thing in the background of the actual story concerning the war between Aogiri Tree and CCG. Nothing he did changed the outcome of that battle, and in √A it remained the same. I loved seeing what happened behind the scenes of the manga in the anime and it answered a lot of questions. The animation was flawless and the creator who worked with the staff to tell his original idea for the series did an excellent job of sliding in the answers to our questions of the first series of the manga, with more to come. 
 
As I put in my original blog post to those that argue with logic? The story hasn't changed at all, Kaneki still suffers. No matter what path he chooses he winds up in the same place, facing the same obstacles, losing the same people. 
 
Wonderful story, much better character development for everybody all around since Kaneki didn't change at all even when he was the centric focus. Can't wait for more works.

    SPOILERS AHEAD 
 
I feel like most people give this show too much shit for the 'bad' ending and the whole social anxiety thing. I didn't mind the ending. It would be kind of wishful thinking if Machi were to suddenly overcome her social anxiety in the end, since nothing indicated that her condition improved. On the contrary: every experience that she had in the city (or in front of a crowd of people she didn't know) ended quite negatively. 
 
I also think that Machi's negative character developement, as I read someone describe it, is realistic due to what I mentioned above. As I myself suffer from anxiety and panic attacks during stressful social events I really understand why Machi doesn't want to go to the city anymore. 
 
I do somewhat agree with everyone's consensus on Natsu. He is a shitty person, but I do not find him a bad written character. He wants Machi to succeed in life and tries to teach her about the modern way of living and to make her overcome her social anxiety (albeit a bit forcefully). However, it is understandable that he wants Machi to stay in the village with him. We could see in a few flashback scenes that he has been very close to Machi since they were little and he doesn't want to lose her. So in the end, he chooses the selfish thing to do and enables Machi's hikkikomori tendency. Is he a douchebag? Yes. But is it bad writing on the creator's end? IMO, no. 
 
This show has been a pretty wild ride. It started off as a generic SOL cute girls doing cute things moe moe anime, but as it progresses it becomes more of a Welcome to the NHK/Watamote mix. I honestly would have dropped it if it stayed on the moe side, since it doesn't appeal to me. But because it adresses a real thing like social anxiety, which is a very rare thing in anime, and because it ends without any asspulls (Machi suddenly magically overcame her anxiety!) I rate this show a solid 8/10.

    As a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion, I can say from an objective point of view that the series does have flaws. Multiple times throughout the series, I found myself dissapointed that things could have been greatly improved upon to make the series perfect. Unfortunately, though the series is great, it isn't perfect. 
 
End of Evangelion is. The series is known for its psychological overtones, but it had a tendency to shove them down your throat at times. End of Evangelion, however, leaves them subtle, yet obvious enough to notice and interpret. The most important part, in my opinion, is how End of Evangelion is far, far darker than the series. The series is naturally bleak and depressing, but it seemed too tame when compared to the story it was telling. Violence and sexual interaction were slim in the series despite all of them integral to the story being told. End of Evangelion fixes this and delivers scenes truly fitting the presented story. 
 
If you were disappointed with episodes 25 and 26 then look no further. This movie will leave you pleased with the series and even more so with the movie itself.

    This beautifully complex anime, might just come off as too overwhelming for some in the beginning, since Time Travel slaps our faces from the get-go not to mention the notable difficulty in keeping up with the main character's professionalist ego, yet it ultimately settles on cementing a relationship of love so beautiful, and with such perfect and made-for-each-other individuals ,that it seems to transcend time as well as our expectations, and steals away the whole show and our hearts ,forming a bond with these two that just leaves us wanting to see more. 
A beautiful tale of finding love across time. 
Trust me. You will love Makise Kurisu and Rintarou Okabe

    Beastars, a show that transcends the logic of nature in the animal kingdom. From a world where social anxiety is the common norm and characters are portrayed as non-humans, we have ourselves a show that is about more than just animals. Living in this time era and adapting like survival of the fittest, Beastars embodies a story of a beast who strives to be who he is but faces against his personal demons in an imperfect world. 
 
Paru Itagaki’s manga identifies itself as a drama and sell it in a complex labyrinth of feelings. Someone such as Legosi adapts a reflective personality, where he spends his time examining himself more than others. It’s a question we the viewers should ask ourselves: can carnivores co-exist in a society with herbivores? The law of nature says otherwise as herbivores are hunted by carnivores. If you go to a zoo and see a lion, tiger, or some carnivore staring at you. Chances are, they are hungry and want to be fed. Living in cages and trapped, robbed of freedom, and deprived of hunting is how animals are treated at the zoo. But in Beastars, everyone is free, at least those who haven’t committed lawful deeds. So, how can carnivores and herbivores exist together without one species wiping out the other? 
 
The answer isn’t simple and that’s what makes Beastars an intriguing specimen. When watching Beastars, it feels as if the show is testing the audience, to see how we examine the character and if we are right or wrong. In the beginning, we meet Legosi, the gray wolf with a rather reserved personality. Despite being a carnivore, you don’t see him as a ferocious beast and in fact, quite the opposite. Being a fan of tragic stories ironically puts him into a position where he faces against drama of his own. After making acquaintance with Haru, a third year rabbit and member of the Cherryton gardening club, the duo builds a complex relationship. It’s the type of character pair you’d least expected similar to Beauty and the Beast. Legosi’s relationship with Haru is the antithesis of a carnivore as he spends his time building a connection with her. He doesn’t see Haru as a prey but rather as a companion, someone he can relate to because both of them share their loneliness. It makes you almost feel sorry for them because part of society has ostracized the pair. Haru’s a scapegoat for this example. When bullied by her peers, Haru treats it as a normal day routine and it’s sad to see how real it is. Bullying can lead to psychological problems with Haru being a victim. It doesn’t take a genius to see how Haru just wants others to accept her and she wants to do whatever it takes, no matter the risk. Even if it means having sex. 
 
It’s a cruel society, isn’t it? Well, maybe not for everyone. When you’re someone like Louis, the third year deer student with a mountain of pride, there’s not much to worry about. And because Beastars loves to play around with its drama, Louis becomes part of this great machine. Now you’re probably asking yourself the question, what exactly is a Beastar? In pure definition, it’s a rank accepted by the anthropomorphic society as a great individual. Think of them as a leader of a great nation, student council president, or important member of society. This type of individual is far from either Legosi or Haru’s reach but the show does push its effort for certain characters such as Louis to become one. Sadly, this anime is only 12 episodes long so the road is still a long way ahead. On the other hand, watching characters develop complex feelings towards one another is instrumental to the show’s success. Like teenagers growing up, characters experience livelihood and what they depend on to be in their society. Do Haru and Legosi depend on each other to survive? Does Louis depend on his social class to become a Beastar? Or even someone like Juno, can she depend on herself to build a loving relationship with someone like Legosi? These are some of the complex questions in the show and the answer may be ambiguous. Back to what I mentioned before, Beastars feels as if the anime is testing us to understand the characters. This isn’t some Zootopia where every day in sunshine and joy. Beastars carries a dark tone of storytelling clouded with complex feelings between characters. Actions has consequences. The animal world is imperfect. And this show opens up the nature of animals at its darkest of hours. 
 
As someone who has read the manga, expectations from this adaptation was high with its unique artwork. The manga is drawn with a simple yet very effective way of art style that depicts characters’ animalistic natures without being too real or fake. It’s most noticeable when characters’ animal instinct kicks in and feelings sometimes overtake their personalities, such as the case of Legosi. Other times, it’s drawn with fragile context such as the case of the dwarf sized rabbit Haru. Society in Beastars is mostly not different from our own with established schools, residence, and modern houses. It’s not the type of nature where we see their society being completely free. Action has consequences like I said before, and there are rules to obey. Still, I want to throw this out there right now that if you plan to watch Beastars, be aware of its mature content. The law of nature has very little limits when animals behave like animals. Bloodshed, torture, and abuse is not an uncommon sight. Haru is a testament of fragileness as she is smaller than most characters. And putting her into this society shows how vulnerable rabbits can be. 
 
The most unlikely of pairs, a rabbit and a gray wolf having complex thoughts with one and the other. Who would of thought? Beastars seemingly makes the impossible a reality, a society where carnivores aren’t just free to fill their appetite. Legosi’s predatory instincts tests the limits of how much a carnivore can resist themselves and while it’s not always easy, he gives us an insider look at their psyche. Watching Beastars is more than just about a drama story of Beauty and the Beast but as a way of showing how cruel the real world can really be.

    Well let's talk about this series as it has already finished I can say in a calm way, in my opinion the series was quite good, entertaining, exciting, painful, curious, embarrassed in a point of view of society in the coldest way, where we see the dark side of the coin in a world where peace enjoys, with our protagonist. 
 
The studio treated the series very well in animation, history, soundtrack, development, everything was well directed in a calm way and probably not abusing. It treats in a perfect way the world view of the prota and as it begins to see the good side of life, I would not call it the series of the year nor the best anime unlike the exaggeration of boku no hero, this series leaves you to reflect on the current reality. 
 
If I would recommend it? 
It would depend if you like the shonen not exaggerated as boku no hero or shingeki this series would be perfect. Do not bore is excitingly hot and without hesitation gives a break for a change. 
 
no more thanks!

    Outbreak Company is about your typical hikki getting sent to an alternate universe to help Japan spread otaku culture there. It's a fairly balanced mixture of comedy, romance and drama. 
 
As with many animes of this nature, the plot is fairly sluggish for the first 75% of the season, then the pace rapidly picks up towards the end as the writers cram all the progression into the final episodes. The plot isn't necessarily important for an anime of this nature but I think it could have been managed a bit better. 
 
The character design was pretty standard for a fantasy setting. Nothing particularly memorable but nothing i'd consider awful. The werewolf girl was cute. 
 
The comedy is pretty solid and I give the writers full marks for their comedic style. I think if they had focused more on putting a bit more comedy in, the series would have greatly benefitted. The romance and drama is all pretty standard, nothing noteworthy happens in these departments. 
 
There is a bit of lewdness here and there but it's all censored and not really all that frequent. 
 
The art style is fine, the music and sound effects are also fine. 
 
If you want a comedic series with a bit of romance and drama on the side, you can't go wrong with Outbreak Company. While I don't think it is one of the best animes in this genre, I still think it does a great job with its comedic writing. I give it a solid 7.

    Story: i mean there really isnt a story to this at all its basically takagi teasing Nishikata and he tries to tease her back or that before the Day starts he tries to tease Takagi before she even tries to to tease that's pretty much the story in a nutshell. 
 
Art: the art is really good from the character design to the over all feel of the anime it is really good. 
 
Sound: the Op is pretty decent but nothing really good as for the ED they use ALOT of Ed for it some are decent while others are not so good as for the Va's i watched the dub but they were easily good for the anime. 
 
Characters: Nishikata is the only male lead in the anime and is the bunt of when it comes to takagi and her teasing of him he is a really nice and just a good dude overall who tries to get back at takagi but fails a lot at it. Takagi is the only female lead and is the one who is always Nishikata in always than one when it comes to said teasing she is nice and again straight forward when it comes to teasing Nishikata. (even though you might think id review the 3 other girls in the anime i wont i just kinda felt like they were there when they didn't need to be i guess they had there own manga i guess set in the same spot the 2 but yeah i wont review them even though one might think i would). 
 
Enjoyment: What i liked: i mean i loved this anime for sure from just Takagi and Nishikata and there certain interaction's with each other to the art and also the other characters being really well done to the comedy actually being really well funny and what not it was a really good anime for sure also the bits of romance as well a good here. What i didn't like: i guess this would be more for people that yes this anime CAN get repetitive and old after while with all the teasing between the 2 but i thought it was always good this is just here for some people who might not like the repetitiveness otherwise i would say yeah at sometimes it was repetitive but i still enjoyed myself here. 
 
Overall: id give this a 8.5 (would give it a 9 but maybe you could kinda understand why i wouldn't) ill admit the only thing i didn't like was yes it was kinda repetitive for me but just the interaction between Takagi and also Nishitaka with and also the fact that i just really loved the comedy as well as the teasing going on and such was really well done here i would recommend this anime to anyone.

    Short review. A bit flame like. 
This is one of those animes which I had first read the manga then ventured seeing the anime. And, also, one of those few that I simply wanted to scream.... not of joy but of despair!  
The story starts to follow the main manga plot, some small changes here and there, but mostly understandable... But when it came to the end...That's when all hell brakes loose! A real disappointment. IF you've read the manga, please don't waist your time seeing the last few episodes.  
 
The only good thing must have been the opening music, a real treat.

    Full Metal Alchemist was an amazingly original take on an older dead science, and a very good example of where and idea can be taken and maximized into a true epic. With a compelling story that has a depth that can be enjoyable for most viewers I would put it on the essentials list, and in the genre of shonen that is generally riddled with crap this stands out amazingly.

    Sailor moon, no matter what version has always been one of my favourites and I doubt even as I get older that I'll ever get tired of it. This version of the anime has been insane! I don't think there was one episode where I didn't feel emotional kicks right into the feels, everything about it was amazing and so far I think it's my favourite out of the ""crystal"" series.  
 
The portrayal of all the characters introduced in this season seemed to be spot on and right to the story, as well as the updated artwork made it more enjoyable to watch.  
 
All in all I don't think I have really anything bad to say about this season aside from the fact I'm truly sad that now we have to wait for the next instalment of the story.

Scif.i has a tendency  of involving time warps and such but i never imagined a shows plot could be as equally warped! They take random things and throw it into the plot. Sometimes the cut to scenes of people talking but is unclear if theses are more random people or the same couple that keeps taking because they never focus on the characters. Instead the camera focuses on the legs, shows them in dark light, yadada.  
 
Sound, was a joke. Using the same couple i mentioned the voices which are supposed to be of two individuals to me came from one. Also, from what could be seen of the hidden couple they were dressed as female so why a male voice?  
 
I could go on and on but what would be the point. It won't provide me with answers just more questions. 
 
As far as art is concerned this is mostly a black and white flick. 
 
I recommend skipping this.

!!Since there’s only a short gap between S1 and S2 of Black Lagoon, I am going to be reviewing both seasons here so Warning beforehand for any Accidental Spoilers!! 
 
 
‘Black Lagoon’ captured my attention from Revy on the poster to good word of mouth. Not knowing what to make of the title or the poster, I was very surprised at what this anime turned out to be. Often criticized for copying ‘Cowboy Bebop’, I was a little concerned at first but this anime distinguishes itself with its world building and characters. Set to a dark yet realistic, cruel, cold, violent and brutal crime infested town that perfectly captures the last place you want to be in this R-rated world. This anime superbly holds nothing back and you get a load of hot girls wielding big guns and firing at everything and everyone! In fact, this anime is all about tits, ass, guns, explosions, cursing and badass chicks! You start with Okajima, leading a boring life who then gets kidnapped by the Lagoon company on a business trip. Upon realizing he’s been abandoned by his own company, he decides to join this group of renegades and gets the nickname ‘Rock’. Even though the anime lacks in story and the plot is pretty much the group doing different missions, it never bothers anyone since what you get is very entertaining to watch! This has some of the best Action scenes, so good that you can’t take your eyes off them! I mean why would I care about Story when I can get Revy killing a bunch of Nazi’s on a ship! The anime also doesn’t shy away from clichés like generic character traits or plot armour for the main characters during battle but it doesn’t matter! ‘Black Lagoon’ totally owns it by delivering non-stop Awesome Action and helps you forget the unrealism of it all. 
 
This is also one of those rare shows where the Female characters not only KICK ASS but completely steal the show! You get a little bit of everything from the characters, with the weak MC who later grow balls to a Computer Geek, Samurai, Mafia, Cartels, Russians, Nazis, Crazy maids and nuns! I had a lot of fun with most of the characters but the Stand out is Revy by a large margin. This foul mouthed, gun blazing, sexy yet deadly Chinese version of Lara Croft is the most interesting character on the show. She’s the kind of woman who will kill anyone that gets in her way and then later drink at a bar as if nothing happened! Her use of the word ‘F***’ was always fun to hear and her ‘No Shit Given’ attitude propels her to the top of many people’s list of Badass female characters. Revy also comes across very sexy regardless of displaying no forms of seductiveness, I mean she rarely shows any sort of attraction to anyone! But those poses she takes while shooting just makes her unbelievably attractive and I for one couldn’t get her out of my head for a while! She’s also involved in a lively relationship with Rock that’s never clearly defined yet both display great chemistry with one another. In fact, Rock becomes more interesting after his interactions with Revy cause otherwise he’s the one who holds back, being the one with morals and integrity. He’s heavily overshadowed by Revy but I enjoyed him a lot too cause he showed tons of resilience for an amateur and even stared down the badass Revy by speaking his mind. Even under the threat of a gun, he was able to hold his ground. We even later see him starting to fit in with the rest of the group which was also to my liking. There are so many great supporting characters here so it’s hard to pick a favourite! You get the nuns from the church, Eda stands out due to her relationship with Revy. Then you have the freaking female terminator maid Roberta who’s insanely good with killing and tracking! Balalaika was another stand out female character, with her connections to the Russian military and the cold and smart demeanour with which she ran the place. She and her crew are responsible for some cool action scenes and I thoroughly enjoyed her arc in S2. Let’s not forget about Chang who’s a male badass in the show but unfortunately, we get very little of him. One nit-pick from my side is that the ladies go through their own tragic backstories, further developing their characters while guys were put to the side. The OVA even shed a glimpse into the past of Revy and you can then understand why she is the way she is but we get nothing for Dutch or Benny. 
 
 
The OP is as badass as the anime itself, perfectly setting the mood for some hardcore action. For such a standard track, it doesn't warrant you singing along or anything but it definitely gets its job done by pumping up the action scenes. The good use of sound effects for the car chases and explosions further improved the overall effect of those set pieces. And then the dubbing, which is some top-notch stuff. I loved, loved and loved Hendrikse’s portrayal of Revy!!! She so perfectly embodied Revy’s voice with her masterful give and take choice of words and tone that puts the subs to shame! Plus, the characters of the show themselves aren’t Asian so the dubs gave an International feeling to the show which was required. Aside from great characters, we were also nursed with great dialogues, uncensored with profanity and energy! Finally, the animation here is excellent in both the character design and art work. The characters all have a uniqueness to them which’s strongly displayed throughout the show. I never felt like I was watching a generic villain of the week with a different hairstyle or clothing, they really felt different from one another. The highly-distinguished artwork on Revy mannerisms, movements and expressions is further proof of the amount of quality work that went into this anime. And let’s not forget about those action scenes! We have tons of them, ranging from fights on boats to ships to underwater submarine, car chases, bomb blasts and tons of gun battles! Despite so much variety of action, you are never bored with any of them for they are well choregraphed no matter how long they get!  
 
 
If there’s any anime that can easily be turned into a live action movie, it’s this one! And Quentin Tarantino should direct it if the casting is well done. S1 focuses on the entire team doing many jobs, basically an intro to all characters while S2 dives deep into the politics and power play of the city and its players. Not a bad direction to venture off to but it came at the expense of the Lagoon team for we only get Rock and Revy. Also in S2 I didn’t like the changes with Revy at first. She’s a total badass in S1 but then she changes in S2, showing a cuter side of herself. She lost that edge of gun blazing insanity streak to her and started smiling more, she even started wearing a skirt and i felt like it was just fan service! I was also afraid they were going to just stick her into a girlfriend role with Rock in S2 but thankfully they further played upon the platonic relationship between those two. You could clearly see a more humane side to Revy, realizing theirs’s a sensitive side deep inside her despite all her ruthlessness. It’s also totally believable since Rock is slowly wearing her defences down and Revy is finding herself more relaxed and comfortable around Rock.  
In conclusion, the anime has an unsatisfying ending! The story conveniently wraps up but we get NO Resolution from the characters which really pissed me off! I still enjoyed this violent and gritty take on crime mafia and the badass characters that run this city though I would have wished for a more complete ending. It’s still worth your time so check it out!

    This was a little over 2 minutes long... all it did was show us what happened after the end of the season which i didnt like at all because it basically showed that he stayed behind to help people even though i liked the idea of him not really dying and him finding the girl in ""real life"". All this did was show the fans what happened almost as if it were a response to all the peoples confusion on how it ended. of course it could easily be a 10 for others but for me it is a 5 at most because they show an ending i did not like if they left it the way they did in the season it would of been a lot more pleased.

    There isn't anything new here. That doesn't mean it isn't the most enjoyable anime of the 2015 Summer Season though. If you're into main characters that kick ass and take names, then this is the show for you. If you're sick of watching NTRs and all that jazz, check out this anime. 
 
If you like fantasy, otaku-pandering, and tons of fun in a virtual world that rocks the boat, then you'll love Overlord. Where SAO had uninspiring character designs, Overlord has a cast that is actually memorable and dynamic. Where Log Horizon struggles with pacing, Overlord keeps you on the edge of your seat. Where NGNL was too mainstream for your hipster-weeb-ways, Overlord is here. 
 
This isn't deep. This is fun. The story is simple and hilarious. It ignores the real world and sticks to the new one, all the while taking you on a ride that is anything but boring. Art is regular. Sound is regular. Characters are above average and make for an enjoyable harem of henchmen.  
 
The Enjoyment. That's why you watch Overlord. It is full of action scenes mixed with light hearted comedy. Anyone with desires of grand power or ambition will enjoy this! You don't watch it for deep political soliloquy or some kind of wonderful plot that leaves you questioning your life's meaning. You watch this because it's fun. Now stop reading reviews and have some fun.

    Jesus christ, okay first of this is an review on the first episode of Yakusoku no Neverland. 
 
 
I've heard a alot about the manga, so i had some expectations and i can safely say, It definitely delivered , I know that It's the first episode and that the first episode is always supposed to have the best quality and stuff since the first impressions supposedly matter the most but I hope they can keep up with the good quality and animations, Im giving this an all around 8 based on the first episode, the sound and the animations was on point, the face animations when they were hiding under the truck, literrally gave me the chills, and the designs on the monsters were very creepy and satisfying in a weird way Xd 
 
Could easily be one of the best animes of 2019, imo :)

    Ill admit, it is lacking a little in character development here and there, and in addition it may have a lacking plot. However, this anime really does end quite well, and it is one of the only animes I was wondering if I can rate over a 10, such as maybe a 12/10. 
 
I cannot completely describe what aspect of this redeems itself to deserve the score, however when you watch it, I think that the combination of elements will speak for itself. 
 
Therefore I would recommend this highly. 
 
Some points I can complement (in specific): 
The theme song and music was very good. Clear crisp tones and crescendos as well as appropriate music for certain events made it all in all a well coordinated, enjoyable experience. 
 
The artwork in some locations was lacking, but on the whole this was some of the best artwork I have seen in comparison to other anime. I know that the anime was possible of exhibiting a much higher standard of art, as they did so on occasion, however this was very good just on general :D 
 
I like the hidden plot as well as symbolism exhibited slightly in many of the actions of the characters as well as the animals. In addition, while they dont develop the characters too much, the characters initial personality is dynamic and fluid and they created an apt persona to the character. It combined appearance and temperment very well. 
 
Basically 
 
W A T CH THIS!

    === STORY === 
The story (at least for the first arc of the show) was fairly interesting. Definitely a unique plot, and it was interesting because it is told from the perspective of the bad guy. It was fun to see how planned to avoid being caught for the crimes he commits, and how the main detective in the story (L), is planning on figuring him out. 
 
Here's the issue. You can only pull off this type of story for about 15-20 episodes, and my interest was waning around the 20 episode point. But then stretching it for another 17 episodes with a new cast of characters really killed it for me. I ended up skipping about 5 episodes and just watching the last 2. 
 
And I have to say, the ending was one of the most disappointing endings I've seen in an anime. It just cuts off at the end. I guess you could argue that the sudden ending resolves it well, but I thought it was just lazy writing (for various reasons - I won't spoil anything). But overall, the second half of the show, including the ending, felt like filler. 
 
=== ART === 
Art was fine. Generic stuff, nothing really fancy to catch your eye. 
 
=== SOUND === 
Main theme at the beginning was good. I literally skipped the theme for the second half every time because it was just screamy rock - extremely grating. Somewhat repetitive themes in the soundtrack, but they're definitely recognizable. 
 
=== CHARACTER === 
There was only character development in the first 14-ish episodes of the show. After a certain point, the characters didn't change (especially the MC, since he couldn't get much more evil - unless he started killing puppies or something). The MC is a total dick, and is really not someone you want to relate to. 
 
There weren't too many interesting characters in this series, as it was more focused on plot, so I was a bit disappointed there. 
 
=== ENJOYMENT === 
I sort of liked it at the beginning. After a while it got too repetitive and was almost a chore to watch. I mostly finished it because I'd already seen 20 episodes and wanted to see if the ending was worth the time I'd spent watching (it wasn't). 
 
=== OVERALL === 
I really think this show is overrated. It's definitely not the best anime of all time, and though it's somewhat original, the execution gets boring after a while. If you watch it, I'd recommend that once you hit the 15 episode mark, skip to the last two episodes. It'll save you time, because there isn't much that happens in between.

    Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a prime example of a show that is too overrated by fans, who easily overlook some gaping plot holes, and downgraded into oblivion by haters, who cannot see anything but those plot holes. I think this show sits somewhere in between: it is a fine show to watch, nothing exeptionally great, but not bad either. If you're trying to decide on watching this, let this be your decision after 1/2 episodes: do you like the character relationship of Ein and Zwei? Go on. If you do not, don't bother with the show. I will try to provide my arguments with as few spoilers as possible, but I cannot completely guarantee a spoiler-free review. Here goes. 
 
== Story == 7 
There are essentially two layers to this anime. On the superficial level, you have your standard mafia-esque corporations trying to gain more power, with the main corperation being Inferno. The distributions in power are a little vague in the beginning, but as the show goes on, one can see that higher-ups in the corperation are allowed a great deal of freedom when it comes to handling problems. Bosses will frequently go behind each other's back to solve personal problems. This would make for quite an interesting story of intrigue, but is a little dulled by the second layer of the show. 
 
The second layers revolves around our two main protagonists, Ein and Zwei. The complex relationship that these two characters have makes for quite an interesting main character cast, but I felt its relationship overshadows the story of Inferno and its attempt at gaining more power in the underworld.  
 
I found myself a little disappointed when the show shifted from the intriguing development of the main characters to highlight the structure and plans of Inferno. I understand that this is necessary for the plot to advance and therefore for the characters to even develop, but hope you also get what I mean by this. The story also suffers from an insanely large plothole, which I could not overlook and I will talk about in the Characters section.  
 
== Characters == 7 
The main characters is where the show truly shines, but is also a big downfall. Ein, being completely brainwashed now has to work together with Zwei, who is in the process of being completely brainwashed, but deep down is heavily conflicted. I loved how their relationship was set up, being purely platonic and bland at first, but slowly turning into something deeper that I will not explain to avoid spoilers. There were times that I completely loathed the decisions they made, which was proof for me that I was quite heavily invested in the main characters.  
 
As with the story, the main characters overshadow the supporting characters, who are in this case mostly Inferno members. This ties into the more 'boring' superficial layer of the story. It was also nice to see that the show pulls off quite a few risky plot-twists, some of which work out greatly, while others fail horribly.  
This leads me to a plot hole, so gapingly large that it almost swallows the entire show. This is also why many people are so put off by this show. About 75% in, there is a time skip of two years. Some characters haven't aged a day, while another turned from a child to an adolescent in a mere two years. Not only is this completely illogical, it was also not even necessary to keep the story going. The story and characters suffer immensely from this. Until the end of the show, I could not get over this. Your opinion on the show will most likely hinge on this specific time skip. I was really put off by this, but continued to watch anyway. The opening and ending also change after this time skip, which made this plot hole even more terribly obvious. Judge this how you will, but you cannot deny the irregularities that this time skip brought.  
 
== Animation == 7 
The animation is good. There is nothing wrong with it, but it isn't amazing either. Some characters, often ladies, are sometimes irregularly shaped (scenes with weirdly long legs or unevenly sized breasts), but the rest looks good. Characters look great, are nicely animated and some painting-like scenery fleshes them out well, while giving you that artsy feeling. 
 
One thing bothered me though, and that has to do with the fan service. In the first minute of the first episode you will see a half-naked lady lying on the beach. BAM! Two tits in your face. While there is nothing wrong with that, I immediately thought: 'Oh it's going to be like that, huh?' But it wasn't. During the rest of the show, the animators went out of their way to not fully show nudity, to the point of unrealistic, nippleless, naked girls, which makes me wonder what the use of that very first scene was to begin with. You have the R+ rating already, so just show nudity when it is appropriate, or fully go out of your way to show nudity, and avoid naked ladies without nipples altogether.  
 
== Sound == 8 
The sound is great. The opening song sets the mood nicely, while tracks in the anime always fit the scenes. Some soundtracks are so great or are so obviously made to make you feel a particular emotion, that it can even feel out-of-place in some scenes. It is just too present and obvious sometimes, but most of the time augments the show perfectly. The second opening and ending songs are used after the time skip for the last few episodes, which made me feel weird, almost insulted. For me there was no reason why they should change the songs to make the time skip even more obnoxious.

There were times when I was heavily invested in the main characters, only to be pulled out again by a dull side-story or hateful decisions some characters make. I still cannot fathom some of the plot twist inducing decisions that were being made and can ultimately also not say that I always enjoyed this show. A few times I just sat there, looking at my screen and asking: 'Why the fuck did you have to do that?' Sometimes the show dragged on for a bit too long on a specific subject or side-story, making me wonder if it had been better for the show if it had a few less episodes. 
 
People have been comparing this show to Black Lagoon a lot, but I must warn you that apart from the mafia groups and the conflicts of the main protagonist, the mood, setting and goal of the shows are completely different. Black Lagoon is much more action-oriented, while Phantom focuses more on character development. 
 
Ultimately, this is not a bad show. It is not amazing either. It's just decent. You will probably like it if you like the relationship of the main characters, but do not try to sell this as the greatest anime ever made, as its flaws are too obvious to ignore.

    **SPOILER WARNING** 
 
At first, this series seemed to be extremely intriguing. I liked the premise of the story, and the art/animation style is gorgeous. But unfortunately, for a majority of the series, that's the only thing that I could say positive. 
 
Alka is an assassin for the Clan of the Sword. She's on a journey to find Jin Varrel, who killed her master Hon. Jin is a demon-like woman who controls the Energy of Chaos and kills without feeling, which is similar to how Alka has learned to kill in her work as an assassin. On her journey, Alka meets three gorgeous, strange women, each a great warrior in her own right and grapples with her slain master's wish that she leave the life of an assassin behind. 
 
Sounds promising right? This series has great potential. But, it develops far too slowly for me. The action, when it does show, is very exciting. But does not occur frequently enough. Like most series, there are flashbacks and back stories that are needed to be shown. Unfortunately, I feel as if it took way too much time, and deviated from the primary plot too often. 
 
I feel as if the series relied too often on the bombshell beauties' looks to maintain the viewers attention. Yes, the female characters are gorgeous. But that can only take a series so far. That being said, the animation style used is outstanding. I thought the colors used really conveyed to the mood of each situation/episode. Same could be said of the music. 
 
Overall, a wonderfully animated series with some great characters. Some great action. But far too much emphasis on the gorgeous (big breasted) characters looks.The series was very slow to develop, and was boring at times.

    This review contains some spoilers. 
 
I think that first of all, as a Final Fantasy fan, I have to say that this is the movie worst adaptated for this universe. I'm not saying that this makes it a bad movie, not at all, but only I wanted to clarify that. Advent Children and The Spirits Within were much more of a Final Fantasy than this one.  
 
Kingsglaive is not a bad movie per se, but it doesn't highlight in anything. Of course, technical section is impressive and impeccable: characters (even if Nyx isn't that well drawn), lights, places... This all is made with perfection so the movie can really be enjoyed.  
 
We have a movie that is divided in three acts: the first one is quite mediocre, as the script is capricious and the structure directly amorphous. We have two kingdoms fighting between each other and the presentation of some characters that are living this. About Nyx, character of Final Fantasy XV, we only know something about him (and see him) at the start (and after the credits) of the movie, and I'm not complaining about this either: I only expose it.  
 
But about Lunafreya, also character of Final Fantasy XV, we know many other things, as she is protagonist alongside Nyx Ulric, a member of the Kingsglaive (Guards of the King), and King Regis, Nyx's father. I do not think that the characters of the film are bad at all: Nyx and Lunafreya are, in my opinion, a bit wasted, and leave Regis as, by far, the best thing of this movie, as he is the only one to really be natural, to really be a character and to breath as one.  
 
As I was saying, the first act is bad, but the second one gets really incredible. The tension that we feel and experience as the movie goes on remembers me about Game of Thrones, specially in the scene where Regis and Iedolas are simply talking. In that moment, we have Nyx fighting to save Lunafreya from General Glauca and an opening of scene very impressive, composed by a certain number of different cameras coming from left and right to the center of the screen. I think that this block of the film in particular, adding the duel in the palace, is very well made (not because of the plot, because we arrive at this point just ""because"", but because of how it is done on-screen).  
 
Nevertheless, the third act is really shameful: it's a constant block of fighting and it seems to never end. I can accept the part of Nyx being the chosen to put the ring and to use its powers; I can accept General Glauca being the leader of the Kingsglaive; and I can also say that I seriously liked the ending scene of Nyx, when the sun sets and he dies peaceful and romantically. What I can't accept is seeing big statues fighting and destroying Insomnia. That is only spectacle with no good reason.  
 
So, is Kingsglaive a good movie? I can certainly say that it is not a bad one, and that is has some interesting ideas, but Nozue, our ""dear"" director of this movie, didn't know how to use them. Anyway, I think it is worth watching.

    Although it isn't exactly long, I'll post a tldr regardless: 
1.Havent watched the original series yet? : The ova feels exactly like the anime and lives up to the hopes of the fans. Therefore this high rating.  
 
2. Liked season 1,disliked Zoku : Maybe you won't appreciate it.  
 
3. Liked season 1, love season 2 even more : The wait is over, you can probably rewatct it till they publish another few volumes and bring about a season 3. 
 
I've met people who liked the good old Oregairu part one and are put off by Zoku since things turned from being light hearted to intense. But then there are people who liked the show even more after Zoku. I obviously fall in the latter category.  
For those of you who liked season one over Zoku, this OVA won't be that memorable since it re-enact the feels from Zoku. Also, if you haven't watched the series and somehow stumbled upon this page and are wondering why everyone's giving it a 10 or so, the answer probably lies in the fact that people either absolutely love this anime or hate it. And since the release happened only yesterday probably the ones who disliked the show didn't bother to check out the OVA. 
Oregairu has always been a special anime for me. Also, since I just finished the OVA chances are that my opinions will be biased. But I don't even care about them being biased anymore since the mighty 8man and gang are back after almost an year.  
The story wasn't any deep, for those of you who aren't aware the 1st part of the OVA is a Canon and the second one isn't. The artwork was awesome as usual. The OVA completely retained the original style of the anime as mentioned by some other reviewers.

    After finishing the actual series, I jumped right to Dark Side of Dimensions, kind of (completely) forgetting that there had once been another Yugioh movie, long ago... And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if you think about it...  
 
This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail.

    Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED) is an anime that capitalizes on emotional appeal. It incorporates plot devices that primarily targets the audience’s pathos and on a surface level achieves this very effectively. Unfortunately, these same plot devices are only contrived for the sole purpose of making the audience have the so-called “feels.” From a more logical perspective, they do not make any sense, and because of this, we are left with an inconsistent plotline that is riddled with flaws. 
 
(Side note: minor spoilers from this point on.) 
 
As one example, consider how Kayo was abused by her mother. Although I am sure the author meant to incorporate some level of realism into his writing, Kayo’s abuse was ultimately used as a way to draw the audience on an emotional basis. Since society frowns down upon all forms of child abuse, most people would accept it at face value and never question it. But let’s be honest for a second: none of it was explained. Why was the abuse occurring? Were there any specific triggers? Why didn’t anyone notice this if this has been happening for years? And so on. 
 
Plus, was it really necessary to use child abuse like this? There are so many other ways that you could have elicited just as powerful of an emotional response and NOT use something controversial. Being heartbroken, amending broken friendships, taking a stand with your friends, etc. (all of which could have been implemented in the context of this show, by the way) could have just as easily done the trick. 
 
Now aside from the emotional appeal, the rest of the plot doesn’t make any sense either. For something that is so fundamental to the plot, there is no explanation as to how Satoru gained the Revival ability other than the fact that he somehow magically has it. In a world that is governed by the natural laws of this universe, the Revival ability hardly seems remotely realistic and, as a result, it seems to serve no real purpose other than to force the plot along. On top of all of that, the Satoru’s Revival ability seemingly has no rules to it other than Satoru’s free will. Need to use it because you really don’t want to go to jail? No problem, Revival time! Don’t need Revival ever again because you said so? Okay adios, now it’s gone. Forever. Because of reasons. 
 
As for pacing, it spans the entire spectrum: fast, slow, just right – it’s all there. Sometimes the show pulls it off just dandy. The first episode, for example, was crazy fast, but it still eked out the main gist of what was going on: Satoru’s weird mysterious power, the main characters, and so on. On the other hand, the last three episodes were fast too, but they were all crammed in a way that resulted in unsubstantial character development (e.g. Hiromi and Aya) even though it was clear from the first episode that the two of them played a significant role in the entire plot. Furthermore, all of this cramming eventually leads to important parts in the manga being left out – so, manga readers, beware! 
 
Now onto the characters. Sure, Satoru is collected and analytical, but his personality is incredibly dry. A lot of the other characters did not stand out that much either, minus maybe the smart, attentive Kenya. But what I found most remarkable about the characters was that some of them shared deep, meaningful relationships. For example: Satoru and his mom, Sachiko. A true motherly figure, Sachiko not only takes care of Satoru but also his friends. She knows how he thinks and operates on a day-to-day basis. She knows when not to pry into her son’s life, and she respects him for who he is as a person. All of this is reflected in the short yet interesting dialogues between her and Satoru. 
 
Unfortunately, some other relationships end up not being as strong as Satoru’s and Sachiko’s. Satoru and Kayo is one example of this. The middle 6 or 7 episodes were intentionally slowed down in terms of pacing so that the two of them could build their relationship from out of thin air to something deep. And for the most part, the show accomplishes this well. But in the last three episodes of the show, the show takes a complete U-turn, tossing out their entire relationship out the window. Now before you accuse me for being super butthurt or laughing at me because their “ship” sank, let me be clear: I would have no problem with this if this were executed well, but let’s break down what happens. To start off, Satoru’s been there for Kayo from the very beginning, so it really does not make sense how she would turn her back on him after Satoru reawakens. Sure, maybe the other-guy-in-the-picture had gotten to know Kayo when Satoru wasn’t physically around, but there was nothing in the anime that suggested such a thing. Just a minute of explanation and leaving things at the status quo wouldn’t be an issue. Satoru and Airi is another example, since the anime leaves out a huge chunk of their relationship in its adaptation. 
 
Moving away from the characters and now onto the sound and the art. The artwork is animated by A-1 Pictures. They’ve also animated Shigatsu, AnoHana, SAO, and the whole spiel so it is done well. Sound is also great. The music was timed well to create an ominous mood when it was needed. Voice acting was decent too, although none of it was that exceptional. 
 
In the grand scheme of things, ERASED is a watchable show and I wouldn’t mind recommending this to others. Emotional appeal isn’t inherently bad. Think about Clannad After Story, Little Busters! Refrain, and others – they all had their charm, and ERASED is just another show that falls into that category. However, basing an entire plot primarily on emotional appeal – that’s when things start to fall apart and become incomprehensible and illogical. That’s why ERASED isn’t a masterpiece – but it’s not downright horrible either.  
 
Overall: C+ 
 
Author's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis. 
 
It should also be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.

    When I was first told about this anime, I was kinda skeptical because I never really knew nothing about Ice Skating and I thought a ice skating anime would be somewhat boring. Since watching this, I have to admit that my liking for ice skating increased and I never knew how beautiful ice skating could actually be. It also helped me discover Ice Skater, Johhny Weir.  
 
I loved how it somewhat showed the gay rights stuff, because I am a member of the LGBT community, and I appreicate that there are animes for different sexualities.  
 
The character Yuri Katsuki, actually showed a similuar personality to me. He let's what people say to him, get to him. He has overthinking issues and stress/anxiety issues which I can completely relate to.  
 
When Victor became his coach I loved how he changed, and became actually happier. So did Victor. 
 
I give the story a 9/10, because I think it will become a 10/10 soon, because I tend to rate stories in 10/10 when something really huge happens or like an accident such as in season 2 or the yuri on ice movie which releases unknown at the moment, I want to see Victor or Yuri possibly suffer an injury on ice and their recovery process. 
 
I give the art 10/10, the art was very good. I loved the character designs and  I really do appreicate Mitsurō Kubo's work, I have always had an interest in her art style and work. 
 
I give the sound 10/10, because the opening was fantastic. One of the best openings I have ever seen tbh and the song to it was beautiful! I also loved the pieces they skated to. I love Yuri On Ice's soundtrack for Yuri. It was a great song and then JJ's song was beautiful. I loved Shall We Skate.  
 
Characters recieve a 9/10 because I relate to them and their personalities are so adorable! 
 
I enjoyed it 10/10 because it was something that helped my migraines/anxiety in January some how. 
 
Overall I would give it a 9.5/10 but I sadly do not have that option so RIP.

    (SPOILERS INCLUDED) 
 
Descent anime. The storyline is not that hard to follow and everything gets explained so it doesn't leave us with an open ending. Characters that grow to us (hopefully right English xD). Very gloomy protagonist (which I personally love). 
 
Now there are also a few things that annoy me about this anime. First of all it gets really annoying to watch Nanami hitting and kicking Souta for every little thing she doesn't like. 
 
Second thing is that the androgynous guy (trap) Megu acts all female and seems happy with it yet demands to be a manly man which does not make any sense. Just let the guy be a femboy and stop bullshitting about him wanting to be recognized as a manly man... 
 
Something else that bothers me in the show that there are way too many underdeveloped characters. And when we think we are getting to know a character, another one suddely appears and forces us to get to know that person too. 
 
The last thing that bothered me was that in the end with the fight, all of a sudden their teacher joined their battle. Why she suddenly knows all about what happened gets never explained... The other characters have a history with Souta, but yet this teacher comes out of nowhere and wants to protect Souta too suddenly... 
 
Conclusion is that the anime is fun to watch and the characters are very sweet but the characters are underdeveloped and sometimes annoying when they don't have to be.

    So, I am editing this review because I clearly made the previous review after listening to the anime community and just playing along with them. This will be a completely honest review on BOKU NO PICO  
 
For this review, I will focus on art, story, sound, characters and my enjoyment... Not that it matter. [Beware of spoilers ahead] 
 
Story/execution: 
Ah! a plot about a 10 year old girl who happens to be a boy meets 40 yr old man and they eat ice cream together. I mean, I have to give credits to them for actually having a story. In all seriousness, story doesn't really matter when it comes to hentai so I will just talk about the execution. I will admit that at times Boku No Pico does manage to keep the boner going... Oh god! I feel so weird saying this but it's true. Some scenes can be pretty nice if you think about it. But the moment Pico takes his little pants of, you get reminded of that dreadful feeling. As far as hentai goes, Boku No Pico just doesn't work when you are reminded that Pico is a boy, yes a 10 year old boy. But only a split second of a different scene might get you satisfied. However, if you are a fan of yaoi then I guess have fun with this hentai, because they do nail the yaoi scenes. 
 
Art: 
Perfect art style for a hentai, not a big fan of this art style though.  
 
sound: 
 
pico: N-no! it feels so good! 
 
middle age man: Oh, this will feel way better! 
 
and a bunch of other unnecessary sounds coming from the 10 year old 
 
Characters: 
Let's be real, nobody wants to see a 10 year old child in a maid costume pulling out his penis. It just looks wrong, feels wrong and it's more discomforting then arousing. They also say ""This is to be taken as art and not distribution of child pornography at the beginning"" So, this is apparently art. However, pico can look cute at times and some of the other kids in the show can also look cute at times. I am trying my best to give some positive feedback and I know that this show has gotten some things right. It's just that it is very hard to put it in a positive way. 
 
enjoyment: 
 
No matter how bad this is, I will never get bored of face palming while watching. This is more of an anime that you can watch as a joke. However, if you like yaoi then maybe this one is for you!

    A close acquaintance of mine once asked me ""what, in my opinion, is the quintessential Detective Conan movie?"". For some time, I thought that all a movie needed to be good was to have good pacing, clear focus, and an incentive to see things to the end. While those elements are necessary for a movie to be ""good"", what does it mean for a movie to be a ""good Detective Conan movie""? In my mind, that kind of movie must embody everything Detective Conan is about; A brilliant detective robbed of his adult body that must solve murder cases with the police in order to bring the organization responsible to justice. In my journey to review each and every one of these movies, Detective Conan: The Raven Chaser not only fulfills the requirements to be a great movie overall, but also the best Detective Conan movie so far. 
 
One of the best things this movie is able to do is juggle a massive cast of characters and make each and every one of them important. Conan isn't the only star of this film; we have Ran, Kogoro, the Detective Boys, Megure and the police force, and the Black Organization (not to mention the film's original characters). Despite the cast being massive, each and every person in this movie has a purpose that is essential to the resolution of the story. In most movies with a large cast, they often run the risk of either overstaying their welcome or just blend in with the background. In entire run time of this movie, not once did I experience that kind of blunder. This is only one of the several things this movie gets right. 
 
Another thing that this movie gets right is its story. While the Black Organization is present in this film, the main focus for Conan (and for them as well) is to find the culprit responsible for the serial murders taking place all over Japan. With Conan's identity at stake, its a race against the clock to find the culprit before they do. This probably has to be one of the best constructed cases in the movies so far. The majhong tiles and the phrase ""Tanabata... Kyo.."" have more meaning behind them than one might think. This movie has so many layers that it is literary a treat to re-watch it over and over again. Along with the three elements I mentioned above, Raven Chaser is also an overall great movie. 
 
As much as I love this movie, I will concede to it not being perfect. What happens to the Organization in the end is a bit unsatisfying, the reasoning for the true culprit is a bit of a stretch, one of the key plot points does reference a spoiler in the main series, and while the art style is great,  it does utilize some pretty obvious CGI in a few spots. Not enough to ruin the film, but worth mentioning.  
 
This movie is so good that the only bad thing about it is that every other movie after it always falls short because of it (all have tried, but none prevailed). Despite that, I'm truly happy that a movie like this exists. If anyone were to ask me what the quintessential Detective Conan movie is, I would point them to Raven Chaser any day of the week.

    Why You Should Watch Little Witch Academia 
 
I’ve fallen in love with the Netflix series Little Witch Academia. 
 
LWA follows Akko Kagari who, despite having no natural aptitude for magic, enrolls at Luna Nova Witchcraft Academy to follow in the footsteps of her hero, the legendary witch Shiny Chariot. What I absolutely adore about LWA is how it perfectly combines elements of Western and Eastern animation/storytelling. On the Western side, it’s obvious the premise of the show was inspired by Harry Potter. Like Harry, Akko herself has no magic experience before being whisked away to magic school where she meets a blonde Malfoy-esque rival character in Diana, complete with her own Crabbe and Goyle equivalents. There are even little references to Harry Potter sprinkled in: magic is powered by the Sorcerer’s Stone and there’s a broomstick called the Shooting Star. On the Eastern side, many of the characters are rooted in Japanese archetypes including Genki (Akko), Meganekko (Lotte), Kamidere (Diana), and Bokukko (Amanda). However, their characterizations are subtle enough to overcome cultural barriers and fit perfectly into a Western style story. This East meets West style can even be seen in the animation and art which are reminiscent of early Disney, conveying a sense of wonder and energy yet still being rooted in anime aesthetics - imagine mixing The Sorcerer’s Apprentice from Fantasia and giving it an anime coat of paint. Add to that excellent acting in either English or Japanese and this melting pot of cultures can be enjoyed by anyone and is the perfect show to watch with younger siblings.  
 
Ultimately if Avatar the Last Airbender is what happens when Western creators look eastward for inspiration, Little Witch Academia is what happens when Eastern creators look westward. Do yourselves a solid and watch this show! 
 
HOW TO WATCH 
There are 2 specials, which essentially act as pilots, and a 25-episode series. If you’re already sold I recommend starting with the specials (Little Witch Academia, followed by the Enchanted Parade), then watching the series. If not, start with the series (which I feel does a better job at selling the series) then go back to the specials.

    Your Name is an animated film by Makoto Shinkai, probably my favourite director for anime or just movies in general. Other pieces Makoto Shinkai is well known for include Distant Star and, of course, Five Centimeters per Second. Your Name, or Kimi No Na Wa as it’s known in Japan, is about two high school students, Mitsuha and Taki, switch bodies. Each of them live in very different areas of Japan. Taki being from Tokyo and Mitsuha being from a rural area in Japan. The mysterious events of their body swapping, which happens a few times every week, all begins on the day when a mysterious shooting star falls across the sky.  
 
The Animation: 
It is clear when watching this film that the animators must have poured their hearts and souls into these visuals. The truly spectacular scenes where this is particularly apparent is when we see the shooting star near the start of the film and the final scene of the movie. The amount of time and effort which must have been put into these moments and the entire film must have been huge. The animators hard work has clearly been well worth it. The level of detail in the light and the shading is astonishing. Another part of the animation which I really appreciate, is the fact that all the places shown in the film are real places which you can go and visit. This even goes as far as the billboards in some scenes being the same as the ones in the real place, meaning someone had to gain the rights to show the real adverts in this movie. So that just goes to show how much effort the animators when through to make this film feel immersive and real. 
Overall, I give the animation of this film a 10/10. 
 
Story: 
The story of Your Name is arguable simple. Two people having their bodies swapped and living in each others shoes has been done many times before, like in Freaky Friday. But, I believe that even with this somewhat simple plot Shinkai has really used the characters in the story to really make the audience feel for these people. When we see Mitsuha in her home with her family, we really do feel like they are a family and that they feel real like they actually exist. In addition, with Taki, we see and can sympathise with his struggles with balancing his social, school, and work lives. Although Your Name does have comedic moments and serious dramatic moments, it doesn’t feel like the film is “switching genres” halfway through or like one moment it’s all fun and gags and the next it's overly dramatic. It all feels consistent and the humour of the film does not clash with the more heart wrenching parts. One of my favourite parts of the entire film, is the ending. I feel that Makoto Shinkai has given the audience an ending which is satisfying but still leaves enough unanswered to let the audience think. 
Overall, the story gets a 8/10. 
 
The soundtrack: 
The soundtrack of Your Name is, in my opinion a big part of the film. WIthout the songs from Radwimps I don’t think the film would be as good as it is. Simply just because their songs are used perfectly to fit the scenes to evoke emotions like sadness, relief, and happiness in the audience. Whenever I hear a song from Your Name, I get goosebumps, because the soundtrack really does have a big part in the emotional scenes in the film, so when you listen to them it brings all back. 
Overall, the soundtrack gets an 10/10. 
 
Conclusion and final thoughts: 
After watching Your Name twice now I really do believe this film could be thought of as a modern classic in anime. So far I would say that this is probably the best of Makoto Shinkai’s works. And I think a lot of people would agree. Your Name actually gained a total gross of 358 million us dollars, making it the highest grossing animated film and japanese film of all time. Beating out films like the Incredibles, Aladin, and all the other classic american and japanese animated films. According to some reports people re-watched the film up to twelve times at the cinema. I can understand that because when i watched Your Name a second time, it was different from watching it the first time because you notice so many different things. Like the red ribbon of fate, the opening basically spoiling the whole movie if you pay attention and little hints at the ending and the big twist of the story throughout the film. I really did love Your Name or Kimi No Na Wa and would say it’s one of, or is, my favorite film.  
 
Overall, I give Your Name a score of 10/10.

    If I were to say one thing about NANA it would most likely be &quot;Wow&quot; 
NANA is I think one of the most real life animes I have ever wacthed, I mean it was like someone took the life of a punk*cough* band and stuck it into the T.V. 
Alot of things were are wrapped up in this: joy,sorrow,love,hate,and even the &quot;think before you do&quot; statement comes aroud A LOT.( If you wacth it you'll know what I mean by that).There's awesome music too XD, just thought I through that on there. 
 
I remeber when I was wacthing this, it suprised me, now usually animes don't have the power to do that because a lot of them take the same polt and just stick new characters in it. But no with NANA, noooooo.  
Just to finsh this up it is an amazing heart warming anime, I mean sure it has it's parts where you think, &quot;Gawd, I don't care. lets get a move on with the plot here!&quot; , but most long animes make you think that. 
But anyway go to you're GOOGLE bar or where ever and type in &quot; NANA episode 1&quot;.........NOW!

    If you're reading this review then I am pretty confident you either know exactly what Anohana is about, or you have watched it and want to see what others think about it. What do I think? This is probably one of the greatest animes I have ever watched. 
 
I made the choice to power through this series in one day, one sitting, and I honestly don't think you would be able to do it any other way. The story is so gripping, and so personal on every possible level that it is truly amazing. You will find a connection to this series in some way, shape or form, whether it be character design, story or scenery. 
 
It definitely deals heavily with ""To live is to lose"", and the end of the series embraces that in its fullest.  
 
I won't bore with too many details, if you've watched it I hope you loved it as much as I did, If you haven't then please do. 
 
Personal favourite character - Poppo 
Least favourite character - Yukiatsu 
Favourite Episode - Can't remember specifically the # but when Menma makes steamed bread for everyone. (9 or 10 I think)

    When I started watching No Game No Life, I didn't really know what to expect. I didn't ever plan to see it, hell, I didn't even know it existed and was airing (I'm still not used to keeping track of new animes coming out). Thankfully, though, my friends told me about it somewhere around episode 7 and after I got convinced and caught up with the episodes, I had the great pleasure of watching it as it was aired, getting sucked into the story, holding my breath and uttering screams of protest at the cliffhangers with the rest of the Internet community... and basically just having tons of fun watching it. 
 
I've been wanting to write a review of NGNL for quite some time now, but I decided that I'll only do so when it finishes. While I am very much part of the hype surrounding NGNL, I wanted to wait and see whether the writers manage to finish as well as they started and keep the anime entertaining and clever till the very end. I can with pleasure say that they indeed did a great job, and while it is definitely not free of faults, I have many good things to see about this anime. 
 
Pardon for the incoming wall-of-text. But that's just how I roll. 
 
Note: I didn't read the light novel on which NGNL is based, so I'll just review this anime regardless of the LN. 
 
Enjoyment/fanservice: 9 
 
Normally, this section would be the last in my review, as it should be, but in the case of NGNL, there is something that must be said at the very beginning: NGNL fanservice level is off the charts. Ecchi moments are plentiful, cute animal girls as well in the last few episodes, basically just a dream come true for Sora, the lead male character. However, what is extraordinary, is the way in which the writers make it work. I mean probably not everyone will agree, but for me, personally, fanservice usually serves little purpose, but in NGNL, it was always done in a clever way and it always felt like not one wink from the creators, but two: first one for ""Hey, here's something for ya"" and the second one for ""Yup, we damn well know this is blatant fanservice, but just watch us do it with style"". Especially in the glorious episode 6 you can see how they manage to justify so much with the plot. 
And of course it's still fanservice, nothing more. But the creators never go too far, one of their favorite things to do is to tease the viewer with something that seems like the oh-so-cliche incest theme, only to turn it into a huge joke a few seconds later. Basically, the writers seem to be having as much fun as the viewer, both pleasing and teasing him. It definitely is one of the main things that makes this anime extremely enjoyable... and I'm seriously not talking about just the jiggly boobs, believe me, as a still single male I tend to stay away from echhi for sanity's sake, but it's just the way in which it's done. So even if ecchi is not your thing, give this anime a chance. If anything, it's just a perfect humorous addition to an anime that is... perhaps surprisingly, so much more. 
Of course, since I started with enjoyment, I need to highlight the most prominent aspect of the anime: games. In an anime where everything is about games, the whole idea could've just collapsed if the games were just your run-off-the-mill games, but thankfully the games the main characters' find themselves playing are always original and unique takes on well-known games and are plenty of fun to watch. Especially when the genius-gamer mode gets switched on. 
 
Story: 9 
 
Frankly, I haven't seen enough animes to be one to talk about originality and interesting concepts. I'm pretty sure games and gamers are quite a popular motive in the anime/manga industry. Regardless of that, however, I think the story of No Game No Life has a fantastic concept - I mean two siblings who are absolute masters of games but hate real life getting transported by a childlike god of games into a fantastic world where literally everything is a game? How could a perfect setting like that go wrong? 
Well naturally, it could have. Quite easily, as many great ideas can get wasted. But thankfully the writers made sure to keep up with the pace they set themselves and not only did they make sure to keep the story interesting until the very end with various twists and turns, they also managed to entertain me heartily with unique games the characters played - and the usually mind-blowing strategies that came with them. I have to admit that the ending of this season was not as spectacular as I had hoped, but it wasn't bad either and it did directly suggest a season 2 coming, so I'm not going to go complaining about it. 
One issue I had with the story is that sometimes the train of thought of Sora or Shiro got hard to follow and I needed to rewatch some moments to fully grasp what's going on in their heads. Also, the further the anime progressed, the more far-fetched the main characters' genius mind abilities became and even for a completely unbelievable setting like this they were a bit TOO unbelievable. But those were rather minor faults. 
Some might complain that the pacing was uneven - there is some truth in that. The fast-paced episodes, which were usually about the main pair playing a grand game against an opponent were usually intertwined with slower episodes which set the stage. But personally, while it was noticeable, I don't necessarily think it was a bad thing, especially since the slower episodes gave us interesting backstories, progressed the characters' relations and, like I just mentioned, set the stage for the action-packed games. 
 
Art: 8 
 
I gotta admit, when I first saw NGNL, I really didn't like the rather clashing color palette used to depict the fantasy game world. It seemed too sweet yet at the same time too aggressive for the eye. But maybe it was just because I simply wasn't used to colors as bold as these in animes (that's saying something, isn't it?) and it was a bit of a shock, because with time not only did I get used to it, I started to grow very fond of it since it proved to be a huge asset of making the game world seem like, well, a game. Also, it went with a quite unique style (I especially enjoyed the different shapes of eye irises according to race) which made all the intense moments even more intense... and the cute things even cuter. So in the end, while it slightly scared me at first, the art became one of my favorite aspects of this anime in the end. 
 
Sound: 8 
 
The soundtrack was good. On one hand, I can't remember any memorable themes from this anime, but on the other hand that's not necessarily the point of OSTs. Because what the soundtrack should do (and it did in this anime) is just play in the background, helping build up the atmosphere, quicken up the pace in moments full of action and setting up the right mood when things got serious for a moment.  
The opening was quite decent, but personally I preferws the ending. The ending was quite different from the rest of the anime, I'd even risk saying it was quite touching, but still both the OP and ED fit the anime very well in my opinion. 
The voice acting, while not something absolutely mind-blowing, was also good. I think the voices fit the characters very well and were pleasing to the ear, so the VA will surely not get in the way of you enjoying the anime 
 
Characters: 8 
 
As in most animes with 12-13 episodes, there is relatively little time for building relations and character development and such is the case here. We don't see much (if any) character development or relation progressing, but then I wouldn't say it's really something that's missing in this anime. The characters are an entertaining bunch, they interact with each other well, giving us both hilarious and touching moments, keeping the story involving. The supporting characters, while not extremely complex or original, are still given some interesting backstories and traits that make them important parts of the story. 
However, it's the main protagonist duo that really got me really attached to this anime. While, as I mentioned before, the creators tend to joke around and tease the viewer by adding some brother-sister lovin' jokes here and there, in reality Sora's and Shiro's relationship actually strikes me as very deep and even moving. They are literally everything to each other. They spent their entire childhood together, hiding themselves from society and becoming the legendary unbeatable ""Blank"" gaming team together and it is quite often emphasized how important they are to each other. Not only in comedy, but also in some touching moments. Especially one episode (about which I can't say much for the sake of not spoiling it to anyone) explored their attachment to one another and for me it was one of the best, if not the best, episodes of the anime. Especially since it was paired with a mind blowing solution to a game, naturally. 
 
 
So to sum up, NGNL is quite an unique anime. It has a great setting and an interesting plot, it brings plenty of enjoyment with it's games and hilarious fanservice. It has it's faults as far as the story is concerned and I guess quite a few people will find the cliches and fanservice tiring, but I personally enjoyed it immensely. While I don't think it's current standing on MAL's top anime list is really deserved (but isn't that always the case when hype is up), I definitely think it's something every anime fan should at least check out. And if you don't like it, at least check out episode 6 because that truly is something. 
 
So yeah, I highly recommend it. Just don't watch it with friends unfamiliar with anime nearby, or if they peek at your screen at the wrong moment you'll have a hard time explaining how this anime is, after all, not about boobs and that it is just ""part of the game they're playing"" ;P 
 
Cheers!

    I have watched this show over 3 times and I fall in love with it every single time.  When I'm tired or having a bad day or just don't know what to watch, I just grab some popcorn and put on any of the Trigun's episodes and I end up forgetting about everything else. Trigun is what I believe to be a perfect anime and one of it's key features to watch out for are the imagery, the play on words, the references to our society as in the different types of people. This series combines the action that kids love and the lesson that even adults need to learn. 
 
Story: 
There are 2 stories we are dealing, first is the main story of the anime and the second is the sub story of different episodes. The sub stories are brilliant, each one has a different moral and they slowly add to the main story bit by bit until it reaches the climax. I didn't like the main story as much cause it was a bit slow though it did live up to it's expectations. From a good laugh to a life and death situation to a question on society, Trigun manages to do it all. 
 
Art: 
Initially I was very reluctant to watch this show as it was animated in 1998 so I thought the  art and animation were gonna be terrible but boy I was wrong, from super powered robots to western gun fights, everything was beautiful.People say that ""you can tell a man by his shoes."",well in anime its not the shoes but the hairstyles and Trigun's quite an elaborate set of hairstyles. Almost all the characters had different hairstyles and clothes. 
 
Sound: 
I've seen this show dubbed and subbed and both have great voice actors and actresses. Great soundtracks and brilliant openings and endings. 
 
Overall: 
If you haven't this show, you are missing out. If you have, I recommend you watch it again and look out for the imagery or google it. I am pretty sure you might have missed something. I mean the series did manage to get a movie 12 years after the series ended. 
 
Thank you,

    I will give my review here as a whole for my review to the national tournament arc 
 
So the most arrogant and show-off sports protagonist returns together with his teammates to play in the most awaited tournament that they’ve been waiting for;  the national tournament. The drama is even more far-fetched and can be extremely over-the-top; players are on the verge of dying just by PLAYING tennis, losing memories before an important game, bloods are spilling everywhere. I mean come on! I almost forgot that I am still watching a tennis story particularly, the finals arc. I completely understand that it’s going for a more dramatic, theatrical and cooler approach as it is after all the ENDING. However, there’s also the concept of TOO MUCH and being incredibly over done. Somewhere along the way, it becomes absolutely far-fetched. I notice that the comedy part really improves. It is no longer far-fetched and can be genuinely funny. And if there are several exaggerated moves and techniques from before, this time they even added stances with supposedly amazing auras which are extremely exaggerated. 
 
Of course, as it is a new chapter it is given that there’s an arrival of new characters. As always, the opponents are arrogant as ever. And if last time there is quite a few nasty opponents, this time some are even nastier and barbaric because they would even resort to hitting couches and elderly people. Well, when opponents are like that it feels even greater when they are amazingly defeated. There are also character developments for not only the main characters but for recurring characters as well. Characters are more expressive this time particularly the ones with poker faces like Tezuka. Some opponents are a lot stronger now as we see some of powerful characters gets beaten or really push to the limit. 
 
I believe the most noticeable improvement is the animation. As always, this series loves exaggerated moves and very fictional techniques during matches. And if in the last season it was made so over the top, this time it improves quite a bit. It is a little bit cleaner now. It looks better and cooler. It’s not that far-fetched compared from the previous season. It might still be exaggerated but at least it is done a little better this time. The improvement of the character design is also very noticeable. 
 
It is true that as always there are countless exaggerated elements in the series. You could even say that it is even more this time. But I guess that just how the series is. I myself may not like that part of the series but I believe it is quite effective for some. And I enjoyed it more compared to the previous one.

    Ever wondered what you should do with your life?  
 
The sheer pressure of making something worthwhile of one's life has probably hit many of us at least one point in life. Maybe that's why Hachiken's struggle hits so close to home. 
 
Maybe that's also why I quickly marathoned every episode hoping that he would find his answer by the end of it all. Though following his journey I together with him discovered that there's other important things that requires your attention and that if you don't force it, the answer will surely come one day. If you think too much about it, you will miss a lot of fun things that you will never be able to get back. 
 
Silver spoon is a light hearted SOL that is fitting for everyone, whether you are interested in agriculture or not the way it present itself to the viewer makes it really interesting.  
 
Together with its seemingly large cast it makes for a hilarious trip through its 12 episodes. It's difficult to not like every single one of them and to certain degrees emphatize with their struggles because it feels so real. 
 
Though a lot happens through the episodes, plot wise not a lot develops and by the end of it, everyone is basically the same. But that's ok, because the charm is the humor, characters and overall light hearted tone that makes Silver spoon a fun, heart warming ride. While you won't come out as a new person after watching it, you will hopefully end it with a smile on your face just like I did as you click on season 2.

    Normally  i would avoid watching shows of this nature, but K-on is an exception to how i view shows like this. K-on on the surface looks like a generic cute girls shows with lots   events that don't matter. However in a sense it is very close to being a masterpiece. This primarily because Naoko Yamada and the team at Kyoto animation elevated it higher than its source material. 
 
        Story:8/10 
K-on story is about how people become better and function better with friends and the way it executes the premise is honestly flawless in a myraid of ways. The show gets better with every step of the way . The buildup of the scenes are incredible especially toward the end of this series when the band makes the song which is the emotional climax. Most of the episodes are lighthearted like any other show but the events that are portrayed are more significant than others. Some criticize K-on as uneventful, however i feel like people don't  open their minds enough to understand the show a little better. It would also allow more people to see K-on as not just any ordinary show of its genre   . I do agree the show at certain episodes can get boring with beach episodes,but overall the episodes are very good at communicating the main point of the show. 
Art:9/10 
The art is unquestionably beautiful. the gradients work well with the designs of the characters and the two tone shading also is well done. The artwork of the background is actually detailed and beautiful which is typical of Kyoto animation 
 
Sound: 8/10-The timing of the use of sounds is brilliant and well thought out. The voice actor are great at certain the sense of cohesion with the jokes that occur in K-on . 
 
Characters 9/10:- Lovable and relatable especially Azusa 's situation with her friends. The character have great chemistry with their jokes and the groups relationship continuing  to build which makes you invested in the characters. The characterization is less obvious than other animes 
 Naoko Yamada uses the camera  to focus on  the girls legs by showing how they  move in comparison to the first season to tell us the change in personality and how the groups friendship has changed the characters. 
Overall: 9/10

    Did you fell in love?  Broken-hearted  and was left behind at the very end?  
 
I fell in love with someone and that was in my High School days. Being loved for nothing hurts the most. Seeing your girlfriend crying because she loves someone other than me. That's the reason why I liked and disliked this anime :)  
 
If you experience this kind of relationship then this is the anime that suits for you. I liked this anime because it resembles my bittersweet memories of my girlfriend in my High school days. The anime was entirely great especially the story itself. I disliked this anime because it made me remember the times that I was left behind. Suffering from pain and being alone.

The story is entirely great. Making a love story anime is not that great but this anime deserves the spot. Getting strucked by the love triangle in the story and how they will solve their problems together. Practicing their music notes and arrangements in the house of their friend and aiming to pursue themselves to their respective goals.  
 
 
 
 
 
Art: 8/10 
 
The art makes this anime feel the essence of the story. The season is somewhat connecting to the route of the story. Being lonely at winter and happy in Fall. White Album 2 is the color of snow and snow is use to symbolize being cold to others and alone.  Although the art is not unique but the art itself is the resemblance of this Anime.  
 
 
Sound: 10/10 
 
One of the reasons that I have watched this anime is because of the sounds that are used and composed mostly by instruments(piano, electric guitar, saxophone, keyboard) The background music fits the story and every part of the anime. The music that are used is sad but encouraging me to feel more what love is and what part of love is hurting the most.  
 
 
Character: 8/10 
 
There are 3 main characters in the story. 1 boy and 2 girls that wants to perform in their school festival. They used their music capabilities to fulfill their goals in life and make these 3 characters to be together forever. They are being loved and love and that's love triangle will happen.  
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
 
I enjoyed the anime from the first episode up to the last. What I enjoyed the most is how they will manage their relationship to each other. Not every anime is like this and that's why enjoyed this.  
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
White Album is your romance and drama anime. For me, this anime defines what ""love"" really is. How can we manage ourselves when it comes to love. Are we giving-up for our loved ones or are we fighting to show our love for them? If you feel what I feel then this is the anime for you

    First off, VERY misleading title, seeing as the ending AFTER THE CREDITS is the only REAL story development we get out of this ""season 2"" of the seven deadly sins. I use quotation because it was so short that if my internet hadn't been down the last 4 days i could have finished it in like 2 hours. Although watching this was kind of a nice break from the series plot points and started doing a little more character development (which they threw out the window COMPLETELY) and fooled around a little with the characters in a canon OVA style show. I find it sad to say that the only appealing part to all of this was the visuals and the fight scenes(love me a good SDS fight). and also, more fanservice. the one thing that brings down an anime in my opinion. Welp, here's to hoping the REAL season 2 will be better than this mess of an adaption.

    Sudden like a lightning bold it struck, extremely average looking with the classic seasonal trash vibes to it. It seemed like you're typical harem ecchi-heavy show until you realize how massive of a following it had. 
“Nande Koko ni Sensei ga?” is relatively short series that politely asked you to leave every shred of logic you'd expect and just enjoy the ride for what it is. It did not take itself too seriously, it did not bring anything new to the table either. 
 
- Story (5.5/10): 
Four teenage male students and four female teachers, one having a crush on another meet a ba- ugh, at a school, they meet at a school. A couple of breaks later, an Anime is born. 
While not very problematic, I would drop it right off the bat and say that the show is at the very core lacks every sense of depth from what comes of a thought striking story. 
It composed of a brief crossover of four related stories with interchangeable characters playing a game of odds, and it just happens to have all of them going for the protagonists. They might say love is a battlefield or some cliché crap, but this show makes you question your life choices and making you start wondering, “Did I go to the wrong school?”. 
 
- Art (7/10): 
As average as the topic it tackles, it was nothing special, very generic but just about enough to keep you watching. You better not expect any high budget over 60 fps fluid eye candy, that is, if your definition of eye-candy is something entirely different which I totally agree with, then you'll probably end up disappointed, however, to the meaty kind of eye candy I was alluding to, you bet you're going get your fill. Beautifully illustrated erotic shots make up at least 60% of the episode, which is always the selling point for this kind of shows, a welcomed feat by the way. 
 
- Sound (7.3/10): 
  As long as my eyes enjoyed the view, my ears didn't really get anything of nearly similar quality. Very basic voice acting at best, but when you come to playing roles that involve in dialogue with more moans than words, then you've got a great excuse. 
On the other hand, the opening and ending songs were just amazing, I'm expecting those to appear on the next popular Anime song quiz on Youtube. 
 
- Character (6/10): 
I'm going to have to be fair in here, that's not the greatest cast of characters I've seen, and not nearly the worst either. 
All pairings were very unique with respect to each other. But not nearly enough depth to them to make them that memorable, I haven't been able to memorize any names from the show, ending up forgetting about them just after I read them on every subtitle. In respect to their designs, very average which only falls on the Art department too. 
 
- Enjoyment (8.5/10): 
I just love the concept. Starting off every episode with repeating the same words that make the title of the series “Nande Koko ni Sensei ga?” made for hilarious moments, even though they always seemed heavily predictable. The ships were all great except for the dangerously pedophilic one (The athletic teacher and the petite boy). 
 
- Overall (6.68/10): 
I'm quite surprised with how low it scores on paper, I was preparing to drop a rating around 7 and 7.5, however, I can't recommend it highly enough if you're in for some short ecchi comedy heavy show that really pushes it as far as it can and not nitpick about every detail.

    Oh my goodness, I loved this anime! It's been a long time since I've watched an anime through in just a matter of days; I was obsessed with finishing it! Yona of the Dawn is such an enjoyable story, with memorable characters. I plan on reading the manga now, since I didn't want the show to end and I've heard the manga is ongoing. 
 
Story: 
This is not your typical shojo, with the girl obsessed over a boy or her looks or finally getting a date. Yona is on a serious mission, and the story drew me in completely. I loved how Yona is more than ""just a girl,"" and even though she is weak and naive at first, she grows and becomes strong.  
 
Art: 
Beautiful! I loved how the characters were drawn and the attention to detail with scenery. An absolutely lovely anime to watch. 
 
Sound: 
This is one of the few anime in which I did not skip the intro song or the credits song. The music was beautiful! Even my husband, who was in another room at the time, came out and said, ""I love this music."" I also loved the instrumentals throughout. 
 
Character: 
Every character had a story, and I found that even on the episodes that diverted from the main character, Yona, I was drawn in and intrigued. I even felt sympathy for the villain, Soo-Won! However, it really is Yona that draws the story together. She is perhaps my favorite anime heroine. As I said above, she grows from a rather weak, flawed character to one with strength and courage.  
 
I definitely recommend watching this anime if you haven't already. It has now become one of my absolute favorites!

    The main girl(Kaori) has memory problems and loses her memories every week. She's a loner because of this but one boy Hase Yuki goes up to her and asks her to be friends with him. He doesn't give up and that's where the magical relationship happens. I really enjoyed this anime the characters being the main reason. Especially my man Shougo. Let's go over the characters. The main girl Kaori is a very kind, sweet and pure type of girl. She puts up a cold hearted attitude because she is afraid of making friends. The main guy Hase Yuuki is a very kind boy who is sensitive, worries a lot, and is sometimes slightly possessive of Kaori. Now the awesome side characters. Saki is a forgetful girl who is clumsy, friendly, and a little silly. Then we have my favorite guy Shougo. He has no problems speaking his mind and is very smart/logical. He may seem like a mean dude but he's actually a kind person at heart. He gets Mahiro back on track so many times and he talks sense into all the characters. He really is an awesome friend and adds a lot of humor into the show with his witty remarks. This show is nice and heartwarming and didn't make me cry like a baby like clannad, plastic memories or anything like that. It will make you feel a lot of emotions but I think heartwarming is the best one it'll  make you feel.

    Continuing from where the last movie leaves off, Guts leaves the Band of the Hawk and Griffith is captured. It is now a year later and Guts has returned to save Griffith who is now only beyond a mere shell of his former glory self. Anyway, I say this has been the best movie of the trilogy so far. In context to story, the beginning is very rushed and some scenes are taken out from the original manga and some are properly rearranged. But it doesn't really hurt the flow for the story in relation to the movie. It works in its own way, but I will admit as a manga purist, idealistically, I wish it followed the manga 100% to a t, but that's just me. This movie is now 2 hours so it allows more content, though I wish all the movies were 2 hours.  
 
The controversial CG in my humble opinion, has improved but still has its problems. I say the frame rate is more even and the frame size in proportion to the characters and foreground appropriately accommodates it. It still comes across as ""gamey,"" but it is an improvement, but by no means perfect. The action is very violent and lives up to its bad ass title. There will be plenty of blood and gore. Even though Guts is the main character and a bad ass, I will admit when this guy fights, he scares me and this movie does a good job of making me scared of the main character. There's nothing to fear, but fear itself, but fear fears Guts. On a list of top anime bad asses, Guts has to be on that list no doubt.  
 
I say what defines the art and animation is how it sets the atmosphere and brings you into the emotions. You feel Griffith's fragility. Even though you don't see him unmasked, the detail to the art on whatever you see of his face is enough to give you an idea of what he would look like if unmasked. You see the hesitation of Guts on whether or not he should leave the Hawks again. You feel Casca's frustrations. I feel that the raw emotions bring a sense of substance in conjunction to its R-15+ (the equivalent to an NC-17 in America) rating.  
 
The voice acting, as I have admitted in previous reviews, has been an issue for me. I will admit that Guts' new actor has shown improvement and shown instances that he can capture the character. But I will openly admit as a purist and fanboy that Nobutoshi Canna is still Guts to me while Michael Bell will always be his English voice to me. The guy who plays Jedau does an ok imitation of the character's original voice actor, Ishida Akira. Maybe for people not familiar with the previous anime series and the games will not find this to be an issue and may like the voice actors. 
 
Like the second movie, the soundtrack is more acoustics and orchestrated. My thoughts on that carry onto this movie as well. It suits the time period very well and knows how to suit the atmosphere. The orchestra in the ending credits was very impressive. Susumu Hirakawa still does the opening theme and is my favorite part of the soundtrack. Still, like the newer voice cast, fans new to Berserk who had not seen the previous anime series or played the games will probably not think of this as an issue.   
 
The closest thing to a spoiler I can give is that after the ending credits, there is a post credits scene which isn't much for some people, but after that is over, there is a message in clear English that says ""This is only the beginning"" meaning we will get new Berserk movies. I say its only natural with the easter eggs in previous movies, this series deserves its shot where it really shines. For those not familiar with the Berserk manga, this new trilogy is a mere fraction of what Berserk has to offer. So I hope we hear more news soon if a new Berserk movie will come out this year or not.  
 
After that, we get a bonus music video!!! So fans will most likely enjoy this.

    Black lagoon is pretty close to rank a masterpiece in my taste. 
 
The only problem I can really think off is the fact that it's too short. Also a certain arc where things took a turn into mainstream anime a little too much ( when all the mercenaries showed up with f-ed up powers). 
 
 I love Black Lagoon because it isnt like any other anime. It plays by it's own rules and the rules of this show is gunslinging. People shoot eachother, and that's about it. It's completely flabbergastingly awesome firefights. They are good at shooting eachother, but because it is based around humans who die when a bullet split their cranium, it feels like it never sails away into a level where it get's out off hand. Which is the cause with almost every anime. If you dont enjoy black lagoon, something is wrong with you. Because it's just so damn good!  
 
You may find nitpicks here and there and certain episodes you didnt enjoy, I can think off a few, but you forget them, because the rest are way to immersive. Enjoy it! BTW, watch it in dubs, it gives it an international feel.

    If you are like me, you're someone who likes to watch anime series in chronological order (I mean what is up with the monogatari series?). 
 
At the time of this review, A Certain Magical Index Season 1 and 2 as well as A Certain Scientific Railgun Season 1 and 2, are complete and A Certain Magical Index: The Movie has been released. A Certain Magical Index Season 3 is currently airing and we are anxiously awaiting A Certain Scientific Accelerator in 2019. My review and Chronological Timeline encompasses the entirety of the anime series as of this point. Please enjoy! 
 
Story 8 
 
The are some very interesting and fun concepts being played with here. There are a lot of layers and even at this point still have many questions and side stories that can develop. But, it is these concepts that are given to us without any further exploration that limits the amount of depth. Some 2-3 episode OVAs involving different supporting characters would work great for this, alas unless this happens, the story leaves me wanting. 
 
Art 8 
 
The art and animation is on par with what one would expect from a serial anime TV series. There are no disappointments. At times there are some definite wallpaper screenshots, but call me spoiled after 30 years of watching anime. It's not great, but it's pretty good. 
 
Sound 9 
 
The music is on point. Intro/Outro is ear candy. Touma's ability sound effect does some magical things to me. 
 
Character 7 
 
Take all of the characters out, choose any random Shounen Harem and insert the characters. Will you notice a difference? Eh...

I binged both Index seasons back to back and was late to work a few days for staying up too late. I hated it! 0o

This series has given me several hours of enjoyment. I didn't really hate it. I really look forward to the new season and more. I really wish we could go a bit more in depth, but I'd definitely watch again.

    I'm writing this review solely to offer a different opinion for someone deciding whether to watch it based on the reviews here, as most I've seen are painting a negative picture. I dived into season 2 expecting the worst sequel ever, because everyone, everywhere (not just here) was saying how bad it was, however I was still curious to see how Akane develops so I gave it a shot, and it ended up being not at all as crappy as everyone was making it out to be. Sure yeah, there's no Kogami, which is apparently the biggest flaw for most people, but it didn't bother me at all. Everyone disliked the new villain, but again - didn't bother me at all, I actually liked him. The story was confusing sometimes, in sense that all the antagonists and their accomplices had really unbelievable motivations (but I had that same problem with season 1, Makishima included,so I forgive it) and Sybil's actions are stupid as f**k, but in the end it kept me entertained and I honestly enjoyed it. I do mind the lack of focus on Gino, but my opinion is that this season completely focused on Akane and her development, therefore it lacked focus on other characters and aspects of story, but I'm ok with that. All in all, my advice is to give it a shot and decide for yourself how much it lack compared to the previous season.

           Riding the wave of virtual world turned reality shows comes Hai no Gensou no Grimgar. It follows the typical tropes seen in these types of shows such as .hack// and SAO, but with a few twists. What differentiates it is it's art style, grounded storytelling, and patient pace.  
 
      The story sits around average. It puts a lot of work into building a unique atmosphere that blends very well with the art style and bringing a distinctly grounded feeling to a fantastical world. The story takes a backseat to the world, it bringing nothing you haven't seen before and predictable twists that leave a minimal emotional impact. The pacing is also slow, almost painfully so at times. 
      The writing very hit or miss, it nails most tender moments, but completely fails when it comes to humor. It's one of those shows that mistakes boobs at inappropriate times for humor and is devoid of almost any other type of joke. Which is a shame, because I feel some decent jokes could take this show to the next level. 
 
       Hai to Gensou no Grimgar shines aesthetically, it's gorgeous. I decided to check it out because of this: I was intrigued by the airy, watercolor art direction they went with. The animation is excellent as well. I went into the show not expecting to get past the first few episodes, but found myself rewinding because something caught my eye and I needed to see it happen again. Battle sequences are plenty and full of life, the not as flashy bits also treated with care that screams budget. Sure, the pacing was admittedly slow, but I could deal with it when everything was just so nice to look at.  
 
       The sound was not very memorable, but it fit the atmosphere of the show well. Lots of well produced insert songs are featured, but none of them shouted I need this on my ipod and most were accompanied by montages that drained my excitement more often than not.  
 
     The characters are, to be blunt, a bit shallow. They're very tropey with clear archetypes they rarely deviate from, if at all. They were likable for the most part though. I grew quite attached to a few of them and found others vaguely annoying, but we get to know them. Most of the show is devoted to showcasing the main casts' personal growth and interactions together as a group.  
The characters were all very distinct and complimented each other well. They felt truly alive when they were all bickering together and going about their business. Sadly, I couldn't find myself to care about them individually, especially the protag. The protag is bland as all heck. The characters I did feel a connection to, weren't explored enough outside of group shenanigans and cliche moments.  
 
      Despite it's flaws, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar delivers a unique experience that kept me coming back every week. The world is simply charming and makes even its lesser aspects glow.

    The plotline is simple. 12 Warriors assigned a Chinese Zodiac: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar enter a battle Royale contest. The winner gets whatever they wish for fulfilled.  
 
It's tough for me to explain exactly why I like Junni Taisen. The show not perfect my any means of the word. The animation changes and then takes a dip in later episodes. The plotline, although interesting, is nothing to write home about. Most of the story is moved forward by the characters. But because of the nature of the Battle Royale, we don't get to spend time long enough to develop feelings of attachment. By the time we get attached to a character, it's time to move on to the next character.  
 
But for all of its flaws, there's something special about Junni Taisen. It's a total turn your brain off, battle royal that you can watch without putting much thought into. And in that category, it doesn't just succeed but thrives. I know sometimes I don't want to think about the themes. I just want to see two characters box it out. If you want to watch a bunch of characters fight without much thought. This is the totally the anime for you.

    This movie was more than I expected hhahaha 
 
Story 9/10: 
The story is simply great and original! I´ve never seen a movie where descendents of a old samurai family tried to fight against an AI trought the internet hahahah. 
Why not a 10/10? the last 30 minutes where really weird in terms how things in-world worked. At some point it was pretty absurd (I know this is sci-fi but still made me feel weird hahah) 
 
Art 10/10: 
The animation was AMAZING in action scenes and even in normal and slow scenes, I loved it. 
The art style is precious too, the sky and backgrounds really settle the place. (I wanted to go to a rural house!) 
 
Sound 6/10: 
To be honest, I didnt paid much attention, but I can still say it was at least fair hahaha. Maybe in a rewatch my opinion will change this. 
 
Character 8/10: 
I loved all of them, especialy as a family. And they where a LOT.  
The main character is easily lovable and the grandma too. The only one I felt it was undeveloped was Natsuki but anyways, not everyone can win, right? hahah 
My favourite so far was Kazuma (I mean, he started learning <martial arts> because he was bullied? thats freaking awesome.) 
 
Enjoyment 10/10: 
I loved this movie, the theme of AI, hacking and tech made me watch it. Even tho is not exactly what I imagine, it was equally great. I liked the mix of the technology and the traditional. Also the comedy was on point (PD: Kenji a cutie) 
 
Overall 9/10: 
Really good movie, it was really fun to watch and the premise is truly original!

    I don't often write reviews for anime, but this series pissed me off so much that I felt the burning need to write about it. 
 
The premise of Big Order is life after the apocalypse. An event known as the Great Destruction ruined the world, half of the human population was wiped out in an instant, and many hundreds of thousands continued to die after in the following strife. It all happened because the wishes and supernatural powers (known in this anime as Orders) of a single man, Hoshimia Eiji. 
 
In the world that survives after the Great Destructiion, Eiji lives a quiet life with his sister. Eiji spends his time hiding from the world, for if the survivors learned of his part in the world ending, surely something horrible would befall him, or his sickly sister. However, when his sister is one day kidnapped, Eiji is drawn into a plot that will change the world. 
 
On paper, the introduction is good. This anime gets even better in the first four episodes where the focus is on world domination starting from a single country. It can be viewed as one giant strategy game. But the writers decide to drop this interesting story in favour of a plot driven by trite sister complex garbage, and shoe horned pseudo philosophy. 
 
While the story is garbage, at least this anime is very pretty to look at. Like with Future Diary, the art blends more traditional animation styles with 3D CG effects when any Order (people with special powers) use their abilities. Again, very similar to Future Diary in that regard. 
 
This series has pretty introductions and endings. The opening theme grew on me a little as the show went on and certainly fits the setting of the show. ""Disorder"". by Yui, is still a pretty horrible song, aiming for a heavy rock theme with plenty of synthesized voice effects, but at least the lyrics work. I cannot talk about the ending theme because it was so bad I never fully watched it all the way through. The insert music for this show is pretty good, however. Especially the battle music in the first four episodes. However, while this show has quite a bit of alright music, almost none of it is memorable. 
 
Characters are very hit and miss. The one defining character trait for our hero is ""SENA!"". Seriously, anything this guy does he only does to make his sister happy. Expect to see this play heavily into how the show ends. Sena herself seems like she could have been an interesting character had she been given more screen time that went beyond her being a stereotypical soft spoken female character who does little to anything. She does have one or two interesting scenes where we see how cunning she can be, but that gets dropped in a hurry. We also have a yandere chick with a sword, Yuno Gas -- I mean, Rin, who the writers largely forget about after the first half of the series. Rin's motivation is to kill Eiji for causing her parents to die when the world ended, but as she spends more time with Eiji she starts to show some form of inner conflict regarding this, which is never fully explored until the writers decide to force the issue over the span of three minutes in the last episode. There are a few other interesting characters, but its hard to get excited about anybody in this show after the first half. 
 
All told, I would rate this anime as a skip. This show had huge initial potential, but Big Order fails to deliver in a big way.

    The first season of Mob Psycho 100 was very good. It introduced Mob, Reigen and all the other characters to the audience, and did so in a way that helped the audience sympathise with and like them. Everything about the anime from the art style to the plot itself helped the reader understand and care about the characters; nearly all of them apart from Mob. 
 
In the second season of Mob Psycho 100, we get to watch Mob develop as a character - from a blank slate overpowered nobody into a young man with his own ideals and personality. Mob finally becomes someone, and although we had to wait a whole season (and a few episodes on top of that), it was definitely, definitely worth it. 
 
Mob Psycho 100 II places a heavier focus on the personal lives of our two main characters: Mob and Reigen. We actually get to understand Reigen, and the reasons why he does what he does.

    Plot/Story: 8/10 I really loved the concept of the anime. I loved the gore and I thought the Ghoul's looked so badass. The plot isn't slow. It goes by pretty fast so you have to pay attention. It's not a masterpiece, but it's still pretty good. The ending was not satisfying. That's why you have to read the manga to see what happens. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Art: 10/10 REALLY good art. The animators did a good job with the gore scenes. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sound: 10/10 The sub is really good. The dub is good. Not great, but good. I would recommend the dub as well as the sub version. The soundtrack is awesome. I adore it.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Characters: 7/10 The character development was on fleek. Kaneki turned from a whiny little bitch to a badass character. The mask that he wore was the coolest thing ever. He's the only character that I personally think had a significant character development in the anime and the manga. The other characters are cool too. But Kaneki though. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Overall: 7/10 It could've been better. I feel like Kaneki should've been stronger. Of course he gets even stronger in the manga. The anime was just lacking. There just should've been more detail and explanations. But it was a good watch.

    I used to be a Pokemon fanatic, as many youngsters did, but unlike everyone else I probably saw this movie for the first time in 2001 because I jumped the bandwagon later than everyone else. I remember very little about watching it, but I do remember that, in contrast to the series, it was exceptionally dark and very sad. 
 
Let's put some perspective here: the movie, in the English dub, opens up with Mewtwo coming out of some cloned form of hibernation (which is strange for a children's movie) and it's assumed that he's absolutely pissed off that he's been cloned and what-not. So he proceeds to kill everyone in the laboratory.  
 
You read that right... the movie STARTS with Mewtwo killing a bunch of scientists contracted by evildoer Giovanni to 'create' the strongest Pokemon of all time. That's not Mewtwo knocking people all over the place, but Mewtwo actually murdering people. As in, they're dead after that scene. How do I know? Explosions and shit. Epic ones. That's the only spoiler you get, I promise. 
 
I decided to rewatch it earlier today while I had about an hour to spare but was around people and suddenly realized that it had been seven years and I was going to be emotional about it for whatever reason. Whether it's the fact that it's seven years gone and so much has change or the fact that it's genuinely sad movie I almost cried several times throughout.  
 
At the climax of the movie shit starts happening and when shit starts happening shit goes down. Let's just say that I'm a fairly strong guy (that's right, guy) and I pride myself on never getting sad. I've seen people die in horrible ways, I've watched close relatives become nothing in hospital beds over a matter of weeks and then die. This hit me more. I realize how strange that sounds. 
 
But as I said, the climax of the movie is really the point where they try to get you, even as an adult, to cry. And they almost did it. It's very very very heartwrenching and again I dunno whether it's that I hadn't watched it in seven years, whether I'm a pussy, or whether it's actually that sad. Leaning towards the first two though. 
 
If you've never watched this movie you're horribly behind, but other than that it's still fresh. It's been ten years since it hit theaters in the US (I'm pretty sure, but I wasn't a fan back then) and it feels as good now as it did on my first time watching it. I'm sure others have duly noted that the comedy found throughout the series (to this point) is pretty much stripped and this movie is all about seriousness, sadness, and... moral issues. Not to say that's a bad thing, it's definitely still a good movie. 
 
If you're going back, expect this one to be a shocker. The closest I've gotten to a Pokemon movie being this shocking is the one about those two Lugia-like Pokemon from generation III which I never paid any attention to. Now let me say at least one more time that you will probably be shocked if you haven't seen it before, but probably in a good way. 
 
Story is an 8/10 because it just puts you in a lab (since the dub apparently cut off 15 minutes of things that would be ""shocking"" to western viewers) and boom the movie is going, art is 10/10 because it's basically a more glossed and shiny version of the normal series, the sound is a 10/10 because the soundtrack matches the moods throughout the film, including the climactic moments, the character is 5/10 because the characters have no development and often fail to act like themselves, and the enjoyment factor is an 8/10 because it's enjoyable but serious and sad. Overall score is an 8/10, definitely worth watching if you can deal with the kiddie themes, since this movie was for younger western audiences... which is pretty gay if you ask me.

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread) 
 
Everybody has a weakness. This may be physically or psychologically. For some people, they try to cure this weakness to make themselves a stronger person. In Mayo Chiki, Jirou tries to do just this with the aide of the lady butler Subaru and her mistress Kanade. What we are left with is a fun show without much substance. 
 
STORY 
 
The story revolves around Jirou, a high school boy who has the worst case of gynophobia (fear of women) ever. One day at school, he discovers the secret of Subaru the boy butler -- he is actually a she in disguise. In order to keep this a secret, Subaru and her mistress Kanade decide to help him overcome his weakness. 
 
First off, the show is very sexual in its content, more so than I knew going in. Almost every joke and situation has sexual connotations attached to them. Meaning, the show is probably best for an older audience. 
That being said, I thought the comedy was fun. Many of the gags repeat themselves more than once over the course of the show, but I always found myself laughing at them. 
 
Besides the comedy, romance is also a major part. I found the romance elements to be fine for what they were. It is gradual but ends on an unsatisfying note. This is because not only is the show left completely open-ended, but the final episode of the show does not continue at all from where the second-to-last one left off. Meaning, the actual ending for the anime adaptation is really bad. This is unfortunate, but something that appears to have been unavoidable. 
 
As for the rest of the story elements, they were oddly placed in. Many things that are introduced are either immediately resolved or touched on for an episode and pretty much forgotten. Off of the top of my head, this includes things such as Subaru's weakness and Jirou's father. With this in mind, the writing for the plot itself can be described as bad. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
The shows art is fine for its time period. Nothing flashy but nothing bad either. It is just another generic looking anime. 
The character designs are fine as well. 
 
The actual animation was, again, fine. They don't go out of their way to showcase their skills, but the character movements and some of the fighting scenes were animated satisfactorily. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
To be honest, I actually enjoyed Jirou (the MC), Subaru (the female lead/butler), and Kanade (butler's mistress). 
 
Jirou was interesting mainly due to his gynophobia and general awareness. He wasn't a dumb MC by any means, and his phobia allowed for some interesting scenarios. I wish they would have explored his character a bit more than they did, but for this type of show, I guess what I got should have been expected. 
 
The same goes for Subaru. Being a girl dressed/perceived as a boy is unique in a lot of ways. This allowed for funny characterization and enjoyable misunderstandings. Again, small character development is present but not enough to truly care about the character. 
 
Finally, with Kanade, I mainly found her to my liking because she was the smartest. That is to say, she moved all of the events along mainly due to her families power. Plus, because she is very confident in herself throughout all of the show, she pretty much dictates how the characters will act or go about their business. She provides a sense of direction that was probably needed for the show itself. Besides that, I enjoyed her character a lot, simply because she had no qualms with constantly teasing everybody to no end. 
 
My gripe with them is that this is mainly it. They have their schtick and they stick with it for the entirety of the show. Granted, they wouldn't be the characters they are without them, but I would have liked to have seen some growth in one way or another out of any of them. 
 
Besides these three, I found the other minor characters to be fine with the exceptions of Nakuru (the glasses loving girl) and Nagare (Subaru's father). Those two were pretty annoying and I kind of hated their characters. 
 
SOUND 
 
For me, the OP and ED are too generic. In other words, they are not good. Forgetful and non-catchy is not a good mix. 
 
I will say, one of the pieces of comedy that the show liked to use was the ""music drop"". Meaning, when sappy music is playing only to suddenly cut short for comedic effect. Surprisingly, this worked on me almost every time. Perhaps it is just easy to get a laugh out of me, but I liked the way in which they ""music dropped"" almost every single episode. 
 
As for the voice acting, I thought everyone was appropriate in their roles, with no outstanding performances. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
I actually really liked this anime. I found myself laughing all the time, even if many of the sexual jokes were reused over and over. I would always found myself smiling when Kanade was teasing Jirou to no end or when Kureha was fawning over Subaru. The comedy it presented was nicely done and made me grin like a fool. 
 
When it comes to romance, I am a bit biased in that I love it to death. That being said, I loved the romance elements. I liked how shy Subaru would get around Jirou or how Usami played a nice tsundere character. It's not the best romance in anime, but it serves its purpose nicely enough. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Bad, all over the place with shoddy ending 
 
Animation: Fine, serves its purpose 
 
Characters: Fine, start unique but fall flat 
 
Sound: Fine, OP and ED are no good but OST is somewhat good in context 
 
Enjoyment: Great, lots of laughs and nice romance aspects 
 
Final Score: 5/10

    “Kyoukai No Kanata” or “Beyond The Boundary” is the successor  of haruhi Suzumiya  the huge hit that kyoto animation brought to the anime industry,  though it never lived to that example as kyoani has less experience when dealing with supernatural anime. Typically, they tend to make Moe slice of life but they adapted a supernatural light novel. the anime is based on the novel by the same name written by Torii nagomu and illustrated by Kamoi Tomoyo. 
 
Youmu are spirits that roam the city, They are the manifestation of human negative emotions as stated in the synopsis though we never get to see them through the whole series it never feels that Hunting Down those creatures is the main highlight of the show. Walking through the first episode we meet Akihito Kanbara our main protagonist who stumble upon a girl who is about to throw herself from the school rooftop, Never to realise that this character will change his life .   
 
The settings is our modern world as our main character Mirai struggles with her dark past, blaming herself for the death of her childhood friend, uses the power to manipulate  her blood at will. I found this character  so bland and basic,you got your typical highschool girl with uninteresting yet childish personality, she has the ultimate rival sakura yui’s sister who swore vengeance for her long lost sister, Then we have akahito the half-human half-youmu who has a fetish for beautiful girls with glasses (That level of creativity though). because that’s the only thing that stands out from his personality, and we have our supporting cast. Hiromi who has imouto syndrome, and his sister the one with strong personality. They together join the literature  club (yeah they had to join a club). to complete your typical school anime That Destroyed the Interesting premise and replaced it with a school anime with perverts, cliches, uninteresting characters and a comedy that in most cases seems misplaced and simply out of place. Not to mention that Filler episode with the dance ughhhh… 
 
Animation and art wise the show is masterfully animated with a lot of sakuga moments, This was the turning point for me it was so pleasant to watch such animation. I am a big fan of kyoani and their moelike character designs so that’s another thing i enjoyed. Overall the show was aesthetics over substance. It was filled with boring moments uninteresting dialogue and catchphrases that kept me Waiting for that character to disappear. Also the sound was great, awesome OST with great emotional value. Never skipped the opening and ending credits they were so good. 
 
Overall i feel this anime is just a show about cool animation and aesthetics i never cared about the characters or the plot it’s just Sakuga the anime. So yeah the score is just for the animation and sound and My devotion to Kyoani.

    Another series pretty much overhyped by this site and everyone. 
 
Like 12 kingdoms it spends a bit too much time on politics at points. It cant decide whether it wants to be a strategy, tactics, military, political or character driven show. Pretty much the entire episodes up until a certain point are filler and are replaced by the movie. The rest seems to be a slow built up until the two sides coincide. And while this does occur, it seems to be less tactical and more ""who shoots first wins"". 
 
All in all it was good but not great enough. I was expecting something about code geass/death note on the ""one upping"" scale and did not get much in that regard. I did enjoy the small sections of the spacemen using axes against soldiers which I found humorous.  
 
Too many star wars references.

    Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai also known as AnoHana is a anime which explores the theme friendship. Friends are something that can be viewed in various ways and in this story we see the deep side of friendship. Inocence,Friends,Regret,Chance,Exploring life,Memories and Moving on are words that can describe AnoHana. 
 
Story: 9 - This story is about a 15 year-old guy named Jinta Yadomi who became a Hikikomori ( Shut-In ) after an incident that occured in his childhood with his friends which he believes happened because of him. And now he is forced to confront his reality in which he can only move on if he unites with his friends. The plot is quite different because drama's that surround high-school kids are usually romanctic dramas which this isn't, so this was an original concept with a nice blend of different genres. 
 
Art: 8 - The art was quite simple yet clear which is a nice thing, but it doesn't particularly stand out or make me think that it's 'wonderful' or 'unique'. A notable thing about the art would be the charcters movements which were quite smooth and that is proof of good quality art. 
 
Sound: 8 - The sound fitted in well with none being out of place. The OST's created a warm and calm yet somewhat painful atmosphere when needed. The opening and ending songs were nice as well with the ending song giving a warm atmosphere while the opening gives out a refreshing feeling. The voice actors also did a nice job in potraying the right atmosphere with the characters. 
 
Character: 8 - The characters behaviour's were realistic but somewhat stereotypical. A good thing about the characters is that the all of the protagonists have different personalities which changes a lot of things in the story. It should also be noted that this anime relies heavily on characters as their personality and behaviour are the things that influence the story's situation and progression. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 - I enjoyed this series due to its different nature and approach towards friendship in a refreshing manner. And this series manages to pull in viewers inside its story despite having only 11 episodes as well as being a original story  is a amazing achievement. People who like the Drama,Slice of Life animes like Angel Beats,Kokoro Connect,Clannad will enjoy this series. 
 
Overall: 8 - Overall it was a nice watch and is recommended to almost anyone if you can watch a sad story.

    Pretty good... not a masterpiece, not as bad as some people think.... worth a watch if you've got a free slot. 
As I've gotten a little bit older I've fond it hard to relate to character in some rom-com anime's. Sometimes the characters are just too young or too immature or me to relate too. That's why I was pretty excited to start watching Golden Time, I was hoping that this would be something I could relate to. Was it? Yes and NO. 
Plot: The plot was pretty complected but I don't think I was invested enough to get any pay off from the ending.... also...... its not spoilers because its in the plot summary but seriously ...amnesia?? 
Characters: I love it when characters develop and change throughout the course of the show, and in some ways these characters did and in some ways they didn't. Kouko is the character that I felt changed the most, for me she was the main character, not Banri. When you first meet her she is pretty annoying but over time you she her less as an annoying stalker girl and more as a realistic girl who is very determined to not loose her happy ending .. and who can blame her, who would honestly have their happy ending right in front of them and not grasp it with both hands. That is one huge positive I will say for these characters, boy are they pro-active. They don't sit around and wait for the person they like to appear, or pray for a miracle, they go and they make it happen.  
I'm not saying its a masterpiece, but i Did find some episodes enjoyable, especially the early ones, in my opinion its worth giving it a shot.

    I found it curious that a movie about the love parents have for their children would start off with a promise that such love would inevitably be lost. Maquia is very insistent on this. It is written into the premise of the movie, about how an immortal, elf-like woman tries to raise her non-immortal, very human son. This promise is repeated throughout the movie, so much so that you’d think it really was only a matter of time before she would be separated from her son. And yet, somehow, this movie is not a tragedy. Though it is mired by its frequent narrative missteps, Maquia is perhaps one of the most profound reflections on parenthood and responsibility I have ever seen. 
 
Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms, Mari Okada’s directorial debut, follows Maquia, a mythical, ageless being, after she rescues a baby, Ariel, and raises him as her own. It chronicles their lives as Maquia adjusts to the outside world and learns how to provide for her newborn son. Much (honestly, all) of the draw of this movie involves Maquia and Ariel’s journey across foreign lands, their bond together as mother and son, and what we can learn from how it changes over time and circumstance.  
 
And to its credit, Maquia’s chronicle of parenthood is told with surprising acuity. Maquia’s early days of raising a baby on a farm are replete with the simple joys of parenting itself. Seeing Ariel walk for the first time, or being there to hear his first words—to Maquia the movie, these are joys worth sharing, milestones in parenthood that feel like their own reward. But parenting is not just some babysitting here and there. Maquia the movie does not shy away from the uncomfortable realities of being a working parent and its newfound emotional and economic toll. A forced relocation turns into a financial disaster, with Maquia struggling to make ends meet. At home, Ariel is uncooperative, and lacks the maturity and understanding to support his mother when she’s down. Maquia the movie shows an incisiveness to parenting that feels as if it was drawn from Mari Okada’s own experience with motherhood herself, and it is certainly all the more convincing for it. 
 
Adding to Maquia’s strengths is how it sells itself as a powerful and moving film, and everything from the sophistication of its production to its loving journey of a mother and her son would speak as such. This is because Maquia is adept at keeping the “texture” of its drama intact. In its big moments, everything feels the way it should. Its ideas of parenthood and love are (supposedly) universal. Its animation is fluid, and the various subtleties of each character’s emotional states are expressed in thoroughly convincing detail. The soundtrack that plays during key moments between Maquia and her son may be one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard.  
 
And that, on a basic level, is about where the strengths of this story end. Maquia the movie prides itself on being an important, heartfelt drama, but much of this drama either doesn’t land, doesn’t make sense, or both. The things these characters are saying are just too unnatural, too out of touch, too focused on some heightened dramatic reality where children swearing they will grow up to “protect” their parents (from… what, exactly?) makes those parents break down in tears. And it’s telling how blunt some of the drama is that I was rarely left with the sense that anything substantial was actually said during what should have been key moments of catharsis.  
 
Then there are the pacing issues. The frequent timeskips create tonal disconnects where characters we thought we knew spontaneously change, some for seemingly no reason. It takes active effort, as a viewer, to readjust to people behaving in ways that seem incongruent with how we have seen them only moments prior, even if the movie has some ostensible reason to do so to reflect how people change through the passage of time. One minute we see Ariel reconciling with Maquia after the stress of being a parent becomes too much for her to bear. The next minute, he’s… avoiding her? With no explanation? And then it happens again, a few scenes later? Where is the movie going with this? And what’s a Hibiol, again? 
 
And yet, this is still a movie worth applauding. Maquia is not just a drama about the trials a mother goes through in raising her son. If that’s all this movie had going for it, I would not be writing this review. Because Maquia does not just chronicle the relationship between a mother and her child. Maquia charts Ariel’s growth over his entire lifespan, from early childhood to teenage development to independence in his adult years. Suddenly, Ariel is leaving the house, he’s getting married, he’s expecting his own baby. And suddenly, you realise Maquia isn’t just about someone figuring out how to be a parent—it’s about the nature of parenting itself. 
 
The promises of parenthood are never what we expect. There is no guidebook, no instructions, no steps on parenting that teach us how to treat our children right. Being a mother is something Maquia learns only as she does it, where she has to both realise what her mistakes are and fix them, all on her own. We are constantly reminded of the lingering doubt in her mind if she has actually been a good parent at all. And as Ariel matures, new problems arise. As he grows older, he is no longer the naïve, dependent child he once used to be. But Maquia continues treating him as such, her good will getting in the way of being a good mother because she is parenting in the only way she knows how.  
 
Which was why I found it so curious this movie would insist that Maquia losing Ariel was all but inevitable. Because it’s true. Maquia does not stay with Ariel forever. This movie makes it a point to show Ariel beginning his own life as an adult, now as a husband, and a soon-to-be father of his own. The childhood innocence Maquia once saw in Ariel is lost as he grows older, and in its place is the same sense of maturity and responsibility Maquia had to learn as she was raising him. People grow, and people change, and Maquia the movie posits that, sometimes, that change is irreconcilable with the past. The idea that familial love is unconditional and forever is incompatible with this movie, where Ariel’s relationship with Maquia grows ever more strained as he matures into adulthood and becomes increasingly independent, and as he comes to terms with his own unique responsibilities that arise from it. Instead, Maquia the movie is about accepting how our children will one day grow beyond us, and how they will come to value the efforts and sacrifices they made for their children as we did for them. 
 
I don’t know if this is a good movie, but I do know it is ahead of its time. The script itself feels amateurish, and what should have been powerful and moving drama was let down by characters talking in ways that meant nothing of substance and carried little meaningful dramatic weight. It has pacing issues, tonal issues, and is full of confusing narrative ideas—some which work, and some that absolutely do not. And yet, I have never seen a movie that makes such profound statements on the nature of parenthood, and the courage of those who undertake it. Maquia is a movie that cares deeply about what being a parent really means, a movie that understands how our children will not always stay with us, and how they will grow up and learn to take on the same mantle we took on for them. As a character drama, this movie is riddled with missteps and questionable narrative choices. But as a reflection of parenthood? As an affirmation of everything that makes parenting worthwhile? It is a triumph. Sometimes, being a parent is about being there for them when it matters, and to love and nurture them all the while. And sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is to let them go.

    Story: 
The story is more of a premise, and that premise is actually quite enjoyable. I mean, seriously. What would YOU do in a room for 15 minutes where you just had to wait? Now, this is before cell phones and internet, so you either had to sit alone or find something else. So, what would you do? 
 
Although the version I watched didn't translate the many occupations of the people, it didn't take away any of the enjoyment. I thought it was fun watching how someone pulled out a couple smokes while another literally tumbled off the chair and fell asleep. There's a lot you can learn about someone by watching them sit and kill some time. The things they do, in some ways, imply the things they do elsewhere. As an experiment, it's really quite neat. 
 
The reason I have the story rated as 5/10 and not something lower for a non-story such as this is because at the end I was actually a little disappointed it was over. I wanted to watch some more. Oh well. 
 
 
Art: 
Art wise, the film is just a bunch of pictures likely taken every 10 seconds and then each frame sped up real fast as we watch the people sit around. The camera never moves and all you can see is the chair and the wall. This became much more interesting as things progressed because you learned there were other things in the room outside of frame. Like, a lot of things, and that made it really cool to watch. 
 
 
Sound: 
An abstract OST that's really just a series of sounds like banging on tin cans and such. Nothing special. It's not really setting a mood, either. It's just there and unintrusive. I actually found it quite relaxing. 
 
 
Character: 
The character comes from the many people shown and there's definitely a lot of it. Everyone does different things and while it's not translated who has what profession, there's something fun about guessing who does what while watching. I think it added a little more to the experience as someone who can't read Japanese to simply guess what profession everyone had. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Much more enjoyable than I thought and while I don't think I'd watch it again anytime soon, I could see myself showing a friend since it's the sort of thing I'd go, ""Hey man check this out, it's kinda neat and almost like a time-capsule of footage on what people did while waiting before cell phones and stuff.

    Perfect Blue is one of THOSE kinds of movies. ""This movie will confuse you, I guarantee."", they said. Hearing those words, I went into the movie with my Sherlock Holmes hat, prepared to deduce every scene, study the dialogue as it goes by, and call the plot twists before they happened. I was pretty proud of myself for the first half. ""I can do this!"", I said. ""I'm way smarter than those other viewers!""  
Sadly, the smug smile I had on my face disappeared in the second half, putting my Sherlock-hat on the desk. I was beaten. 
 
Story (9/10): 
I'm a big fan of plots that can surprise me. A plot that can throw me for a loop, making me think I'm smart enough to have figured out the mystery, then smack me in the face for being a silly, stupid person, who thinks he was better than he thought he was. Perfect Blue does this with great effect.   
 
Perfect Blue has a lot of tricks up it's sleeve for the viewer. Most notably are it's excellent uses of transitions. Whenever the viewer takes a backseat, and relaxes, it will transition in an interesting way, putting the viewer in a surprised state to grab their attention. This keeps the movie interesting, even if you don't completely understand what is happening.  
 
As I mentioned before, Perfect Blue leaves you in a constant state of confusion, especially in the second half. There's a positive side to this, but also a downside. The positive side, is that the movie is great to rewatch, arguably making it better, because all those subtle hints the movie gave away, are suddenly noticed. However, when you're watching it the first time, you can't help but feel bored sometimes, when the movie starts showing you things that, at the time, you either don't get, or you don't think is important. 
 
Art (7/10): 
 
What I like about Satoshi's art, is that you clearly know how the characters would look in real life. They don't all look like supermodels, you can clearly tell who's good looking, who's average looking, and who's downright ugly. The movie has realistic character designs. 
 
Saying that though, there was something that bugged me. Although the character styles might look realistic, they weren't exactly varied. The most notable is when Mima is performing with 'CHAM'. The faces of the three members really don't have any notable variation, except for the hairstyles.  
 
Sound (6/10): 
 
The soundtrack does it's job. It adds to the scenes, and makes things a bit creepier. Saying that though, there really wasn't anything that stood out. Well, except for one track. See, there is this track in the soundtrack that actually starts out as sound effects, like a fax machine. Slowly however, the music starts to play over it, and new SFX are introduced into the tune, and when everything is added at the end, it makes for a really excellent track, that you'll have in your head for at least one night. Not that you want it in your head, because it freaks you out, and it makes it hard to sleep at night, and is there something behind me right now? 
 
The Japanese voice actors do their job well, however, since I can't speak Japanese, it's kind of hard to criticize the performance. However, I could feel the emotion when some of the intense scenes come up. 
 
Characters (8/10): 
 
Before I go talking about the main character, I'll say something about the supporting cast. At the surface, the supporting cast isn't anything special. Throughout the entire movie, most of them are only there to have conversations with Mima, and give their input. What makes the supporting cast so great though, is that you don't really know who will break through their supporting cast roles, and become important. Some may seem extremely important to the story, but in truth, they aren't. Some may seem very unimportant, but are.  
 
Now onto Mima. I wouldn't really say that Mima is a strong character at the beginning. Her motives for becoming an actress aren't really explained, and some of her decisions are questionable at best. There is a positive point to this though. By making Mima a bit of a vague character, you don't really know what she's capable of, so if she does make an important decision, you don't know what she will do. 
What makes Mima interesting though, is her psychological breakdown during the movie. A lot of the weird things that happen in the movie actually reveal part of Mima's psyche, which allows for a lot of fun analyzing.  
 
Overall (8/10): 
 
Perfect Blue is a really good movie. It has a good length, so things don't really feel dragged out, and when the confusing stuff does happen, the viewer will know that the payoff isn't too far away. If you are a bit patient with it, and can stand confusion for the sake of a strong payoff, then this movie is definitely for you. However, if you're someone who prefers a lot of action, and can't stomach disturbing scenes (this movie is definitely 18+), then you might want to pass this one up. Otherwise, I will recommend this movie.

    [8.0/10] 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Over one Billion Yen. Ten million dollars. This was the price the industry paid to create timeless animation. This was the toll Katsuhiro Otomo paid to adapt almost two thousand pages of his magnum opus. One which he struggled to finish. Every page taking more time than the last. Each penstroke weighing heavier on his hand. All culminating in a dinner with Alejandro Jodorowsky, director of El Topo and The Holy Mountain, as he was coming off the heels of Sante Sangre. The dinner is what eventually made Otomo close the final chapter to Akira.  
 
Yet this was two years after the release of the film. Two years after Kaneda's cardinal motorbike was brought to life. Screeching tires were given more frames, plumes of smoke began to move, a sound was given to still images. Otomo didn't stop there. There was no use for mere adaptation, a recreation, a facade of the real thing. He wanted to bring something original to the medium. That billion yen he pocketed was to be used. Don't cut away from the animation, don't hide the imperfections. Improve upon them.  
 
738 pages of design were turned into over two hours of entertainment. The actors brought in didn't lip sync. That wasn't what Akira was going to be. Established norms in the industry were of no concern. Otomo was here to transgress. Pre-scored dialogue was utilized. Actors offered their full range of emotions, not just what was required for their voices to match the already animated characters. The entire film was made around that. Characters were drawn to match the actors. A symbiotic relationship between artist and art.  
 
160,000 cells. Each one reliant on the last to complete the cut. Kaneda walks to his bike. Tetsuo grasps his capsules, as a reference to his now-defunct gang and the drugs in hand. Kinetic blasts of telekinesis showcased in smooth effects animation crack the pavement. A soundtrack by an entire collective, music that literally breathes with the film. A panting, tired chorus back-ends tension, carnivalesque, chirping vocals sting during the climax. It's all symbiotic. The sound director, Shoji Yamashiro intercut the same song cycle throughout the entire film. Each layer of the music adding on to one another creating cacophony during the third act.  
 
Hundreds of cuts within a narrative that folds in on itself. Fades linger, yet never overstay their welcome. It's brisk, not simply to adapt the long source, but to convey a mood. The tension doesn't melt because there is no time for it too. The bike doesn't slow down, so neither should you. From one scene to the next, from laser beams to jail cells. It's all as fluid as the animation. Each cut is purposeful, the lingering fades, paused, still, like reminders from a turning page. The last glimpse of a moment in the past.  Seyama's editing persists through continuity, broken only once to outline an abrupt meeting. 
 
Take a backseat to Tetsuo and his best friend Kenada. During a usual gang conflict, Tetsuo has a chance run-in with an esper boy. Explosions, gunfire, and the military descend upon them and take Tetsuo with the boy esper. From there, Tetsuo discovers his own innate powers. Ones which he uses to rebel further, to finally take a stand for himself. He becomes a figure for the people, the same ones that want to so vigorously fight against the norm but their strength is limited. He represents the outlook of many, both fictional and real. Tetsuo finds himself, a physically weak boy always protected by his best friend, lost. Lost in the rebellion, the reform, the need to be who he wants to be without understanding the true cause of his innate desire.  
 
Aesthetic sensibility may be subjective, but aesthetic influence is not. Akira's palette is dusky, old, and cracking. The city has spots of neon, the lights are bright, yet the story that's told isn't. We follow roaming gangs, we follow Kaneda, Tetsuo, bikers, dealers. Through delinquent schools that are of no meaning, relationships that exist from necessity, carnal desires that eat away at a society still unrecovered from the trauma of the past. The Akira. A gleaming, blinding eruption that destroyed the entirety of Tokyo, yet spurred life that forever exists as a shadow of what it was. The city of Neo-Tokyo is filled with people remembering the past. Remembering what was. Ignoring the present. Hoping for the future. Hoping for another Akira, hoping for anything, physical or not, to change their lives again.  
 
Parallels to Hiroshima and Nagasaki are common in Japanese entertainment. The post-bomb society of Neo-Tokyo is a grim reminder that while many may like to forget, their every move is motivated as an expression of rebellion against the past. This society is a reflection of the truth behind the false visage put up by Japan. These bikers, the ones that fight and kill each other aren't of major concern to the police. This is a common facet of this society. The old city looms, both literally and metaphorically. People riot for tax reform yet the change never comes. Dystopia, cyberpunk sensibilities, these are elements prevalent in so much sci-fi, yet in Akira's case, birthed from a culture not afraid of these changes, but familiar with them. 
 
Now we look forward. The timelessness of classic, 2D animation is on display. While Akira may have been an immensely expensive product and heavy risk for Japan at the time, it was one that so easily paid off by not looking dated whatsoever. Undoubtedly within the late-80s aesthetic, Akira breaks the notion that ""old can't hold"". Easily comparable to the aesthetic achievements of 2001: A Space Odyssey, not simply due to audacity and success, but due to the methods employed not being remotely commonplace. Yet, much like so many revolutionary products at the time, Akira struggled for recognition. Both in terms of viewers and appreciation.  
 
""Unmarketable to the west."" Spoken without vision, without an eye for achievement. Who else but Steven Spielberg, a visionary creator behind some of the most beloved films of all time, to say such insipid and close-minded remarks. Such an astounding, inspirational name incapable of recognizing originality and non-insular creation. Spielberg, of course, paid recompense for such remarks, not through apology but through homage. Blatant as can be. From unmarketable to marketing, Kenada's signature bike features alongside Spielberg's blockbuster, Ready Player One, in one of the most titular and exhilarating action scenes of the year. That's enough, Steven, apology accepted.  
 
Inception, The Matrix, Chronicle, Stranger Things, all products of Akira. Each one borrowing, with love, to create their own deviations from the film. Each element taken is another expanded upon. From simple homages, such as Kanye West's ""Stronger"", to creating entire characters based on the concept, with Stranger Things. It's not that it wasn't marketable, it's that the market took time to recognize. So's the forever churning gears of inspiration, a budding seed to a bursting cacoon.  
 
Take one step into an art piece inspired by many that inspires many. That's the beauty of entertainment. Kubrick may hold responsibility for some Akira, much like Otomo holds responsibility for some Midnight Special. The world design makes up for the character design, the meta-narrative makes up for the base narrative. It's the images that stick with you, the idea that style is somehow lapped by substance is ignorant. Style, in this case, is the substance. It's images that eat away at your thoughts. A bulbous, disfigured, horrific amalgamation of flesh and wires that acts like fertilizer to the roots of creatives and their eventual ideas. If there is anything to love Akira for, it's that.

    I am about to give a positive review to the least-liked season of Sailor Moon. No, I am not smoking anything and I did not just escape from a mental facility. I truly love this arc, and watch it frequently.  
Story: The story is, I'll grant not as involved as the other arcs. And the fact that we know Chibi Usa has Pegasus right off the bat kills some of the suspense. SuperS is often criticized for being too light and cutesy. But even though most of the episodes are filler, as with the rest of Sailor Moon, they are rarely boring. It is lighter, but we just had S, arguably the darkest season in the series, and we're about to get into Stars, which is also very heavy on the angst. SuperS is a welcome intermission. Some of the episodes are very funny, such as when Usagi stalks Rei and Mamoru as the red ninja of love, or when Minako dates two of the villains simultaneously. I also like that it focuses on Chibi Usa, she really comes into her own. She also gets her own romance with Helios, which I think is the sweetest relationship in all of Sailor Moon. 
 
Art: I'm not a big art person. The art is I think better than the earlier seasons, but it's Sailor Moon. You don't watch it for it's animation merit.  
 
Sound: The Japanese voices are wonderful as always. The English is...yeah. Though I will say Helios' dub voice is really sexy. The score is top-notch, I think SuperS has the best music. Lots of new pieces.  
 
Character: The Inners all develop a bit, Usagi really doesn't but oh well. Chibi Usa is the one who goes through the most change, SuperS for her is like what Classic was for Usagi. And um, there's Helios, who is awesome!  
 
Enjoyment: It's fun to watch, really. I swear. 
 
Overall: I wish this season wasn't written off so much. It has some wonderful qualities. I never tire of it. I highly recommend you at least give it a try!

    Okay, first off the anime isnt finish yet so i cant really rate the story fully yet :P. 
 
 
Story: 
Well, its not the most original story in the world. Super powerful guy did something wrong in his past. Trys to go to school and be normal but doesnt end up that way, gets dragged into the military part of the school. the story deffintly isnt the strongest part of this show :P 
 
Art: 
The art is great, the character's are all drawn very well, the backgrounds are kinda plain at times but, the characters, weapons,etc are done great so you dont really care that much about the backgrounds.(And also you cant really have great background art when there are ltos of deserts). 
also the fighting is drawn really well. 
 
Sound: 
are pretty good. nothign outstanding here, you here the DITE's(weapons) clash together and whatever, you kinda feel like you here the same sounds over again at times tho. 
 
Characters: 
Is where i think the anime is best at you really get into the characters and i have yet to find someone i dont like, they are all very interesting and most have some good story to them :) 
 
Enjoyment: 
Its really fun to watch the fights see all the diffrent DITE's and it has a good amount of blood in it(for a 13+ anime). 
but i wish there was a little bit more fighting(my personal opinion) 
 
Overall: 
Great show. nothing else to really say about it. its not the most original but it still feels fresh at the same time. watch the first 3 episodes if you dont like it by then just drop it.

    Truly when speaking of a Seinen, Mature, Adult-like animes Rainbow is definitely one of the top ones. This show almost leaves no place for the comedy side of anime which I like. I prefer less comedy more seriousness and this anime delivered it to 100% The story, drama, characters, development, build up, this anime got everything, there are happy moments, there are sad moments, and as we follow these 7 individuals in a tough environment, each with different backgrounds and struggles and dreams, you start to like them one by one as they progress with their unbreakable friendship, in this anime you will see the very represenation of what True Friends Are For. I recommend it 10/10. 
 
I was literally going to cry and i dont cry for animes man this anime was so emotional.

    Hmm, what can I say? This anime really came up with something original. The humor in here was classic, with some funny situations that could only be obtained through the power of cross-dressing and gender confusion. The only problem was length, I would have liked to see the anime go a couple more episodes. 
 
8/10

    Ixion Saga DT starts off in a similar trend to a lot of the recent MMO animes. In other words: the protagonist is an MMO player (A somewhat good one or great one at that) and somehow gets intertwined within the game itself.  
 
The thing is, Ixion Saga DT doesn't really shine in any category. In terms of action, there isn't much incredible fighting nor abilities if that's what you're looking for. In terms of humor, it's generally lame slapstick and puns. Story-wise, there isn't much depth to it and the development is incredibly slow (4 episodes in and they spent an entire one on slapstick humor with a flying squirrel-like creature) and rather mediocre.  
 
The characters aren't very interesting either. You have one gamer that's almost perfectly normal with no standout qualities, one tranny that drawn moe style (Which isn't really that funny), one blockhead fighter and a princess which is a child. 
 
In other words, you're in for a rather bland anime with some lame slapstick humor and a mediocre storyline. It's like a cross between pokemon, in that they travel to different places fighting bad guys, and a try-hard version of gintama (Except gintama is actually funny in innumerable ways this series is not).

    Ah Konosuba undoubtedly one of the funniest animes ever.  With a talented cast, a great cast of characters and an interesting setting this anime is one of my favorites. I saw the first season back in 2016 and I loved it and I was glad to hear that it was getting a second season. This is one anime that I hoped will get plenty of seasons.   
 
Setting and story  
 
Like the first season the story of Konosuba follows the adventures of Kazuma a human who was killed in an accident in the real world that was awakened in a fantasy world where magic, monsters and adventurers exist thanks to meeting the goddess Aqua. After dragging Aqua to the world as well the pair encounter their new party members after putting up a notice. These being the extremely powerful mage that has only one spell Megumin and the strong crusader that also likes to be punished Darkness. Season 2 takes place straight after the events of the last episode of the first season. Like the previous season this season has several story arcs that has its own unique characters and quests/ antics.  
The first arc that the cast goes through is the arc with Sena. This arc is a direct consequence of their actions back in their first season where their actions in destroying the devil army’s weapon the destroyer resulted in them destroying a noble’s mansion when they teleported the power source of the machine into it. This arc itself was quite funny in that it involved nearly every character that Kazuma had unintentionally hurt or embarrassed in the past. The fact that Kazuma was accused of conspiring with the devil king due to this was funny as was the subsequent trial that was obviously stacked against him. This act I felt was good as it revealed not just what Aqua and the members of the party think of Kazuma but also what the members of the support cast think of him.  
 
The next arc that the cast goes through is Varnirs act.  This arc is a consequence of the previous arc in which after clearing a dungeon of enemies that dungeon become the new home of a powerful member of the Devil king’s army. This arc was notable in its main villain who though certainly powerful and deadly was more comical than dangerous. This arc was also notable in that it showed just how powerful Darkness is in combat as she was able to take on quite a few foes and still not be stopped. The interaction between Varnir and Darkness was also amusing.  
The last arc that the cast goes through and arguably the most Significant arc. As a consequence, resolving the previous arc Kazuma ends up getting into a business partnership and in the process, make a large amount of money that causes things to become slow for the party. At this point the cast decided to maybe take some time to relax and head to a nearby resort town. Of course, in true Konosuba fashion this trips turns out to be anything but relaxing. This arc had quite a few surprises that actually was pretty unexpected which made this arc one of my favourites in this season. The first was the fact that the town’s population all believed in one god which was unusual to say the least. Maybe this world only has a limited number of gods in it. The second thing was how creepy these people are when they are trying to get people to join their church. It’s certainly disturbing when you see everyone try and be nice to you while at the same time trying to get you to sign a contract. Talk about creepy salesman lol. The third thing however was how the arcs main villain who looked like a rather normal guy was anything but when he revealed himself. Now that was a impressive transformation there.  
 
All three of the story arcs for this season was pretty good in my opinion in that each of them had a unique villain that was both strong and each arc requiring the cast to work together to solve the problem that each of those arcs presented. I also liked the fact that each of these arcs are connected with one another in that the consequences of one arc is the catalyst for the start of the next arc.   
 
Kazuma  
Kazuma voiced by veteran voice actor Jun Fukushima is one of the main characters of the show and serves as the de facto leader of the main party. A simple minded, fast thinking and loyal person Kazuma often is the voice of calm within a party especially when Aqua or darkness goes on their antics. As revealed back in the first season Kazuma is not a original inhabitant of the world that he finds himself in and was in fact a 16 year old teenager that was also a shut in that was brought to this world through Aqua. Thus, Kazuma unlike other adventurers is free to allocate points to skills that he would useful rather than follow a specific class. Although this season takes place straight after the events of the first season Kazuma’s skill at various techniques is good. True to his personality Kazuma’s skills are mainly focused on stealth as with his hide ability or aids him in exploration such as his sense ability. When combat is unavoidable Kazuma adapts the use of a bow as his main offensive power. Even though his party is hard to control at times and it will perhaps be better to form a better party with others Kazuma is in fact very loyal to his friends and indeed is nice to just about everyone. Despite that he can feel stressed at times especially when dealing with the likes of Aqua and Darkness and to a lesser extent Megumin. One of Kazuma’s most impressive traits is his ability to come up with some impressive tactics when dealing with sudden situations that is borne out of his strong observational skills as well as prior knowledge. His tactics though usually unusual and sometimes strange most often do work with this seasons being the battle against the herd of monsters in the desert and the climactic battle in the last arc. Often at times I feel sorry for Kazuma as he has to both manage his party and at the same time manage their finances. I felt that Kazuma’s voice actor Jun Fukushima did a pretty good job in voicing Kazuma.  
 
Aqua  
Aqua voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Akame ga kill fame and my third favourite seiyuu is one of the main characters of the show. A goddess of water who was supposed to have been assigned the role of judging humans that were to be sent to the world where Kazuma and the others reside. This later turned sideways when Kazuma who grew tired of Aqua’s attitude dragged her along with him to the RPG world. Aqua is an energetic, inattentive and bossy that also has a goddess complex in which she likes to be revered by others. Within the story Aqua has the role of a arch mage which is a powerful type of mage that makes use of holy power that allows her to purify both the undead and objects such as water. However, unlike Kazuma whose skills do try to benefit the party Aqua spends all her points in getting party tricks true to her personality. Despite that Aqua does actively care about people and her party members which is made apparent in the first arc when she tries hard to save Kazuma from imprisonment and in the last arc where she tried saving the towns source of income despite the risks in doing so proves that while Aqua certainly can be stubborn and childish at times Aqua’s heart is certainly in the right place. One recurring gag about Aqua is her acts of badmouthing her replacement for her role of judging humans Eris usually by saying someone about her bust size compared to Aqua’s own. This always turns out to be hilarious whenever she says it. As a arch mage Aqua makes use of holy power that also has the tendency to cause trouble for the party as undead creatures will naturally be drawn to her much like how moths are drawn to light sources. It’s funny that when Aqua tries to be useful she often is the reason that the party is in trouble though. Overall, I felt that Sora Amamiya did a great job portraying Aqua.  
 
Megumin  
 
Megumin voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero fame is a mage and one of the main characters of the show. A powerful mage that specializes in the use of explosion type magic Megumin often acts as the voice of reason within the party when either Aqua or Darkness gets too worked up. Megumin’s personality can be described as both honest and caring but at the same time she can be malicious at times. However she does value the bonds and friendships that she has forged with not just the party but also with other people that she has encountered over the years like YunYun for example. Although Megumin is a powerful mage she only knows one spell which while impressive in terms of both attack power and range of impact has the comical effect of incapacitates her for the rest of the day when cast. Although Megumin clearly has the talent to learn different types of spell for some reason she doesn’t. In truth Megumin would be more useful in combat if she is able to use more different types of spells rather than being used as a one-shot weapon. In this season Megumin develops a more closer relationship with Kazuma becoming friendlier actively caring about him when he’s down. Megumin and Kazuma’s interactions have always been funny but in this season, it was even funnier. Megumin’s act of naming Kazuma’s new sword without his accent was probably the funniest. Rie Takahashi as ever did a great job portraying Megumin.  
 
Darkness  
Darkness played by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Anohana and Guilty crown fame is a crusader and one of the main characters in the series. A member of the RPG worlds crusader class which essentially serves as a party’s main tank Darkness plays an important role within the party’s combat line-up and composition. Though certainly powerful in combat this is offset by one of her traits in that she often misses her attacks even when fighting at point blank range. One notable trait of Darkness that I find amusing is the fact that she is a masochist which means that Darkness actually dreams of being punished by monsters or punished in some other way. This means that more often than not in a situation where the party have adapted a textbook formation or plan that Darkness would ruin it when this urge to be punished comes. The third arc is a good example of this.  
 
Darkness’s personal life wasn’t very much explored in the first season which was remedied in this season. It was actually quite surprising to find that she’s was actually a high-born noble that decided to become an adventurer to escape her family. Darkness’s personal life was actually the focus for one of the smaller sub arcs in the story and that was actually quite entertaining in part because Darkness and Kazuma had differing reasons and agenda’s. That was quite funny to see. Ai Kayano as usual did a great portraying Darkness.  
 
Sena  
Sena voiced by veteran seiyuu Hitomi Nabatame is a support character that was introduced near the end of the first season. A prosecutor that works for the crown Sena serves as the main villain for the first arc that the cast goes through in the anime. Unlike other villains in the series Sena isn’t doing this out of malice or ill will but rather she is doing this as part of her job. From what was seen of her personality Sena she seems to be one that hates injustice and sees her job as vital to the land. One of Sena’s most notable traits is that she has two different personalities that are actually quite different from each other. These two personalities were actually pretty different from each other and it was amusing to see a person such as Sena have these differing personalities.  
 
YunYun  
YunYun voiced by veteran seiyuu Aki Toyosaki of Ange Vierge and Knights of Sidonia fame is a support character that was introduced in this season. A powerful mage like Megumin YunYun is a capable combatant that does not have the limitations of Megumin and is capable of using a larger variety of spells. YunYun is a former classmate of Megumin’s and is the daughter of the crimson demons unlike Megumin who is a descendant of them. Unlike Megumin who has a rather peculiar personality which has the effect of making her stand out YunYun is the opposite in that she has what can be described as a rather normal if plain personality. This personality unfortunately caused her to be ignored and neglected by her classmates which caused her to have a relatively Hard school year where she had not one friend. This itself I felt was pretty sad. One of YunYun’s most notable traits is her self-described rivalry with Megumin in which she sees Megumin as her eternal rival and constantly tries to challenge her to often hilarious results. One scene that stood out the most with regards to Megumin and YunYun was their interaction with the friendship crystal at wiz’s shop. I felt that Aki Toyosaki did a pretty good job of portraying YunYun and I kinda wished that she was part of the party’s line-up as her spells would have proved pretty useful.   
 
Vanir  
Vanir voiced by voice actor Nishida Masakazu of Gunslinger strato’s fame is a support character that served as the main villain for the second arc and later a recurring character. A member of the Devils king army and a high ranking one at that has a rather special ability in that he can read everything there is about someone. This means when facing normal adventurers, he will have the advantage as he will know what his opponents is thinking and how they would react to certain situations which I think is an interesting advantage. However, this power while powerful has its limits as he can’t use it against someone that’s either more powerful than him, and those that are weaker than him. So basically, this power can only be used on those that are equal in power to him. Vanir however is no pushover in combat though but an interesting thing about him is that while he is powerful he refuses to use his most powerful skills on humans which means that he has some sense of honor in him despite being an enemy. The manner of Vanir’s defeat itself was quite funny and I was glad that it ended the way it did. Despite being a powerful enemy Vanir was also rather comical in the manner that he spoke. 
  
Wiz  
Wiz played by veteran seiyuu Yui Horie is a character that was introduced back in the first season as a guest character that eventually was given a more permanent role. A former member of the Devil Kings army unlike the others Wiz respects life and people and as a result voluntarily left it becoming neutral to them under specific terms. Like in the first season she continues to run a magic tools shop in town that the cast frequents. Wiz is given much more of an expanded role in this season not acting as just comic relief but also a good source of advice for the cast in the final story arc. Despite leaving the army Wiz is still a capable combatant as evidenced by her display in the last arc battles. The last arc also expanded a little about Wiz’s morals specifically her unwillingness to kill innocents as well as her unwillingness to fight. I felt that Wiz’s character was expanded a great deal making her a far more interesting character rather than being mere comic relief. The last act also revealed that Wiz actually has another side to her usual bubbly and clueless personality that is unleashed when she gets really angry and that was quite a surprise to see. 
 
Her hardworking personality and the fact that she gets nervous easily was nice to see as was her interactions with Aqua. I thought that the series did well to make her part of Kazuma’s group even a temporary member as she brings plenty of positive things to the group in addition to comic relief. Overall, I felt that Yui Horie did a great job in portraying Wiz and I hope that she continues to be present if this gets another season.  
 
Arts and Animation  
Character designs for the show I felt were as good as ever and I felt that the environments that the cast go through in this season was beautifully designed and rendered. In terms of animation I felt that it was done pretty well. The combat scenes that were present in the season I felt were beautifully designed and rendered and animated with the battle against Vanir and the battle against the final boss being my favorites.  
Music  
The music for this series I felt was pretty good particularly the opening theme which was sung by veteran singer Machico and the ending theme which was sung by the seiyuu’s that voiced Aqua, Darkness and Megumin who are Sora Amamiya, Ai Kayano and Rie Takahashi respectively. The scene music also felt appropriate for the respective scenes as well. 
 
Overall conclusion 
 
Konosuba’s 2nd season is still as impressive as the first in that it still manages to create an impressive and fun setting while balancing the need to be both serious and at the same time comical. I felt that the overall story was done reasonably well with each of the story arcs having some memorable villains within them. in true Konosuba fashion none of these villains are not actually overly evil but are simply evil. While the focus for the 1st season was focused more on gathering the party members and get them to work as a group this season took the focus on forging bonds with them and let us as viewers see a little of the backstories. Seeing Darkness’s reason for becoming a crusader and seeing what her family was like was interesting. The voice acting for the series I felt was pretty well done with particular praise going to Sora Amamiya, Rie Takahashi and Ai Kayano who voiced the three main heroines. Aki Toyosaki and Yui Horie who voiced YunYun and Wiz I felt also did well. In terms, of character development it was nice to see Kazuma taking more of a leadership role in the party as well as develop some actual skills that will be useful to him whether alone or with his party.  In conclusion i really enjoyed the second season of Konosuba as its the type of show that is smart enough to be serious one minute and be comedic the next without sacrificing either. In fact I actually use Konosuba as a means to relax after a days work and having a good laugh is one thing that it never fails to do. This is one anime that i hope will get renewed for another season.

    Fullmetal Alchemist is a famous manga and Bones adapted it successfully. Here is my opinion about this Anime: 
--Story: Its story is great. Some people will see that FA's story is similar to most of shounen anime but it's not all. Its story is added some tragedy details. Elric and his brother can't always save everyone. It makes them haunting. 
--Art: Thanks to Nakamura, fight scenes are very well. And its art also doesn't have anything to say. 
--Sound: I like some OP and sound is always good. 
--Character: There are plenty of kind of character in Fullmetal Alchemist. This makes anime become more and more attractive. 
--Overall: Good anime to watch

    When I first heard of this anime i was interested to start watching it , it was written by the same team behind Angel Beats ! one of my favorite series as well as being an original title. When i finished the anime all it did was leave a sour taste in my mouth.  
 
Story :  
The first 8 episodes were actually decent and enjoyable for me , there was actually build up  and character development throughout those 8 epsiodes with tons of interesting character interactions among the characters. Not only that , there was actually a sense of progression which was sorely lacking in the second half. However i really felt like the encounters with the other ability users could have been cut shorter instead of dedicating an entire episode to it but that might just be me.  
 
Now for the episodes after 8 or what i would like to call the 2nd half , the 2nd is actually a lot darker which was a change i personally really liked , but was it executed properly ? Hell no, everything was off in the 2nd half. The pacing was incredibly poorly done , everything was going so fast that it left you overwhelmed with question it never truly answers. It also undoes everything the first 8 episodes were building up for and then proceeds to throw all the character development down the drain. This was personally something i couldn't look past , why make something major that changed all the characters then proceed to take all the impact that it had away by undoing it ?  
 
Next is the ending , Oh. My. God. How could someone actually write an ending like this  and release it is beyond me. I have no idea how to describe it to you since this is an entity on its own. Go watch it and you will know what i mean.  
 
Characters :  
My main problem with this anime actually lies on its characters and while i enjoyed the main characters and their interactions with others i have to say that aside from 2 characters which was Nao and Otosaka none of the others were given enough development to make me actually feel attached to them at all and this is due to the massive influx of characters that the show keeps on pouring in as the episodes progressed. An example would be Ayumi , being a major character that played a part in progressing the story , she was given so little screen time and development that i really didn't care or felt attached at all to her character. She was the typical little sister character that was there for the sake of being there , same goes to the majority of characters in the anime , they are given so little development and was just there for the story to move forward which is disappointing coming from the people who made Angel Beats. 
 
Art : 
One of the saving points of this anime is actually its art and animation , the characters were designed pretty well and backgrounds were beautifully made. There were some scenes where i just paused and observed how beautifully drawn the background , some fighting scenes were insanely well animated as well so kudos to the people behind the art and animation you guys deserve a cookie. 
 
Sound:  
The voice actors actually did a really decent job in voicing the characters , all of them sounded like i expected them to sound which was a huge plus for me. The OST and songs that were used for the OP and ED were also pretty amazing and this is definitely one of the merits of this show 
 
Overall :  
 
While i enjoyed some parts of this show I couldn't look past the faults to give it a score higher then 5/10. I left the show with a ton of questions and was given an ending that left me unsatisfied , perhaps it could have done a better job with 24 episodes but at its current state a 5/10 is all i could give it.

    A girl and her extraordinary bond with wild beasts. An ancient secret hidden away by a mysterious clan that comes and goes with the mists. A growing conflict between the two great ruling regions of the land.  
 
Together, these narrative threads form the intricate web that is Kemono no Souja Erin, a coming-of-age story that slowly unfolds against the backdrop of political tension. Through the course of 50 episodes, these story lines gradually intertwine and eventually come together to deliver a somewhat clumsy but mostly satisfying conclusion. 
 
Kemono no Souja Erin is undoubtedly a slow-paced anime. It takes its time to set everything up, and some viewers may find this unappealing. But for those who love to absorb themselves in fantasy settings, this show will not disappoint. The amount of detail that is meticulously crafted into the history and culture of the land is captivating. And because the relationship between man and animal is such a core element of the show, even the behavior of the beast-lords and their interactions with the main character Erin is explored quite extensively.  
 
Because Kemono no Souja Erin retains its leisurely rhythm throughout, this gives the show enough time to build upon its greatest strength: Erin herself. 
 
I can honestly say that Erin is one of the most well-developed characters I've seen in a storytelling medium, anime or otherwise. We smile with her and cry with her as she grows from a child — curious and endearing — to a young adult burdened with years of experience. From the get-go, we see that Erin is a bright and studious young girl, taking the opportunity to learn all that she can from her mentors. Each stage of her life is detailed in a humble and straightforward fashion. Her actions, decisions, and even morals are a direct result of the hardships that she has endured during the course of the story. Even as she grows and develops, one key characteristic of Erin remains consistent: her resolve. To be blunt, Erin is obstinate, almost to the point of stubbornness. She chooses to remain steadfast in her beliefs, even though she is quite aware of the consequences of the path she is leading. Don't be fooled by the negative connotation of these words though; they are exactly why Erin is such a human character. 
 
The other characters in the series are rather hit or miss. Some of them turn out to be bland and stereotypical, such as the main antagonist; others are not really explored fully, such as the Mist People. Furthermore, the comic relief duo of Nukku and Mokku may be appealing to children but will likely be irritating to more mature viewers. Several characters, however, play key roles in Erin's development and are interesting individuals in their own right, such as Ia-lu. But perhaps the most important characters in the show besides Erin are the beast-lords with which Erin bonds. Their attachment to Erin is very believable; it is touching and tragic at times, but never idealistic. Beast-lords are wild creatures after all, and they rightfully remain as such during the course of the series.  
 
My main gripes with the show may sound picky, but unfortunately they were severe enough to affect my enjoyment of the show. Recycled scenes and flashbacks are prevalent in the show; one scene in particular is replayed so often that it becomes grating, even though the purpose of repeating it is understandable — for reinforcement. Still, I believe that the show would have benefited from cutting down on the excessive use of such scenes. I also noticed that the same few insert songs were used in almost every episode, and many of them are inappropriately placed. The emotional impact of these songs would be greater if they had been used properly and more sparingly. And as mentioned earlier, the ending (particularly the very last episode) was messy and could have used more closure, especially since it was a 50-episode series. 
 
I feel like these flaws were the unfortunate result of the show trying to be family-friendly — an interesting dilemma indeed, considering that most of the story is presented with a level of sophistication that no child could hope to appreciate. 
 
The art in Kemono no Souja Erin is simple, unique, and has a very appropriate children's-book feel to it. The OST is pretty varied and ranges from soft piano tracks and ambient pieces to Oriental-sounding melodies and even electric guitar tracks. They add a nice touch to the show's atmosphere for the most part. The OP and ED in particular are of great significance; they are heartwarming at first, but both are replaced about halfway through to fit the change in tone of the series. 
 
If you can manage to ignore its flaws, Kemono no Souja Erin will shine for you — if you give it the time to do so, that is. For those of you who desire continuous plot development, a fast-paced narrative, or loud action scenes, this anime is not for you. It is an anime for those of you who simply desire a warm and well-told fantasy tale with a solid main character and a truly fascinating world.

    This anime is one that I can watch over and over again and not ever get bored. I watch it on Netflix all the time.  
 
But lets talk about why shall we?  
 
The story: 9/10 
The story follows Haruhi Fujioka, a first year at Ouran Academy. After making it there on a full scholarship, Haruhi's goals are to be a lawyer much like their late mother. However, while looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the Ouran Host Club, and also stumbles upon a very expensive vase, shattering it into pieces and is thrown into an 8 million yen debt. Now, Haruhi must woo over one thousand girls to pay back the debt. However, Haruhi is actually a girl herself! This quirky school comedy follows the struggles of each member of the infamous Ouran Host Club.  
 
The story is pretty solid. It's unique, and fun. It kind of set the bar for school stories. That's probably why I enjoy it so much.  
 
Art and Sound: Both 9/10.  
The art is unique and a lot of fun. The artists really had a blast drawing each scene and you could tell. Funimation and the Japanese seiyuus also give these characters distinct voices and personalities. I'm a dub fan in anime, but the sub is undeniably good as well.  
 
Characters: 10/10 
These characters are so good. Being a reverse harem, you would figure Haruhi's character is just there as a place holder for the viewer to place themselves in, giving them the ability to be with any character of their choosing. This usually means the female lead is bland or boring. Haruhi however is not. She's independent, to the point where she has very limited social skills, she's smart, she's beautiful, and she sticks up for her friends and those she believes in.  
 
The male cast around her is good as well. They are not just some pretty faces. The anime does a good job diving into each characters past and psyches. You see each one grow with the help of Haruhi's non-bias and motherly guidance. Not only that, but they boys help out Haruhi. They teach her how to be social again, and how to depend on others.  
 
The side characters are good too. They all have episodes dedicated to their stories and you feel for each one, wanting them to succeed.  
 
It truly is a great cast of characters.  
 
This anime is beautiful. It's funny, it's sad, it's heartwarming. Sure, the last two episodes stray from the manga, but that only encourages people to go READ the manga.  
 
Everyone should watch this. It's a great gateway into anime, and it's just a lot of fun.

    Honestly, it's not for everyone. 
I myself have a few complaints in the way of how bland Zen is for a majority of the first season and the sheer amount of time Shirayuki falls down (literally, I mean). I don't really think it's super unique, either.  
Here are the things Akagami no Shirayuki-hime does right, in my opinion. 1) It doesn't lead you on. You see the relationship, you know it's going somewhere, and it does. 2) Shirayuki actually works to stay by Zen's side. It's easy to have a story line where seemingly unimportant girl meets prince, falls in love, realizes the social gap, and then some unforeseen circumstance turns her into someone who can stay by his side. Shirayuki doesn't have that. 3) Not all bad guys stay bad guys, not all good guys act like good guys, and not all girls are evil. This general hallmark of shojo romance is annoying and I'm glad it could be subverted here. 4) Zen doesn't absolutely detest his position. It happens so often, you have a prince who doesn't want to be a prince and, without any consideration for his actions, runs away. Sure, Zen acts more freely and has some conflict about being a prince, but its justified in story and he still takes his status into consideration even when Shirayuki is involved. 
Not saying it's perfect, or original, or that everyone should like it, but I think it's pretty good.

    Gankutsuou is a work of art. Everything, from the characters, to the story, the setting, the rendition, is like a master artist's dream work. If you can appreciate the human characteristics of honor, justice,loyalty and on the other side: avarice, lust for fame and power, then you have come to the right anime show. Gankutsuou depicts the best and worst of human natures. This is a story of love, loyalty, betrayal and vengeance.  If you're a romantic by nature, you'll love this creation. The creators of this anime put a lot of thought into making Gankutsuou as romantic as possible, in the mould of late medieval Europe. 
 
The setting is quite unconventional, with a mixture of the old and new. Its as if pre-revolutionary France has met the future world of starships and interstellar empires. This shock cultural and technological mix is in fact quite well portrayed and hence is quite appealing. This dystopia is enriched by the presence of the lead of the show, the Count of Monte Cristo aka Gankutsuou who's on a personal quest of vengeance against the perpetrators of heinous crimes committed against him in the past. His highly eccentric but charming nature concealed a coiled beast underneath, the beating heart of the creature that is Gankutsuou, who gives credence to the ideals of retribution for injustices. 
 
The characters are thoroughly explored and are very well thought of. The culture is pre-revolutionary and hence chivalry, honor and etiquette are some key. The protagonist's character is moulded by these attributes and so are most of his companion characters. Settling disputes and arguments through duels are the norm. However these 'duels' are fought in giant exoskeletons, which in essence are giant robots controlled by the person inside. Some of these duelling behemoths are shown in the anime and adds a different dimension to the mixture of cultural and technological settings. 
 
The animation is a masterpiece. It truly is quite spectacular to behold. The textures are somehow always 'flowing', adjusting themselves to the surroundings, like a chameleon. Words dson't do it justice but its quite pleasing to watch. The 3-D effects add finesse. 
 
The story is quite similar to the that of the book titled 'The Count of Monte Cristo' by Alexander Dumas, with some added touches by the developers. The story as a whole is well worthy of five stars out of five. Romantics would love this work. 
 
The soundtrack is apt for the 18th century setting France living hundreds of years into the future. The soundtrack does justice to the critical points of the story and setting, causing thrill and intrigue among the viewers. 
 
Overall, this is a must watch anime. Its quite underrated in my opinion and should be ranked much higher than 216. This anime most definitely promises entertainment.

    I loved this anime and I don't understand why people are rating it low or giving it bad reviews. The character animation and art is simply one of the best i've ever seen. It has a decent story too though i'll admit it seems a bit rushed near the end. It's the best super power anime i've ever watched and I believe it's terribly under-rated. The character development is great and the action fits the story perfectly unlike soe anime which have needless action and fighting. It fits   
a lot of genres and creates a well balanced overall story. The characters are lovable and you'll get immediately attached to them. If you lijed this one then be sure to check out Angel Beats.

    For me Black Lagoon and Cowboy Bebop are two of my favorite series. The mixture of interesting and human characters, excellent (if over the top) fighting, and underlying and hidden discussions and opinions about life, people, etc. When I first started watching Black Lagoon I fell completely in love with the characters, the differing points of view conflicting, the psychosis, the struggles to understand each other and dealing with a wide variety of backgrounds and histories. And to top it all of was that they felt real and believable. Characters didn't just do things because the story needed them to, but because its what they would do based on their particular ethos. 
 
The OVA felt like none of that. Well a lot less of that. Minor character spoilers ahead nothing particularly story related. 
  
My biggest issue was that Rock suddenly seemed to jump off the deep end. In the beginning of the OVA he is still the same person from the series, trying to stand amongst the gangsters and murderers of Roanapur and trying to be a player in things, while still trying to hold on to his morals and ideals from his life as a salary man. Then he just suddenly switches to a mastermind role who has everything in his pocket and in several shots in the OVA is portrayed almost as a villain. Nothing wrong with the concept of an evil protagonist, Black Lagoon is full of them, but the change in Rock is so complete and he shows none of his usual motivations, is he doing this because of what happened in Tokyo in the last season? Is this to try and spite Chang? Or has he just suddenly snapped and dropped his previous ideals? They bring up what happened in Tokyo for a bit at the start and then it's never mentioned or alluded to during Rock's scheming. While the reasoning they provided at the end feels sort of hollow and pointless. 
 
Apart from that Balalaika lost a lot of her bite and felt like a girl raging at the wind, none of her usual ""I'll do what you want but I'm going to make sure it costs you"". Chang went from being a sort of suave gunman, who had a sense of humor hiding the power and darkness he posses, to a character who just sort of sat in a penthouse smoking and looking pensively at things. Even Revy seemed to be like she was trying to redeem herself and let her ideals be easily run over. It felt like a different Revy than the one in the submarine or in Tokyo. 
 
The main character was also a bit ambiguous. Following Rock at first, viewing the scenario from his point of view, to sort of abandoning him and following Garcia and Fabiola viewing Rock as evil or at least malicious. 
 
This isn't to say that it's a bad series, the gun play is still excellent (and over the top), some of the dialogue and scenes are great. It also provides some good back story (although it didn't really do anything with it as a lot of it is revealed towards the end of the arc and it doesn't feel like the revelations have any impact on the story). 
 
This feels like Black Lagoon light (ironic considering the added violence and sexuality, a good visceral addition that I would love to see more of in the series) the characters just weren't there. 
 
tl;dr 
Having the story drive the characters rather than the characters driving the story makes for an exciting series, but one that lacks the usual depth and intrigue of the regular series.

    There's many a time where careless things that we say or do to confidants that we don't really mean, or haven't gotten around to thinking through, or is colored by a veil of naivety that come to haunt us later in life. We give in or we seek to rectify... Misaka's certainly in the latter. But in this case, is it even possible for her? When a desire for normalcy clashes with reality, a contradiction results, and a story is born. 
 
A Certain Scientific Railgun S is the sequel to the first installment of an anime adaptation of a Japanese comic of manga artist, Motoi Fuyukama's, and light novelist Kazuma Kamachi. Original character designer is Kiyotaka Haimura, and the anime equivalent is Yuichi Tanaka. Returning major staff is Director Tatsuyuki Nagai, script writers Hiroyuki Yoshino, Michihiro Tsuchiya, Yasunori Yamada, Kurasumi Sunayama, Daisuke Takashima, Jukki Handa, and Seishi Minakami. A side story to another of Kamachi's works, A Certain Magical Index, we follow the adventures of Mikoto Misaka, otherwise known as Railgun, one of only few Level 5 espers and one of the most powerful individuals in Academy, and her band of friends, though rather than featuring said friends, this season focuses on Misaka. Index cast members make recurring and new appearances, Kamijo Touma, Index's main protagonist, considering the first arc, Sisters, was originally conceived as Index content, and Accelerator. The Railgun manga, in addition to the many episodes dedicated to her initial discovery of the Sisters and the shit that happens thereafter, frames the events of Sisters from a mainly Misaka perspective. Small, but significant cinematic and psychological retcons occur out of the original Indexverse that, together, change the context of this for the better, dramatically. Railgun S, an effort by the staff, no doubt, to be holistic for the sake of Railgun-only viewers, reuses scenes of Kamijo's perspective from the parent tale (minus the tedious fan service bits) to explain his important, but otherwise random role in the plot's and Misaka's development. The art and animation, already alright in the first season, received a remarkable update come this season, courtesy of this predecessor's financial success. The backdrops are that much more enchanting, tension-biting, or depressing as the progression of the show sees fit, the designs look that much more refined, the action is that much more stunning. But the winner goes to the facial expressions, which makes those comical and curious moments as endearing to enjoy as it makes those damaged and desperate instances sickening to watch. And then there's happiness and hope despite, even if those expressions are emotionless. 
 
Now, Academy City can be thought of as a board game. The previous season of Railgun was meant to set the pieces, and as any normal participant in a board game demands for their time, a system must be put in place to keep the game fair and balanced. Otherwise, for the normal participant, which comprise the vast majority of denizens in this technological metropolis, it wouldn't be much fun. Rules for the general public must be followed. Images for the general public must be believed. So long as the many people accept that, then everything might as well be well, never mind the seedy fissures strung against those few individuals that aren't as adept at playing, because every city has its issues. Come this season of Railgun, it's apparent it's all one big lie, where those on high make and break what they will. For fame. For fortune. For science! Anything resembling human dignity and decency to anything resembling humanity, be damned... as per the calculations of an impersonal machine. The machine makes the policy, and the impersonal humans obey. All of this starts with the Sisters Arc. All of this leads to one particular participant by the name of Misaka and her whole world forcibly turned over. Not even her prowess as an electromaster is enough to defy it, defy them... ultimately, defy Academy City itself, the darkness and the light, and everyone, impersonal or no, that comprise it. And here, where the spotlight is towards no one but her, I reiterate of her identity from my previous review and add a few more things: “independent, proud, sometimes to the point of headstrong and hot-tempered, child-like in her tastes, yet fussily contrarian when she's called on it, and fiercely loyal. She has a heart of gold and lightening, but foremost, she's a girl who wants nothing more than a relatively normal life (as normal as it can get for someone with esper powers) with the people she treasures.” It is here in this arc, in this time that tries any person's sanity, that plays chicken with love and leal, that her character isn't just flesh-deep. It is soul-driven... in a non-spiritual, scientifically acceptable sense.   
 
And then the show ends with the comparative mess that is the Silent Party Arc, plot-based anime original content after Sisters, in keeping with the staff's habit to wrap up loose ends from the source. A comparative mess to the rest of Railgun, and just a mess in general. Railgun's anime original content, especially its plot-based material, from installation one was always inferior to a degree, but this arc's writing, never mind the possible time constraints or the lack of ideas, is just plain bad, especially in the wake of Sisters. Our heroine makes some uncharacteristically stupid decisions, characters are introduced lazily and clumsily, and friendship is forcibly and repeatedly beaten into the main audience like dead ponies. The conflict that initiates this arc to begin with isn't even that uninteresting a premise, building on Academy City's inherent encouragement of discrimination: espers vs. unappreciated non-esper geniuses. But we're not given any emotional cue to care about it from the antagonists of this arc because they are so tediously uninspired, so predictably generic, so underwhelmingly, and, thus, irritatingly cocky. These faults aren't fixed by the fact that slow-paced content that I'd usually count on for characterization instead comprises mostly of flashbacks and fan service. And yes, the excessive mini moe moments courtesy of Febri counts as fan service too.  
 
Continuing the Index and Railgun (henceforth known as Raildex) tradition of OP theme and consistency, OP1, “sisters noise” and OP3, “eternal reality,” were done by fripSide, both, more or less, the techno rumping, adrenaline-pumping, and bass thumping thrillers their season one predecessors were, OP1, in particular, having a nice voice over chant to accentuate the music's climax. Fast, smooth, and dynamic transitions for each character, just like previous OPs, are also of observed custom. ED1 is “Grow Slowly” by Iguchi Yuka, electric guitar, strings, vocals and keyboard making for a conventional send-off the first 3/4s of the song, the last 1/4, when nothing but the vocals and keyboard remain, adding an extra bittersweet note when paired with the visuals and the context after a certain point in the show. She also does a special ED2 insert in Episodes 11 and 14, the slower, but no less great to listen to “standstill.” It's especially evocative when synergized with the events of the show (those regarding Kamijo's contributions, the focus of the visuals which shows Misaka and Kamijo back to back, flipped depending on, once again, the context). ED3 is “Links” by Sachika Misawa which, with the clover and gekota, once again emphasize this show's inescapable obsession with friendship. She also does Episode 23 ED4 special insert “Infinia.” 
 
The Silent Party Arc certainly left a lot to be desired, like the desire to end the show early. But my passion for Railgun has only be bent, not broken. The Sisters Arc, though, is one of the best things I've seen out of the Raildex franchise, Misaka firmly entrenched as a favorite character as a result.  
 
I give A Certain Scientific Railgun S an 8 out of 10.

    - English Review (Translated version) 
 
I had quite a few hopes for ""Kamisama Kiss"". Seriously. I was attracted to the atmosphere and the thematic: traditional Japanese folklore, a pinch of real world mixed with legends, divinities, spirits... Doesn't sound bad at all, right? Saving the distances, its bases reminded me of ""Noragami"", an anime that I have enjoyed quite a lot (without being a masterpiece). 
 
Okay, where's the problem then? Maybe I should intone the ""mea culpa"" in this case. Maybe I should have informed myself a little beyond the environment of ""Kamisama Kiss"" to understand that it's basically a romance story, a shojo. A pure and hard shojo, I might add. Excessively shojo, probably. 
 
I am not against the inclusion of love in anime (or in any audiovisual piece). On the contrary, I think it is something natural and basic in life and as such should be shown. I insist... Where is the fault then? On which ""Kamisama Kiss"" bases its plot so much on the romance between the protagonists, and it forgets everything else and ends up clogging up. A lot. As if you eat tons of chocolate every day and finally you hate it for having insisted so much. 
 
""Kamisama Kiss"" has a lot of totally wasted elements, which is very sad thing. As I said, it has a japanese folklore based atmosphere, full of supernatural creatures. Yes, a ambience that is not taken advantage of at any time. Let's be serious, if this packaging were removed, the whole plot could be exactly the same with a couple of arrangements. This is very frustrating, because this japanese background of legend is really taken care of and well accomplished (the music is great, for example), but everything is for nothing. 
 
And we come to the characters. There are two main characters, Nanami and Tomoe. Nanami is the typical girl inclined to fall in love, clumsy, but with a good heart. Tomoe is the typical attractive, with a stormy past, but he hides kindness inside. Well... they are not the most original thing in the world, but at least the secondary ones will be more varied. Secon... what? ""Kamisama Kiss"" starts and ends in both of them. There are a short group of minor characters that appear from time to time, whose transcendence is really null and they are there because of the demands of the script. Stop counting. As I said, the lack of use of resources is maximum and in the section of characters is no different. 
 
Not everything is bad. The technical section is a great result and the music have a quite high level. And I suppose that whoever likes pure and hard romances, without any kind of variety or nuances, will enjoy this anime, but this is not my case. I won't stop complaining about what might have been, but it wasn't. A pity. 
 
 
- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version) 
 
Tenía bastantes esperanzas puestas en ""Kamisama Kiss"". En serio. Me atraía la ambientación y la temática: folklore tradicional japonés, una pizca de mundo real mezclado con leyendas, divinidades, espíritus... ¿No suena nada mal, no? Salvando las distancias sus bases me recordaban a ""Noragami"", un anime que he disfrutado bastante (sin ser ninguna obra maestra). 
 
Vale, ¿dónde está el problema entonces? Quizá deba entonar el ""mea culpa"" en este caso. Quizá debería haberme informado un poco más allá de la ambientación de ""Kamisama Kiss"" para darme cuenta que básicamente es una historia sobre romance, un shojo. Un shojo puro y duro, debería añadir. Excesivamente shojo probablemente. 
 
No estoy en contra de la inclusión de amor en el anime (ni en ninguna obra audiovisual). Al contrario, creo que es algo natural y básico en la vida y como tal debe mostrarse. Insisto... ¿dónde está el fallo pues? En que ""Kamisama Kiss"" basa tanto su trama en el romance entre los protagonistas que olvida todo lo demás y termina por empalagar. Mucho. Como si comieras kilos de chocolate cada día y finalmente lo aborrecieras por haber insistido tanto con ello. 
 
""Kamisama Kiss"" tiene un montón de elementos totalmente desaprovechados, lo cual es una pena. Como comentaba, tiene una ambientación basada en el folklore japonés, repleta de criaturas sobrenaturales. Sí, una ambientación a la que no se le saca partido en ningún momento. Seamos serios, si quitaran este envoltorio toda la trama podría ser exactamente igual con un par de arreglos. Esto es muy triste, porque este marco nipón de leyenda está verdaderamente cuidado y conseguido (la música es genial, por ejemplo), pero todo es para nada. 
 
Y llegamos a los personajes. Están los dos protagonistas, Nanami y Tomoe. Nanami es la típica chica enamoradiza, patosa, pero de buen corazón. Tomoe es el típico guapete, con un pasado tormentoso, pero que esconde bondad en su interior. Bueno... no son lo más original del mundo, pero al menos los secundarios serán más variados. ¿Secu... qué? ""Kamisama Kiss"" acaba y empieza en ellos dos. Hay un puñado de personajes que aparecen de vez en cuando, cuya trascendencia en realidad es nula y están ahí por exigencias del guion. Para de contar. Como ya he dicho, la falta de aprovechamiento de recursos es máxima y en el apartado de personajes no es diferente. 
 
No todo es malo. El apartado técnico es resultón y la música tiene un nivel bastante alto. Y supongo que a quien le gusten los romances puros y duros, sin ningún tipo de variedad ni matiz, disfrutará de este anime, pero no es mi caso. Yo no dejaré de lamentarme de lo que podría haber sido, pero no fue. Una pena.

    Rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai, this anime is a terrific masterpiece that is full of emotions and actions stick into a brilliant storyline. This anime is presented in a very UNIQUE way that is much different from the other school romance animes. The most amazing part of this anime is the supernatural world that they are living in and how the surrounding problems are solved through love, perseverance, optimistic, patience, courage and so on.  
 
For people who just started watching this anime, I have to agree with you guys that it might be a bit baffling to understand what’s going on. However, it’s okay, you will definitely understand the whole story until the end if you went through it fastidiously without skippings. Many people might think that why this anime is named in such uncanny way “Rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai”???? I believe it’s most probably just a clickbait because there is nothing really to do with it. However, don’t ever get twisted by this fact, the story will still set you dumbfounded.  
 
Overall it was a marvelous masterpiece that should be watched by everyone. This anime shows the future of the new anime development like srsly dudes. You all must watch it or else you all gonna be regret AF for missing such brilliant masterpiece.  
 
Lastly, It is for the people who have finished watching this anime. I’m looking forward to s2 and I’m pretty sure there’s gonna be a s2 or maybe an OVA about Shoko’s case which still remains a mystery. I CAN”T WAIT ACTUALLY, ANY IDEA WHEN IS IT COMING OUT??

    TL;DR: Watch this movie for the love, loss, and war you can expect in Japanese war movies. If you've seen any, like for example Barefoot Gen, you should know kinda what to expect walking in. 
 
Right after the overall score is the ""should you watch it"" chart. 
 
There is also a spoiler section at the very bottom for detailed commentary. Most people would not consider these spoilers, but they may hint at plot developments indirectly. Whether or not you wish to view them is up to you. 
 
 
Story: 8/10 
 
This movie takes place mainly around World War II, and talks about a ditzy and dreamy little girl called Suzu from Hiroshima. She loves drawing, but is a bit clumsy at a lot of other things. In 1944, when she was 18, she was forced into a marriage with Shuusaku, a man she had never met from the city of Kure. With WWII raging on, how will Suzu and Shuusaku's life change? How will the people they meet change?  
 
You probably already know what will happen, the question is just how it will get there. The themes are the same as most war movies, with perhaps just a tiny sprinkle of romance and beauty mixed in it. The movie's story does not really veer into the realm of the unexpected, yet the presentation of it is captivating. 
 
A criticism of this movie that I have is that it moves extremely slow early on, and the pace is just all over the place. Sometimes years are just skipped, whereas sometimes you have events happening one after another on the same day. Though I get that it's kinda the point, it's unfortunately not something I prefer. 
 
One thing I like is that the movie takes advantage of Suzu's dreaminess in order to give some fantastic surreal animation. Sometimes, you have no idea if something actually happened, or was simply the product of her imagination. The art contributes to this, which leads me to the next section. 
 
 
Art: 10/10 
 
It's a shame that I cannot give 11 for art to this movie. It is dynamic, abstract, and dreamy. It looks a bit like it was drawn with watercolor. As I was watching the animation of this movie, I couldn't help but feel that this was exactly how Suzu saw the world with her eyes. There are many climactic moments and significant events that are portrayed to convey feeling rather than realism. The art floats above the clouds and is not shackled by the restrictions of reality.  
 
 
Sound: 9.5 (rounded up to 10)/10 
 
It's hard to do sound wrong nowadays. I don't have much of a requirement for sound, as long as the music makes me feel what I think it's trying to make me feel at any given point. I usually don't have much to say about voice acting either, but in this case I found Suzu's voice acting in the very beginning of the movie slightly strange, as her voice didn't quite match the age of the character at the time. Once the movie progressed over to 1944, it became a lot more fitting. 
 
 
Character: 8.5 (rounded up to 9)/10 
 
Character development for Suzu and Shuusaku was very substantial. The movie does a great job at showing their development without explicitly telling you. However, there were characters that got the short end of the stick, per se. Look in the spoiler section for commentary there. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
 
I have a somewhat personal grudge against this movie. As a person that loves watching romance, arranged marriages just do not sit with me very well. It took out a lot of enjoyment from the movie for me. The movie was also a bit too predictable, and did not try anything new with its approach. Perhaps I have seen too many of these movies; I found it hard to immerse myself into it, and frequently found myself pulled into reality saying 'oh that reminds me of such and such war movie'. Overall though, it was rather enjoyable regardless of all of these things. I also have some spoilers regarding enjoyment at the end pertaining to the romance aspect of the film. 
 
 
Overall: 8/10 
 
As in my other reviews, my overall score is based only on enjoyment, and my enjoyment takes into account pretty much everything about the movie and summarizes it into a single number. Despite not having any emotional impact on me whatsoever, I was still glad I got to experience it. Although I personally did not enjoy it as much as I liked, I believe that there are many people, especially those that are fans of war movies or emotional stories that will love this movie and hail it as a masterpiece. 
 
 
The ""should you watch it"" chart: 
 
Do you: 
- like Japanese history? 
- enjoy Japanese WWII movies? animated movies? 
- like themes such as learning to live with people, coping with what fate gives you, and other themes of war movies? 
- enjoy slow paced movies that are grounded in the realities of life? 
- enjoy subtle, emotional stories? 
 
Then you will likely watch this show. If you do not like all of these things, you may or may not like the movie. Your mileage may vary. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Very light spoilers ahead. You have been warned. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Spoilers: 
 
My personal enjoyment of this movie was impacted not only just because of the arranged marriage, but because the arranged marriage broke a pairing that I just kinda expected would happen based on the events of the movie. When true love gets torn by circumstances like that, I like it only when I expect it to happen. That was probably one of the few unpredictable things about the movie, but unfortunately that took away a lot of my enjoyment rather than add to it. 
 
One other thing that was rather annoying was that it introduced characters, then did basically nothing with them ever again. This would've been fine for me if it had just been left alone, but the characters reappear, making them more than just insignificant characters. Just when they have shed the identity of insignificant character, they disappear from the rest of the story. I doubt this is by accident, and was probably intended as a sort of realistic portrayal of how sometimes we just never find out about what happened to some people or meet them again. This didn't do anything to alleviate my frustration, however.

    When I first embarked on the journey of One Piece I honestly did not know what to expect. After catching up with Naruto and found myself perusing different anime trying to find something similar to Naruto. After watching a few rather short series, I was intrigued by One Piece but quickly became dissuaded as the episode count was around 400+ at this point. Well I decided to wait till I had free time to watch it. Fast forward a couple of months. It's the summer break, I'm bored at home one day and decide to give One Piece a go. I'll admit that while the first couple of episodes were enjoyable, I could tell that I was not truly hooked on the series. The art style was rather strange, a lot of characters had disproportionately large feet compared to their bodies. The animation in the beginning is also not that great as this is an old series(however both the art style and animation improve over time). The episode that threw all doubt about this series was the Baratie Arc. In the early East Blue saga, Baratie is my favorite arc for a numerous amount of reasons. The themes touched upon during that arc spoke of the power of will, ambition, and dreams. This is was the moment I knew I was in it for the long haul. 
 One Piece is still continuing with the end still quite a distance away. This anime while containing basic shounen elements, such as a not too bright protagonist with a goal and having friendship be a key aspect, is able to contain a lovable quirky main cast, most of which are not one dimensional characters, a vast and unique world which is brimming with adventure, and a milieu of interesting characters and plots contained within it. My favorite aspect of One Piece is the adventure and exploration, the mangaka Eiichiro Oda was definitely successful in creating an interesting and vibrant world, and the anime for the most part conveys it well. 
The animation quality is the biggest complaint I have with this anime. For a majority of the series the animation quality is actually pretty good,it started off poor but steadily improved. After the Skypiea arc the improvement is significant. The quality lasts like this until the Marineford Arc, after which it devolves. Currently, due to almost catching up with the manga in terms of content, coupled with the poor animation quality by Toei has made the One Piece anime drop in quality, which is a shame because One Piece has a sacred spot in my top 5 manga.

    When you're bored and have absolutely nothing to do, this anime is definitely worth checking out. Although it's short, it delivers the same amount of pleasure as any other series. 
 
I guess you'd have to have some twisted taste but it's simple yet, creative plot was entertaining to watch. I found myself laughing because of how random some scenes were. For example, in the first episode (this isn't a spoiler) the way they portray how decisions in the past have affected the modern world was so funny; no other way to word it. Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison and even Shakespeare were featured comedically. It's a refreshing break from the usual ""serious"" atmosphere given off of a slice of life series.  
 
Initially, this anime seems rather stupid and pointless.. and i'm not denying it. It was completely ridiculous (in a good way XD) But, i couldn't help but fall in love with the characters and the art. Although they included so many different personalities, i didn't find it confusing at all.  
 
The story revolves around Amakusa Kanade, just your average student blessed with an unimaginable curse that requires him to decide between two choices on the spot otherwise suffering from severe migraines. Might i say, the choices he has to decide between on a daily basis are equally ridiculous everytime.  
 
 Despite all his efforts of leading a normal life, he is labelled as a pervert, weirdo and even ""imouto-fyer"" (lol that one made me laugh) The rest of his gang (a.k.a. The Fail Five) are composed of an overly conscious tsundere with a odd sense of humour- always coming up with the weirdest puns, a spunky and cheerful airhead, and a mysteriously glutinous girl who fell from the sky claiming to be his pet sent from heaven to help him lift his curse?  
 
What i liked: 
- the art was on point 
- the variety of characters (epecially Yukihira)

    Story: so the story for this is actually pretty basic honestly it basically starts where hinako is very shy and if anyone approaches her or even talks to her she ends up turning into a scarecrow so to get rid of that fear she decides to go to Tokyo and hopefully join a theater club in hopes of getting rid of her shyness and such.  
 
Art: Art is very good usually don't talk a lot about this usually its kept short with this and sound art again though was pretty good. 
 
Sound: the OP and ED are meh to me to be honest not the best in the world but decent at best also the characters all sounded good as well. 
 
Character: Hinako is the really shy one of the bunch and again like i said she cant really talk if anyone even approaches her or even talk to her she does mature as the anime goes on and she is really nice and sweet. Kuina she is a well the hungry person of the anime she thinks about food a lot and even eats the books at the store otherwise pretty up and going. Mayuki is a person who likes wearing maid outfits and costumes as well also has really good feelings for Chiaki otherwise pretty much a nice and sweet girl. Chiaki is the landlord of Hitotose and is also the last main of the anime she is really well liked otherwise a quiet talker also nice as the rest of the characters. Yua (also yes im gonna add a supporting character even though i dont really talk about them) so she basically has feeling for Chiaki and also kinda becomes Hinako's rival becuase of her getting the lead in a play when she felt like she should of had it but she opens up later to hinako otherwise a tsundere easily. 
 
Enjoyment: i personally really enjoyed this anime like a lot more than i though i would this anime is really and i mean REALLY funny like episodes 4 through 6 were kinda meh but the rest were easily very good and a good sitting to watch as well. 
 
Overall: Easily a 8 for me yes it was that good i could understand that yes this anime does have gimmicks going for it like you'll easily notice them right away when you watch it but honestly that didn't bother me like at all unlike other people or the more popular reviewers because i could understand but this anime was hella funny for me and easily worth the watch

    Better than the first season, but still lacking. 
 
At least this time around they're actually doing something.  This might be a relatively short review, but here goes: 
 
Overall, I gave it a 6/10: Fair.  There were a few factors that worked really well in the series but it was held back by the two most important ones: Story and Characters.  We might as well talk about those first. 
 
Characters: 5/10 
Oh man are they all over the place. 
 
LtCol Guren does redeem himself a bit in this season.  He comes off a bit more as a competent commander of a special unit, whereas there were just some actions in the first season that made him look like a joke.  That's something I just cannot get over.  One moment he's serious, and the next he's extremely immature.  It seems like the writers could not grasp a hold of the actual character.  Furthermore, they could have really done more to explain his relationship with his demon weapon.  You'll have to see it to know what I mean, but they barely covered it, leaving no effect on the audience whatsoever. 
 
Yoichi: Classic goodie-two-shoes. God I hate these worthless people.  Yoichi, during the series is portrayed as a competent squad member with high talent.  Okay, he does do a few things in combat that makes him not completely suck, but he's such a bland character that lacks strength and doesn't really have an emphasized level of intelligence either.  His only redeeming quality is that he is a supportive, good person. Bleh. 
 
Shinoa: I did like her since the first season.  She's witty and antagonizing towards the main characters.  She's usually a decent Squad Leader, yet this season, and bits of the first one, she had a few lapses.  I guess they're still kids afterall.  Perhaps it's good writing to have the viewer both like and dislike the character in some ways, or maybe its that they can't decide on one personality for them. 
 
The other squad members: Barely existed this season. Definitely true for Mitsuba, and I can't really think of much to write about Kimizuki. Enough said. 
 
Mika: Not too much to judge wrong with this character, though later on in the series, you run into a very BL interaction moment.  As we recall, Mika hates humans and hates vampires.  He hates everybody and is very conflicted.  You don't really get an idea of what he wants, other than the obvious, saving Yu. And even then, you don't really get an idea of how. 
 
Krul:  Alright, I must admit, I'm tired of the common vampires, zombies, werewolves, etc that are just flooding the fiction/fantasy world.  Krul is probably among 2 vampires that I actually like/pay any attention to.  (The other, of course is everyone's favorite little donut eating blonde).  There is definitely something intriguing about Krul's body language, her tone of voice and her special treatment of Mika. Plus, she's pretty hot, and not just because she's 2D.  She's confident, (obviously because she's the vampire queen), and you don't want to piss her off.  Ah, finally, another decent vampire character. 
 
Hiiragi Shinya: He was also a pretty decent character. Skilled, cocky with a chip in his shoulder, at first you think he's extremely shady, but redeems himself immensely as the story goes on.  Not a bad dude. 
 
Also, there's quite a few minor characters that were present for an episode or two here and there.  Some I liked, some I didn't, and others I thought were used the wrong way in the story. 
 
But, one of the ones I hated most of all: 
Yuuichirou. 
MAIN CHARACTER SYNDROME.  His wiki entry should read, ""blah blah generic adolescent main character with typical main character haircut who is hot headed and wants revenge.  Between the first season and this one, he has rediscovered his idea of family, the people he wants to protect?  Is that really the only development he has? Really, that's it? ARGH! that's so overdone!  Also, he's a complete idiot.  You see him do things that completely endanger himself, the squad and the rest of the unit.  He just doesn't drop it.  Yuuichirou sucks. 
 
Story: 5/10 
 
So while the first season pretty much was just an establishment, in this season the humans and vampires actually go into organized combat... For one battle anyway. Yes, the entire season pretty much focuses on the events of ONE battle.  Alright, that might not always be terrible, as there were some pretty good war movies out there about singular engagements.  But at least you get to finish those in one 2-hour sitting.  Not that I don't like battle scenes, but in an entire season, they could have honestly inserted more content. 
 
Otherwise, the story was completely disjointed. Alright, so what developments occurred to influence the actions of Krul Tepes and Guren Ichinose?  Where did ""Owari no Seraph"" come from?  Why did it turn out to be (spoilers)?  Since when were the Hiiragi brass planning to enact their master plan?  None of this was covered in any detail or explained properly. 
 
Also, not enough death occurred. 
 
Now onto the two factors that worked in favor of a good rating for Owari no Seraph: Art & Sound. 
 
Art: 7/10 
It's 2016. Good art in this day and age shouldn't be an astounding accomplishment.  Flashy effects, decent drawing and animation, plus one detailed scene of Shinoa that made me bite my lip.  Otherwise, they didn't try anything really new or groundbreaking. 
 
Sound: Again, 7/10 
They did actually put together a good soundtrack.  In particular, the ED and some of the OSTs. You have to pay attention during a lot of the combat scenes to realize how well the OSTs are used. 
 
Finally, enjoyment and overall score: 
 
Despite the most crucial elements of the series falling very short (scattered story and mediocre characters), there's something that kept me watching. Maybe it was the industry standard placement of a cliffhanger at the end of every.single.episode, or the constant action.  Yeah, they didn't do too bad there.  I mean, if the show were not at least decent, or even good, I would not have been able to binge it over the course of one night and the following morning. 
 
I give enjoyment and the series an overall score of 6/10.  The first season was much worse, trust me.  If you've seen that, I suppose you might as well watch this season to make up for it.

    Unholy burger and fries. I would sure love to try them. 
 
Supreme comedy. That’s what Hataraku Maou-sama is. I like to split the comedy genre into two types when it comes to it and the anime series in general: the first one is the comedy flow that is present through the entire series. It is there to make the series a tad lighter, to bring some more energy and by chance, to make us smile every once in a while. The second one, however, tends to focus on separate scenes rather than bringing the quirky atmosphere. It focuses on jokes and scenes that make us not only smile, but laugh. From sadistic to well-planned situations alike, that would be the general purpose of the second type - making us laugh. 
 
Hataraku Maou-sama is the second type. Furthermore, it is extremely successful. 
 
The series’ start is quite dark and serious, but if you’ve taken a look at the genres and read the synopsis, then you can guess that it doesn’t stay like that for long. We are presented to the situation that went down in the world of Ente Isla, the world in which our main characters originally lived in. After the great Satan Lord Jacob gets defeated by Hero Emilia, he, alongside with his fellow General Alsiel, is forced to pull back and escape. Just before departure, Jacob swears that he will return and regain control over Ente Isla once more. They open up a dimensional portal and go through it, not knowing that Emilia has followed them. 
 
Right after all the seriousness is gone, the fun begins. 
 
Yes, right after that. Of course, the world in which our two demons have landed on is Earth. Japan, to be specific. The first thing they realize is that they cannot regenerate magic in this world, and since they’ve used most of it up for opening the portal, magic becomes one of many things they have to go easy on from that point on. I could go on and on about what happens to them, but I wouldn’t want to spoil much, since it would truly be best for you to see it for yourself. 
 
On short, our main characters that come from Ente Isla must now blend in the everyday life of a human. That includes getting a job, paying for everyday expenses, and so on. Does that sound a bit boring? Well, that’s far from it. Besides being spiced up with some amazing comedy on every corner, supernatural activity comes in as well. Our lead characters are attacked! They are being pursued! Is this the time to be worried about them? No. It is the time for you to laugh to your heart’s desire, since every scene is presented either in a badass, or funny way. 
 
Through the story, we are presented to more and more new characters, most of them coming from Ente Isla themselves. After being “tamed” by our original main leads, they settle down on Earth as well, each of them living their lives in their own way. From working and having a job, being a housewife (housedude?), all the way to being a lazy NEET. 
 
Since most of the angels that come from Ente Isla are female, while the demons are male, you can get a picture of what kind of pacts are made. It is a wide-known saying that us, men, have no weapons against women, so the only thing we can do for us to prevail is stick together. Our demons do just that. Closely. On the start, Jacob and Alsiel rent quite a small apartment, barely containing enough space for the two already. But no, things get only (worse) funnier. One more demon comes and after being tamed and proven weaker, that little apartment becomes a smaller strongholds of idiots, so to speak. 
 
And so, our supernatural peeps head towards their everyday issues, with comedy awaiting us on every single corner. 
 
Focusing a little bit on other components as well, the art and sound are splendid. The art is really attractive, making the characters quite adorable for the eye to see (yeah, you get to love those pixels in front of you). Not to mention the great display of various actions, such as the all-lovable trollface out of nowhere. All in all, it presents the story in a great way. The sound fits in excellently. What is left to make us laugh besides the animation and the text? Of course, the way the text is spoken and delivered! I must compliment the voice actors here. They have all done a really good job at emphasizing the characters’ emotions through voice, especially their common outbursts. A special shout-out goes to Ryota Ohsaka here, who is voicing our MC, Jacob, and has done it right all the way. Taking the scene in which Jacob is screaming on Alsiel: “You’re freaking right you’re late! It’s all over, why do you even bother showing up now!?” , I can say it is just presented in a way that I couldn’t find a better one, in all honesty. 
 
The characters make the show. Alongside with the scenes they get caught in, we get to sympathize with them, we take them as some stupid idiots, we want to see them get stormed-over more, and so on. On short, we want more of each and every single one of them. It’s one of those rare cases where the stupid characters in some series aren’t annoying. The catch is that they are not mainstream. Far from that. They are totally unique, and their stupidity is unique as well. It reaches levels far beyond. Well, from everything I’ve written so far, I think you can guess what my enjoyment is like. It is pumping high. Very high. 
 
Overall, Hataraku Maou-sama is stupid. There is not a single quality focus in the series. However, it is still grand. Oh yes, it is. In all honesty, I cannot remember the last time that I’ve had such good laughs during watching some anime series, but I sure will remember Hataraku Maou-sama for a long period of time. Very worth the watch. Heck, if you haven’t seen it yet, make sure to emphasize its priority to the maximum if you’ll ever feel like watching some great comedy. Extremely suggested.

    Golden Kamuy is one of those anime that I think are undeniably entertaining, but I ultimately don’t have much to say about it. It’s not exactly in depth or memorable as some of the other anime this season, but it’s definitely good. I can’t deny that. At the same time, there are no particular scenes that stand out, no characters that I was truly interested in, and a plot that really doesn’t go anywhere. Despite all of that, I am still able to say Golden Kamuy was fun. If I had to pick an aspect of the anime that was memorable, it’d be that it was funnier than I was expecting it to be. I don’t have much to say about the any of the main cast outside of their basic descriptions you could get off of a wiki page. There weren’t any bad character at the very least. Oh, I almost forgot about the CGI Bears. A lot of people think they looked weird and out of place. Those people would be right. I just found it funny each time and was looking forward to seeing how it’d find a way into an episode. While the last episode was probably the least enjoyable of the 12, I can appreciate the fact that the episode announced that the 2nd season would be airing in October. It really makes up for the lackluster season finale.

    Very rarely do you come across an anime that not only tugs at the heartstrings, but also leaves you in stitches. Very rarely is there an anime that has serious heart, yet takes itself lightheartedly as well. Very rarely do you find an anime as balanced as Welcome to the NHK, which somehow manages to not only have some of the best comedy episodes of any anime, but also some of the best drama episodes. It is a very strange specimen to dissect because it has so many different elements, all of which are fantastically executed. That’s not to say this anime is without faults, because it, inevitably, does have a few areas where it is weak. 
 
The plot centers around a hikikomori (or shut-in) named Sato. He lives alone in a tiny apartment, doesn’t work, and seems to be a little bit insane, blaming his whole failure of a life on conspiracies. When the college drop-out is chosen by a high school drop-out named Misaki to be part of a special project, he reluctantly agrees and winds up going on a series of pretty strange adventures. At first, Sato tries to get out of these special meetings with Misaki by saying he has a job and is going to be successful. By using his next door neighbor and best friend Yamazaki, Sato convinces her that they are working on a gal game. The duo do begin to work together on a game and this begins Sato’s strange adventures. The first story arc where Sato learns about internet porn, finds himself obsessed with gal games, and learns of anime stores is some of the funniest freaking animation I’ve ever seen. It’s very dark humor that may not be acceptable to the tastes of some, but I found to be absolutely hilarious. The series doesn’t ever match that humor in the proceeding episodes, but still maintains a certain dark humor about it that is borderline depressing. Sato winds up meeting with a girl he had a “thing” with in high school who takes him to a suicide party, he gets obsessed with online video gaming, and he winds up caught in a pyramid scheme. While looking at it from Sato’s standpoint during the episodes, these things aren’t funny. But after everything is said and done and you can look back at the series, you realize just how funny all of these things really are. They’re funny in a more depressing way, and the series points this out toward the end. And, as I said, you can look back and laugh at it, but it’s a mild laugh because sitting over all of that humor are some rather weighty and in-your-face lessons and issues. 
 
What I truly appreciate is how these issues are handled. Welcome to the NHK is not like most anime where the characters pull some happy simile or metaphor from their ass with which to explain things away and make you feel good. You can go away from a lot of anime learning lessons, though they are typically bullshit like “You can be what you want to be” or “As long as you do your best, it’s okay”. You leave Welcome to the NHK with lessons such as “Life is meaningless” and “You’re going to spend ninety percent of your life depressed and unhappy”. It’s depressing (thanks for contributing to the ninety percent anime). This is compounded with the lives of two characters, rather normal lives to tell the truth, who have gone through so much that they have given up. Sato’s story isn’t substantial or fantastical like so many other anime stories, his story is rather normal. He dropped out of college, has social issues, and can’t handle himself. Hell, I have social issues, so I could relate to that. And every time he attempts to do something he fails. Well, I can relate to that, I’ve failed a million times and have felt depressed because of it. Misaki has issues as well, stemming from her childhood and upbringing. Together, they are strong. Divided, they fall. It’s not a very hard concept to understand, nor are any of the concepts of the show. Welcome to the NHK does what very few seem to have the balls to do; it provides realistic and down to Earth concepts that while depressing, are reality. It doesn’t sugarcoat it. It just tells us “Life’s a bitch, then you die”. 
 
And what I appreciate more than the bluntness of the lessons is how you can’t help but enjoy yourself watching it. You never feel depressed. The depression comes afterward. And that’s why this anime is so successful in what it does. It’s violently entertaining to the very end, then leaves you with a dark cloud over your head after everything is over. 
 
Reality is rarely a subject of anime considering it’s…well, not reality. But Welcome to the NHK handles reality with such grace and style, maintaining the illusion of a cartoon while being the weightiest anime I’ve ever seen. 
 
The grace doesn’t translate to great animation though. While it is dated because…duh, it’s older, the animation seems to take a turn for the worse at certain portions. Most of the show maintained the same appearance, though one scene at Kobayashi’s house kind of fell apart and looked really bad. 
 
But the grace does translate to an excellent soundtrack. The opening and closing do not disappoint, while the series has a strong series of songs playing during the show. One of the smaller things I enjoyed about Welcome to the NHK was the fact it never had any breaks of awkward silence. It had music during conversations and all other scenes. And, as odd as this sounds, music does make a show much more enjoyable and fun to watch. A lot of anime have tracks during the show, but they only play at key moments and it’s typically pretty simple to tell when a piece will play (case in point: Shiki). But having a good soundtrack that persists throughout keeps things so much more enjoyable. 
 
And on top of that, I thought the English dub was pretty good. I saw no major hiccups, nor bad voice acting for the most part. 
 
Of course, as stated, the characters are really good. Sato and Misaki play off each other well, and the romance that seems to develop (though doesn’t go anywhere) is entertaining to watch. Sato’s falling into various forms of insanity is fantastically executed, and the ability of Misaki and Sato to be crutches for each other ascertains a long standing friendship that transcends the screen. 
 
Yamazaki is a fun character as well. With a serious collection of gal games and anime figures, he is both comedic relief, and a character you can grow to care for. While he is no way on the level of Sato as far as character development, he is still a very well rounded and entertaining guy. 
 
The other characters all serve their purpose well and are usually just as much fun as the main characters. I didn’t particularly find Kobayashi as entertaining a character as the others, but that’s because I just flat out didn’t like her. 
 
Overall, Welcome to the NHK deals with a variety of weighty issues from suicide to depression with a finesse rarely seen in any medium. It manages to make these things entertaining, and even funny, but still maintains that weightiness I spoke of that leaves you thinking about how meaningless your life truly is. It’s really hard to explain how the series does this, as I’m sure those who haven’t seen it don’t understand how depression and suicide can be made both entertaining yet depressing, but I assure you that after watching Welcome to the NHK, you’ll see. 
 
Welcome to the NHK is very unique and I assure you that if you’re looking for entertainment that also manages to give you a reason to hate the world, you’ve come to the right place.

    Pain has been given a name; and it’s Battle Royal High School.  Granted I wasn’t going into my experience of this anime with high expectations of quality, but for God's sake is it too much to ask for a story that makes even the most teensy-weensy bit of sense? 
 
I usually begin my reviews with an analysis of the story.  Unfortunately after watching it I just don’t get it.  Now perhaps if I did something crazy like subject myself to a second viewing I might find an unexpected bonus of plot, sort of like the toy surprise at the bottom of a box of cereal, but who am I kidding?  I love myself far too much to do that.   
 
However what I did manage to piece together is that Hyoudo is in high school and he’s really good at karate.  I will let it pass that despite being in high school he looks like he’s in his 30s and is built like an East German bodybuilder.  Hey Hyoudo, save some steroids for the rest of the world would ya?  Anyway Hyoudo has the very shounen goal of being the world’s strongest fighter and after kicking the crap out of his own schools karate club so he could quit and then fight other schools club members, Hyoudo gets his wish. (Just close your eyes and count to three, this isn’t supposed to make sense I guess)  Conveniently there is a resident tsundere who despite being one fifth his size can kick his ass and keep him in check.  This is when things take a turn for the bizarre.  Suddenly a demon lord from another dimension enters the story and joins bodies with Hyoudo so he can do battle with other strange inter-dimensional beings, monsters, and future spacemen.  Thus Battle Royal High School is able to combine the holy trinity of shounen action of GAR hand-to-hand combat, sword fighting, and power suits with monsters, gore, and plenty of underage T&A. 
 
As far as pure action goes, this anime isn’t all that bad.  The fights are fairly entertaining if not amusing for their downright ridiculousness.  The gore is over the top and the blood is spilled by the liter.  These are all pretty much staples of the genre, and this show does nothing new to set it apart.  The story fails completely though as mentioned.  Really nothing is really explained, the ending is barely adequate. 
 
It’s a bit redundant to call the characters in Battle Royal High School clichéd.  That much is obvious, however one of the most unbelievable things to accept about the show was just how the characters looked.  In particular some of the male characters that in some cases looked like old men who have no business being high school students.  It’s difficult to talk about any of them because there is little time spent developing them.  The action just moves from fight to fight and about the only thing we learn about any of them is the meek girl Megumi, who secretly pines for the meat headed Hyoudo. 
 
For a 80s era show the art isn’t bad at all.  The action is drawn and animated pretty well, as is the blood and gore.  Typical of this era the gore is drawn with a healthy portion of bubbly intestines and spewing blood.  It’s a bit silly looking but I kind of like the style.  The characters are pretty silly looking, with the men all being typical muscle bound shounen beefcakes and the girls looking suitable demure and feminine. 
 
About the nicest thing I can say about the musical performances is that they are...dated.  Its typical Engrish mid 80s rock music, and the ending song in particular is a perfect example of the kind of bands that have been left to the dustbin of history.  I would say the acting is as equally horrible but given how shitty the music is that’s probably not very fair. 
 
In conclusion, all but the most diehard shounen and martial arts action fans should stay clear of this anime turd.  There might be some nostalgia in it for some older fans and maybe some lulz for others.  This is a public service I provide for you, I watch bad anime so you don’t have too.

    This season is really underrated 
 
Story (6) 
This whole premise is about an organization known as DATS who capture wild digimon and take them to the Digital World. For the first third of the season starts out bland and just your typical ""MOW"" (Monster of the week) formula, by episode 13. You finally could take the show seriously the second third of season just focus on their exploration of the Digital World and we found out more on how Digimon is roaming into the human world and meet our antagonist of the show, Karata. He plans to whipe out all the Digimon with his man made Digimon known as Gizumon. The Gizumon comes from Digimon DNA except he doesn't have a heart. His plot were actually totally devious. Now the third half is where they jumped the shark. Honestly the King Drasil (mind you I watched the dub) Arc was quite boring. Granted, it was okay that we get to know more about Kudamon and we find out that he's was a Royal Knight by his Mega Level Kentarosmon. But aside from that I wasn't amazed from this Arc. That where Data Squad (Savers) suffered. 
 
Characters (9) 
Each character pretty much developed alot. Marcus started off as a reckless jerk with no type of common sense. But later on he realizes that he can't just rely on his fist all the time. Thomas started as a douchebag by just being a smartass. But he gets much nicer at later on. He even had to trick his friends just to save his own sister. I can't say much about Yoshi except she becomes more friendly.. But that's it. Now Keenan had the most. He started as a kid who hated Digimon we soon realizes their was a reason to it. His Digi-mother Frigimon was killef by Gizumon. Merucimon and Marcus convinces him that human aren't bad. At the end of the day, Keenan becomes more forgiving to humans except Karata. 
 
Art (6): 
The animation aren't that bad. The CGI in the evolution sequences weren't bad. 
 
Music (5): 
When watching the dub the sounds are so generic asf.

    Shikabane Hime is a action horror hybrid from Gainax. It centers around undead girls who are given a chance to enter heaven if they fight and kill other undead. Equal parts exhilarating and disturbing, Shikabane Hime feels like a shounen with heavy horror undertones. This combination is what makes the show worth watching, especially in its later stages, despite its numerous shortcomings. Just for the record, this review covers both seasons: Aka and Kuro. 
 
Shikabane are monsters born of strong regrets a person might have when they die. Ageless, powerful, and bearing an animosity towards the living, shikabane are a threat to mankind. The only line of defense against them is the Kougun Sect, who employ the use of undead girls, called shikabane hime, to eliminate shikabane under the supervision of a contracted monk. If a shikabane hime is able to kill 108 shikabane, then they can enter into heaven. Makina Hoshimura is a shikabane hime with a vendetta and a strong bond with her contracted monk, Keisei Kagami. However, things begin to unhinge when Keisei's adopted younger brother, Ouri, becomes involved in the secret battle between shikabane and the Kougun Sect; a battle neither Keisei nor Makina want him to be involved with. 
 
 
The show starts off with an episodic ""monster of the week"" type deal. These opening episodes are in the same vein as Vampire Princess Miyu (the TV anime, not OVA), with our heroin hunting down and destroying shikabane; just done much better than Vampire Princess Miyu, namely because of the more exciting fights. At the same time, the show follows Ouri as he slowly finds out about shikabane and the Kougun Sect. These episodes are the show's weakest because while the fights are all good, the scenarios are hit-or-miss, and time with Ouri is usually dull. Luckily, the show starts getting better mid-way through the first season, when Ouri gets deeply involved with one shikabane hime, having tragic consequences. Characters get some god character development: Ouri struggles with the fact that shikabane hime are dead, Keisei laments Ouri's increasing involvement with shikabane, and Makina's reasons for being a shikabane hime and past with Keisie are relieved. All the while, the viewer is treated to more grotesque scenes of horror and gleefully violent action sequences. Near the end of the first season the main antagonists, a group of shikabane called the Seven Stars (because there are seven of them), appear and aline with the previously introduced Traitor Monk Akasha. In retrospect, I wonder why they didn't do this earlier in the series, as it would have made the show more evenly paced. 
 
The second season, Kuro, moves at a break-neck speed compared to the first. It is so overstuffed with twists and plot revelations, there is no doubt the show as a whole could have been paced better. Still, it can't be accused of being boring. There is a certain shounen-esque excitement to having a villain league like the Seven Stars in the fray.It is fun to watch Makina take them on one at a time. There is also a lot more drama in this season, mainly concerning Makina and Ouri, which is pretty good; but also some drama involving minor characters which really doesn't go anywhere, just adding more fluff to the already cramped running time. 
 
One thing the show definitely could have handled better was its themes. The show deals a lot with death and regret, but scarcely actually explores them. There are a few occasions where it does, like at the end of both seasons, but for the most part the concepts of death and regret are thrown around like ""friendship"" and ""courage"" are in a typical shounen. There is also the issue of the relationship between shikabane hime and their contracted monks, which is somewhat like the Fratello in Gunslinger Girl (except including complications of having more matured bodies...), but handled far less maturely. Their relationships range from being as complex as the one between Makina and Keisei (and Ouri), to as simplistic and one dimensional as the one between Saki and Rika. One particularly nasty one is Minai and Itsaki, which is the equivalence of Jean and Rico from Gunslinger Girl, unfortunately does not get enough development (even though an extra episode was dedicated to them). 
 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the review, this is from Gainax, which means it is going to at least look decent. The show goes for a dark look, even with the vivid color pallet found in most Gainax series, with shading  which borders on unnatural but still suits the show well. Backgrounds are fairly well designed and characters have that certain cartoon-ish expressiveness you will usually find in a Gainax work; the shikabane are a bizarre looking bunch. There is also the copious amount of fan service we've come to expect from Gainax as of late. The animation is for the most part solid, a bit of spottiness here and there but nothing to complain about; the action scenes are treated well. The music does its job of controlling the atmosphere, especially during the tense moments, but honestly you are just not going to remember it. Not the best of Gainax's projects, but certainly not bad at all. 
 
Taken as an action horror, Shikabane Hime is a decent show. It doess have some major problems with its themes and pacing, which are honestly kind of a mess. However, if you are in the mood for violence, disturbing imagery, and maybe even some solid drama, then you might want to give Shikabane Hime a try.

    Having only watched 8 episodes of this I have to say that the show feels rushed. It's only 6 or 7 eps in that it finally has enough set up for it to really tell its story.  
 
The male MC is a typical commoner-with-a-will. Past that and he is quite flat for some time, ep 5 is where he actually starts to make his own plays.  
 
This show is not a battle show, the rushed first 4 epis are to get the MCs into a political location where they have enough there to have stakes in that arena. That being said, I am finding myself having to pay extremely close attention to every single line of dialogue and every action much closer than I normally would.  
 
Now that the show is into the political end of the spectrum it can drop a lot of the shorthand that it had been using to set everything up. Theo is effective in this in that he is as unaware of the politicalscape as the audience while actually being from the setting (avoiding isekai hell)  
 
Our other MC is trained from a very young age to be politically savvy as well as having potent magical skill. Her own goals align with Theo's but go considerably farther than his did in the beginning, having her be fresh out of school and thus socially unaware of the world, gives us the audience a good glimpse into the society in the setting as a whole.  
 
Now that we are past the ground block world building, we are looking at the political alliances that the MCs have found themselves entwined in. Where the focus has shifted off of our handy short-hand characters to much more rounded nobility who are rife with problems.  
 
Knowing that this series has 24 epis really helps in gauging the final scope.  
 
As this is a review, I will say that their execution of plot is adequate. You have to really look into what is going on to get it, but the plot is there. It's just not focused on the same thing as most anime are. Battles are not the climax of this plot. They are used to further it, as examples of what the war looks like, as ways to show how each of the Lords acts in combat to their own ideals, ethics, and codes of conduct.  
 
Animation is adequate, not top tier, and not utter shit. I have no opinion on the soundrack or use of music, so it's doing its job.  
 
I am finding myself enjoying this show quite a bit despite its flaws.

    I had my doubts for this movie and even more as it was reportedly a tribute for the the back to back titles: Bardock: the Father Of Goku, Fusion Reborn and Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan. Most ambitious projects tend to go overboard. Entering the cinema, I felt a sense of dread overcome me and wondered about my choices. However, by the start of the movie, I felt a bit relieved on seeing the animation and the art style. so far, it held up to my expectations. I lost track of time as the movie progressed and by the end of it, I was hoping of some post credits or a hint of return. 
 
TBH, this is one of the good anime movies in a long time with real spirits of its predecessors bursting with all glory and enthralled me. I was in love with the way the movie expands the horizon of the Saiyan history and the tale that begun so.  
 
I mostly judge everything i watch very harshly, but oh boy! Thank the Lord! The movie was brilliant and nearly brought DBS back to the roots of DBZ. The animations seems a bit odd considering how much time we spent of the Yamamuro and previous animators' style. However it's still a good tribute to the 90s style of DBZ. Broly is every way human and his antics remind me of the early days of Goku and Bulma (nostalgic AF). Cherlye also makes up for a helpful and concerned person in Paragus shoes. Paragus is blatantly the representations of Japanese Dad's from the 90s, (no offense) but it also implies how much potential is being wasted on the wrong thing and how much of restrictions could cause one to go berserk. 
The music is perfectly done and well synced. I found myself matching the tunes of the music and the art inspired me to rethink new possibilities for the rest of the DBS arc. 
 
This is an absolute treat. Watch it and you wont regret it. The background is so lively like its freaking real and shows more nature than before. I love it and I'm giving it a 10/10. 
Must watch!

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS** 
 
First chinese dubbed anime that I just finished watching, so the story's still fresh in my mind. I've seen bits of this anime in our local channel, back then it was already pretty interesting but I haven't been able to catch it always on tv. The plot is very interesting, centering around a 13 year old boy who has a magical touch when it comes to cooking. Like his mom, Mao believes cooking should be used to bring happiness to people, and this is the theme the story revolves in. One can't help but cheer for Mao as he goes through several tough cooking competitions. Ever watch the Ironchef Master show in Japan? This is the anime version. Man, I can't help but crave dimsums, fried rice, & other chinese food while watching this. What's interesting is that the show offers lots and lots of trivias about food -- I never realized till I watched it that there are lots of food that can actually improves our health! The characters are very well done, all of them are likeable and its more effective since it uses the bad-guy-turned-good-guy style, making us like the other characters that we thought annoying at first. The phasing of the series is great as well -- with each event getting more and more interesting as one watches. The parts I definitely like is the Super Chef competition. The Dark Society of the cooking chefs and the quest for the legendary utensils added that suspense factor, making it not just an ordinary cooking competition. The only thing that lessens the enjoyment a bit is the ending -- I was thinking there must be another chapter to this but its the end, apparently this is the case wherein the audience is left to imagine that Mao's group defeated their enemies, him accepting top chef position and finding all the legendary utensils. Its too bad since if they had just made it a bit longer, the ending would definitely be a happy ever after

    Based on the premise and quality of the art and animation, I really wanted to like this show. But even in just the prequel OVAs, there were some warning flags I really should have paid attention to, because they forecasted the subtext of the rest of the series pretty well. 
 
In the fewest words possible, Ancient Magus' Bride is a quintessential girls' escapist fantasy. In a sense, it's a bit like Sword Art Online in that it knows its target audience very well, and feeds them exactly what they want to see. In the case of Ancient Magus' Bride, this generally revolves around ""a unique power that makes you misunderstood and miserable"", ""a male benefactor who accepts and loves you for who you are"", and ""sacrificing your health, happiness, and well-being for the greater good makes people love and admire you"". 
 
I had a very difficult time just watching this show and accepting it for what it is, getting way too stuck on the tropes to enjoy the story it was trying to tell or the characters it was trying to develop. Whenever I was able to look past the patterns and just enjoy it for what it is, it was a perfectly okay time with hard-to-follow, magically-themed stories of some intensity, charming-if-cliche characters in Chise and Elias as they experience this weird quasi-marital relationship, and generally beautiful art.

    by far, the greatest manga and anime series is Clannad after story, i went into the series as a person who didn't expect much from a series which was light-hearted and innocent. the original series Clannad was not amazing but i still wanted to continue watching it had character development like no other. 
 
it was moving, inspirational, and incredibly re-watchable. from last year alone i have re-watched this anime, building such connections to the main characters i now fully associate myself with them. it was also the second show that made me cry in my life. and to be perfectly honest, i hadn't cried for 4 years before watching this show. the second show that made me cry was Elfen Lied but that's a different story. in all this show is given a 10/10 because of its amazing turn around from the original series and for the very confusing but amazing ending which could leave you questioning, happy or even disappointed.  
 
and to tell the truth the ending could make or break this for you. but try to live with it and think about it because the ending is beautiful and inspirational.

    I'm starting to see the appeal to the ""**** is like ****** but"" stamp, so I'll take a crack at it: 
 
Hundred is like Infinite Stratos but better. 
 
Let's begin: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Story: 
 
     No seriously, it's so similar! A guy that has high compatibility with his world's battle suits called ""Hundreds"", goes to an academy surrounded by water. There everyone's interested him, a snobby girl fight scene, a cross dresser, etc. 
 
Details, details, details. 
 
But Hundred seems to have a stronger story than Infinite Stratos, and also has elements from Strike Witches, Freeze, and Seraph of the End (believe it or not) 
 
 
 
     In a world where destructive creatures called Savages wreck havoc all over the planet (from time to time), a special unit of people called Slayers are trained and sent out to fight these monsters. 
  
There's a catch! Coming in contact with these monsters gives you the risk of being infected by a virus the creatures hold. Which can either kill you or turn you into a Variant. Which is like a Slayer but generates more energy into their weapons and combat abilities, and are likely to go into a murder frenzy! So their like a rival faction/race of sorts, and that's pretty cool. 
 
Now this happened to our main character (Kisaragi, Hayato) and his childhood friend(Crossfode, Emile), which explains the main character's edge or high compatibility to his Hundred. 
 
I like how the anime gave context to his abilities. He wasn't related to some legendary slayer, and he didn't need it in order to get into an academy. The only reason he's at the academy in the first place, is for the medical treatment he can get for his little sister. 
 
So and we're off on our college-military life with the anime taps turned up a good amount. 
 
 
 
     Now where I feel the anime suffers, is how shifty the tone can get. 
 
Are we watching a main character suffering from the past where he and his childhood friend are almost killed by a monster that infects them with a virus they could have died from or lost their sanity to? 
 
Nah, he's learned to deal with it pretty quickly, as opposed to crowds interested in him and women's flirtatious advances! 
 
Are we watching the main character try and come to terms with a virus that's slowly eating at his lust for the power to not lose a fight, or are we watching another wacky harem scenario? 
 
Nah, he gets control of it rather quickly. 
 
Are we in a world where kids are purposefully subjected to the virus of Savages in order to manufacture super soldiers, then promptly dying or going insane if they don't have a role in the plot? 
 
Yep, moving on~ 
 
Maybe everyone's wearing a mask just to stay strong and turn life into a cliched anime, because the atmosphere has trouble staying consistent sometimes. It never broke my immersion, so that's good. But it's best to keep an eye on tone from now on. 
 
 
 
The story does have a sliver of uniqueness as the anime goes on, but if thought Infinite Stratos was forgettable: this anime only slightly alleviates that. It does set up for another season nicely around the ending, so be on the look out for those hints or the anime will feel like their's too many loose ends. 
 
Such examples being some lone talented scientist out for revenge, harsh environments for kids, people with high authority keeping secrets, cross dressing for a reason, you know the drill. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Art: 
 
     ""Oh boy, an anime not CGing it's balls off~!"" 
 
*watches the last few episodes* 
 
     ""Spoke to freaking soon~!"" 
 
 
 
Am I the only one who finds 3d objects in a 2d environment jarring? And vice versa? 
 
No? 
 
Then the CG popping in, and watching 2d characters fight said CG is jarring! 
 
 
Not as bad as Infinite Stratos though. I guess the Chief Animation Directors must have been fighting with their own inner Variants. Having a strong enough will power to keep CG's greasy mitts off the characters using their mechanical Hundred parts in fights and CG's muddy feet off the environment, but not enough will power to resist using it on throw-away-enemies or helicopters around the end of the series! 
 
It was jarring when the Prince of Egypt did it, it was jarring when Spiderman's animated series did it, and it's not about to change because it's an anime! 
 
That said, when the anime behaves itself: the animations are pretty damned detailed. Not the art, the animations. The subtle movements of people interacting as opposed to standing stark still needs to be commended. I love anyone who thinks of the little things when making an anime. 
 
The art style on the other hand, still does that fanservice bit where no matter what your wearing: if you have big tits or thick thighs, they're gonna reflect light off them like the military-school uniforms were oiled up. 
 
Now I'm no harrumphing prude; I hunted down a pervy comic the moment I finished the series. But it sure would be nice to see an anime save such glossy appearances for when your actually showing off fan service, and not make the pervy points of interest look saran wrapped. Save that for the body suits, like you have been. 
 
Still, the art style itself (or the character design) looks really good. Norie Tanaka did a swell job, to say he's mostly been an animator. You may recognize his handy work from that one episode in Fairy Tail and those few episodes from Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sound: 
 
     The ambient music seems to be the only music I like. The opening theme's tone reminded me of Date A Live's opening theme, and not in a good way. It came off a bit misplaced, since the tone of the series itself is so shifty. What the opening seemed to be going for here, was how the characters were all struggling with something and the atmosphere always weighed down on everyone, but they had fight on and stay together to make a better tomorrow. 
 
And if the anime stuck with that, and not made a check box of pervy and romantic cliches, I'd be alright. 
 
So the opening left me trying to skip past it sometimes. 
 
The ending shifted between three different songs as the series progressed. This is what I enjoyed over the opening, as it did fit the tone a bit better. The clicks or groups within the series sang songs that fit their characters for the ending themes, and that vibes well with me. It feels as if the characters are growing are experiencing different things as time goes on, and that should be commended. 
 
 
 
As for the voice actors, I loved them~ 
 
Everyone fit their characters, except the rival Variant faction who had a kid who was voiced by someone quite older than the character's design suggested. He was skinnier and smaller than the main character, but spoke as if they were around the same age. 
 
If it were intentional like in Black Butler: Book of Circus (you know the two characters I'm talking about), than I'd have no problem. But since I got no such vibe, it was surprising. 
 
Other than that, it was nice to recognize other character's voices. Like how the main character's voice sounds like Muneakira from Hyakka Ryōran Samurai Girls, but was the actor who played as the knight from Rage of Bahamut: Genesis. It helped keep me invested as these characters were kept alive in a way by the talented voice actors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Character: 
 
     Girl One: ""We act so close because we've been together since we were kids. We're childhood friends."" 
 
     Girl Two: *gasp* ""That means I'm childhood friends with him too~!"" 
 
     Girl One: Ha! No, you only spent a day with him as a child. It's not the same."" 
 
     Me: ""Pfft, dayum!!!"" 
 
 
 
That's how I experienced that moment between the two love interests competing. I get a kick out of the boldness everyone demonstrates towards the main character. 
 
There's no CARDINAL SIN Tsundere whooping @$$ over the mistakes the main character makes. Nope, everyone must have realized this is an anime and so perversion is treated as a joke that everyone is in on. 
 
It's like the cast is one big party, and everyone is invited. Giving me quite a good time. If I had to compare it anime cast wise: it's like Tokyo Ravens and Hyakka Ryōran Samurai Girls were dripped into the creation, and made everyone bold without being out of character. 
 
     While voice actors did their parts, the characters that were sided in late in the game came off pretty stale or generic. They had no soul; they were just their. I'll let you see what I'm talking about as you get further into the anime. 
 
But yeah, thumbs up for the cast this time around! 
 
 
 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
     Here's what you're gonna enjoy. You're gonna like the bold characters, CG not detaching you from the action scenes, good characters, attentive animations here and there, and unique art style. 
 
What you're not gonna like is the CG coming out last minute as if it's a cop out, no new character types, heavily cliched, shifty tone, loose ended story elements, and fan service laid on thick. 
 
In short, nothing new here. It rises above one of it's popular predecessors (Infinite Stratos), but not far enough to make it's own identity. 
 
It seemed to have lost a bit of steam when crossing the 12 episode finish line due trying to hit a target audience and not trying anything new, but it shouldn't be a waste of time should you pick it up. 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall: 
 
     The final verdict for Hundred, is a 7 out of 10. 
 
     Overall, it's just another typical anime. It focused enough on it's elements  to not be average, but I felt it lost a lot of potential somewhere along the line. Maybe the visual novel has what the anime lacks, but at this point in time, after watching all 12 episodes, I'm just not thrilled. I'm not at the edge of my seats. I'm happy with the time I gave it and might rewatch the series in bursts, But not buy the disc sets. 
 
I hope you enjoyed my review, I know I don't put a lot of these out, but thanks for reading, and I'll see you all next time~

    This show is so underrated. I usually dont watch shows with score under 8, but this one deserves so much better.I thought this was just anotheraverage slice of life anime but I was so wrong. l Its very smart and interesting. There is no single annoying character and fan service moments. Situations are so realistic that you can identify your self in them cause you surely experienced something similar.Main character Hachiman is so well written. I like psychological approach, the way Hachiman analyzes almost every single person and their reaction. Plot development is a bit slow but I enjoyed  every episode and I am very hard to amuse. I give it 9/10 cause soundtrack is not memorable and art is medicore . One of the best anime this spring season.

    TL:DR 
If you liked K-on this delivers more of the same quality 
 
I marathoned K-On seasons 1 and 2 as well as the ovas over the span over a week or so. The ending of the second season, for lack of a better word, fucked me up. K-On, although it is just about cute girls drinking tea and occasionally playing music, had tons of great characters and development for them which made it hurt even more for it to end. This movie made it worse. 
 
Spoilers regarding the end of season 2 as well as some stuff that is talked about at the end of this movie (there's a part later on that becomes spoiler free) 
Honestly the scene where HTT plays their final song for Azusa was a really nice send off for the show, but this movie adds more context to the song. Of course there is tons of context delivered throughout the show but since I, and I'm assuming most other people here, can't understand Japanese so we have no idea what the lyrics mean. Towards the end of the movie the process behind creating the song is shown as the Light Music Club plays the song. I have no shame in admitting that i teared up because of this. KyoAni you glorious bastards well done. 
 
End of Spoilers 
Overall let me just explain the ratings I put for each category that this site allows me to. 
Story: 9/10 
Pretty good, does everything it needs to do as well as giving some nice closure. 
Art: 10/10 
If you thought K-On looked good then this movie made it better. Holy shit is KyoAni good at animation. 
Sound: 9/10 
The songs that were done were good and there were no issues with the sound. 
Characters: 10/10 
It's the same characters as from the show. More screen time for them is never a bad thing. 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Pretty self explanatory. Great movie and great closure. 
Overall: 10/10 
If you liked K-On and haven't seen this, you're missing out. Do it, you won't regret it.

    What would you do if you had a Death Note? What if somebody just started murdering every single criminal out there? These are the questions Death Note answers, or more accurately, lets you answer for yourself. Death Note is amazing.  I don't even know where to start. The art is fantastic, I love it. Character models are quite detailed and animation is pretty good. I can't stop listening to the soundtrack. The songs are varied and the only song that was out of place was the second opening, which sucked by the way. It is just so out of place. But those are just 2 songs (the ending one as well) so I don't care as much (The first opening is amazing, I just want to clarify that. It's my ringtone as of the time I am writing this review). L's theme, Light's theme, Low of Solipsism, the Death Note theme itself... so many great songs. But now to the more important part - the story. The story is suspensful, unique, with many plot twists. It is morally grey. It doesn't tell you ""this is good, that is bad"". The characters are sooooooo good! L is seriously one of the best characters ever in fiction. He is just so unique and is very inspiring. Light Yagami is also very unique. The other characters also are good. Ryuuk, Matsuda, Aizawa. Each character has their own backstory and personality, as well as motivations. They also have their own morals and they do have some evil in them. Death Note has times for comic relief, by the way. But it just fits. It's not over-the-top blood coming out of people's noses things (aside from one part...), it is actually quite dark in its humour as well at times. It also uses a lot of symbolism. But it's not the annoying ""Look how smart we are, we can do symbolism"" type of stuff they teach in schools. No, it actually helps the atmosphere and story. It uses a lot of religious symbolism, for example, and is amusing and not pretentious. The plot moves at a perfect pace. The first half of the anime at least. The first part of the anime is a masterpiece. The second is pretty good but... there are flaws. 
 
 The pacing is all over the place. It is just too fast. The first one let the characters get amazing character development. And I mean all of them. The second one just rushes everything. Seriously, you have no time to think anything through and is unnecessarily confusing. The character of Mello I liked, but he isn't developed much, as mentioned previously. Near was just alright. Maybe even mediocre. He is just an L rip-off. He might be more interesting in the manga but we're talking about the anime here. And he just comes off as an L rip-off here. The ending, I thought wasn't bad in theory but there were some badly executed things. That song at the end RUINED IT! Seriously, who in their right mind put a song which sounds more fitting for a Disney animated classic in such a dark and twisted story?! Now this is pretentious and stupid. It also left a lot of questions left to be answered. Too many. I'd talk about it more but I want to avoid spoilers. 
 
 Also, Misa. She is annoying. And I mean very, very annoying.  She is a bit okay at times but in the end just ruins the dark, mysterious feeling of the anime and makes all ""kawaii"" and crap. 
 
Overall, Death Note is no doubt an amazing anime. The first half is, again, a masterpiece. The second is pretty good but is not as good as the first. You just want to watch more. You can't stop. I'm still obsessed with it.

    This review contains small spoilers, but not like it will ruin your viewing experience, so I gaurantee you that. 
Well, to start, I recommend this anime when you're looking for a sitback moment, take your drink and food and watch this serie in one run. It wil definitly make your day. 
 
So now to the review. 
Story 8/10 
This is one of the most thought-about anime I've seen. The story itself is compleet. It takes a chlichée (Don't you dare to say that swapping bodies isn't clichée.) subject and making it a strong pillar to held on. The story only goes about it, but what they managed to do is fantastic with it. Starting with a not knowing what to do individual teenagers. They decide, because they have to, to group up and make their own club. They become friend, strange things happen, but they make it not like suddenly Taicho evolves into an monster or something. In the later episodes there happens something that is quite unbelievable, but believe me! It makes perfect sense. There is an explenation for it all! 
Well I'm getting of tracks. But it has a LOT of good things. But the critic I am, and I know Slice of life isn't all about realism, but purly on showing someones life. But somethings, I've to admit have bother me a little. For example, in the last episode after Inaban [SpoilerFree] and they are walking with them five talking about what hapend, the moments when that one guy [SpoilerFree] and Taicho got the full load. (All those dirty minded people are now laughing. No it's not THAT!) 
Well I found that quite unrealistic, but after thinking about it now, it makes sense and it really completed the story. 
 
Art 9/10 
No comment. Loved the style and detail to those CUTE expressions from Inaban. 
 
Sound 9/10 
Nothing bothered me. So a big 9. 
 
Character (development) 
7/10 
Horrible character development. 
Nah just kidding, it really focused on character development. And it actually is debatable if it is so good that you an compare it the Clannad. I mean, everyone has their piece of background. 
Except Taiho. And that quite confuses me the most. In the whole story they really focussed on all the other characters but rather forgot the most important piece. If they added an episode purely focused on Taicho I would've given a 10/10. But it didn't bother me that much. 
Maybe they could've put more detail in the background story with Nana, but I guess it's alright? 
 
So I enjoyed it a lot. My final result: 8/10 
Well deserved 8 and a recommended serie!

    Wasn't gonna write a review for this one. Did it anyways. ¯_(ツ)_/¯  
 
Story: 9 
Hamatora gets a 9 in my book. Maybe I'm a sucker for episodic animes with a hidden plot backbone (Akuma no Riddle was a personal favorite of mine in this category) but I really feel like Hamatora took its plot in the right direction. Some episodes seem fillerish or too forced, but then by the end you realize that the events of the episode connected back to the plot all along! The last episode left me needing more, and when I found Re:_Hamatora, I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of the second season (I could go more into that, but let's just say I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as season 1). The only real problem I have with it is the direction season 2 took, but maybe I should leave that out of my review for Hamatora? Eh, who knows. 
Art: 8 
Honestly this would get a 9 if the distance models weren't... interesting. The closeups and backgrounds were stunning, and the take on flashy colors and glitches gave a stylistic feel to it, but when it all got down to it, the distance renders were SOOOO BAD. Otherwise, good job with the art. 
Sound: 9 
Okay the first opening was mediocre at best. The visuals were great but the song was basic and didn't leave an impression, nor did it really catch my eye. Re:_Hamatora certainly had an incredible opening, but that's its only salvation. Despite the OP, I gave sound a 9 because the OST was always pretty fitting and the voice actors were always really convincing. 
Character: 6 
EEEEHHHHH.... Hamatora's characters in the first season had little depth. They really seemed like they never developed by the end of it, ESPECIALLY Hajime. She had a lot of potential as a character, but she hardly spoke in the first season and then became a ditzy love interest in the second season. Birthday and Ratio got one episode of development and backstory and then their characters weren't touched on again. Murasaki, a MAIN CHARACTER, PART OF TEAM HAMATORA, got less screen time than Art, a character who lost his relevance half way through the series, and not even half the amount of development! If you want an anime for its characters, Hamatora isn't a good choice for you. 
Enjoyment: 9 
My own personal experience with Hamatora was a good one, honestly. I really loved the story and its uniqueness, and the art was really alluring. I could go on for days about Hamatora and Re:_Hamatora's flaws, but honestly they didn't affect my enjoyment THAT much. It was a fun anime to watch in my free time and I really did like it. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an episodic anime with a plot in the back. It's kind of a low-maintenance anime which I really liked, since I watched it in the hospital on my tiny phone screen with IVs in my arms. If you're looking to pass time, go for Hamatora, but be prepared for a god-awful second season and a LOT of plotholes.

    Neon Genesis Evangelion. Primarily, its a love or a hate anime, you might like it, you might hate it. Well, things are tremendously interesting if you like it. The name of this classic masterpiece lingers on throughout the anime world as one of the best Mecha animes of all time, next to Gundam. This anime's characters all have a backstory worth paying attention to and looking at, primarily because they all have a part to play in the big scheme of things. The music is unforgettable in this Anime and would sometimes want to make you cheer while listening. Take note that this is a psychological anime too, so not all the music would be super cheery and exciting. This anime also plays on some of the dark perspectives of humanity and the inner fear and hate a human could have for himself and others. This anime is immensely great, and if you are reading this review, then start watching this show as soon as possible!

    To be honest, I could never get into this anime even as hard as I tried to get into it. The drawing style is beautiful and for that reason alone I found myself captivated. A couple episodes in, I found out it was dreadful: some of the characters were beyond annoying and I honestly had to stop myself from punching anything as I watched it. 
 
The plotline was another thing that was a turn-off,  but the biggest thing that made me aggravated was how they were all prepared to be mafiosos: no one actually had to train big time! It was as if the skill and everything came easily to them. This bothered me the most when they fought against the Varia, who all strived and fought for their talents - unlike these teenagers who merely show up and magically earn everything without even noticing it.  
 
I really cannot understand the huge fuss that occurred over this anime, nor why it is still an 8, almost a 9 - but, hey, everyone has different opinions and this was just mine.

    Wow. I don't write many reviews, but I had to for 3-gatsu no lion. It's been in my watch list for a while but I just pulled the trigger, and I'm glad I did. 
 
I don't know that I have ever seen a show (including live-action Western shows) that have dealt with depression and loneliness so well. The characters are realistic, relatable and interesting.  
 
Honestly the only thing I don't love is the art style. Not to say that it isn't good, it just isn't really ""my thing,"" but it in no way detracts from the experience as a whole. 
 
This anime is a masterpiece, and speaks to me like few things have. Do yourself a favor, and watch this show.

    I had never seen the Evangelion series before watching the movie. When I saw the movie, it was really confusing, just like everyone said it was. I really loved the animation and the sound, and the voice acting was great as well. The characters were well put, and when it ended it left me wanting more. This was a really great movie and a great way to start me off in the series.

    I thoroughly enjoyed this anime! It had outstanding art, story, sound, and characters. I look forward to a season 2 for this series. Great character development and plot. There are moments of melodrama and exaggerated emotion, but it achieves a perfect balance between weaving a cohesive and charming plot with traditional anime elements. It is one of the few anime in which I would watch again. The music was also outstanding. It reinforced many of the scenes - including the more emotional ones. There are abundant amounts of laughter and comedic scenes for everyone, as well as comic relief characters to offset the dramatic scenes. Please WATCH! It is worth the journey of 25 episodes!

    I'm glad mangakas still dare to have a different art form, and not being so absolute about the typical, cute, anime-ish style. 
 
I really appreciated the try Hirano Kouta sensei did, and I can say for sure, it was a huge success! 
 
The script was interesting, the scenes well-balanced, and there was a game-like atmosphere during the development of the story, I really enjoyed. 
 
The strategies were brilliant - rational, logical, reasonable. 
Every move had a reason for being done. 
 
The character selection was excellent. We've seen people with different nationalities, from different social groups,with different super powers, or personalities, but we don't usually see from different historical periods! 
 
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SECOND SEASON!

    Fucking sweet anime about an ex-gymnast turned street fighter and her daily life/daily fights. While it starts of in something closely resembling ""the real world"" it does get more bizarre as the series continues. Though never to a disconcerting or intrusive level. The fights in this are great looking, very flashy but still retaining a semblance of ""reality"" which makes them all the more spectacular. 
 
It also has a somewhat odd presentation in terms of story; as with most fighting anime manga the delivery of plot tends to be, by the very nature of the thing, episodic, usually delivered in a fight-train-fight format. However with Airmaster the delivery is more like a ""slice of life drama"" and it just so happens the main protagonist is involved in a lot of fighting. I think this can be seen best in the conclusion of the series, which could be seen as disappointing if one hasn’t grasped the flow of the series plot. 
 
That’s not to say I wouldn’t like to see more of this, as I’m unsure if the 27 episode anime fully covers the 28 volume manga.

    I know this is the part of the review that everyone will read and skip over the rest but seriously watch this anime! The anime was not just your typical BOOM they fall for each other and everything ends up together getting married and everything but just sit back and enjoy this amazing story! SPOILERS AHEAD 
 
Story 9/10: The story isn't your typical love story thrown in with a few comedy moments.. The story is a roller coaster of emotions which will either have you laughing your ass off or crying in the corner wishing it was you! I'd love for alot more backstory to each character but it never came but I still liked it! It was good how the paired them together showing not your typical good looking/perfect pairing that will always be together in a show and actually made them different to each other! The comedy in the show was average at best and it made me laugh some times! It was overly funny and the faces they'd put on sometimes were amazing! The one thing I disliked about the whole thing and I know it's supposed to be a rom-com but at sad/romantic moments they'd try to make everything into a comedic moment which would ruin it sometimes! The story wasn't over barely dramatic with a few exceptions every now and then but it was still enjoyable! 
 
Art 6/10: I definitely was thrown off of the anime due to the art/animation for this show and I was hesitated to watch it even when it started but I still gave it a try! The anime is pretty much awful but it still has it's time here and there and it's still a good watch! The anime is years old and I wouldn't expect it to be a work of art but I still really enjoyed it at romantic/happy moments! 
 
Sound 8/10: Nothing really stood out that much but it also never sucked! Nothing really popped out at any points to make me thing ""Wow this is a great soundtrack"" but maybe that's because I was more concentrated on the art style and what was happening! 
 
Character 8/10: Each character is unique and is seemed to stay that way the entire way through! It was really well made how they made each of the main characters developed their emotions.. It was good to see him reject her twice first before actually realizing his feelings! If it would of been ""Oh I suddenly like you now because you like me"" would of made it less amusing and would of made it kind of awkward for me to watch seeing them suddenly sprout a romance from thin air! The supporting characters seemed to have a fairly big decent part in everyone coming together and they weren't overused nor were they barely ever used.. They were used to a decent amount where it affected the story and each of them getting together. 
 
Overall: The story and characters were fairly decent and very enjoyable for a person to watch whose looking for a good story line which will have a happy ending along with a strong romance type that is not appearing out of thin air! I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys romance! I can not say this enough but LOOK PAST THE ANIMATION! TRUST ME! :D

    Wow. Lovely Complex also known as LoveCom amuses me. I mean the story is well planned. What I like the most about the animé is the characters and the story. (Sorry for the spoilers or something.) the story is all about a young girl who has this problem about her height. She is tall. She is the tallest of all the girls in her class. Or maybe in her school, while the lead boy is the shortest. So, in short, there are some kind of a mix up about their heights. But because of this, their friendship sprouted. The two of them get well along. But the two doesn't seem to notice it. Until one day the girl realized she fell in love with the boy. But the boy was too uhh, what do you call him.. weirded out. Something like that. Because of their ""height"" problem. But the girl, keeps on pushing and pushing herself to the boy until one day, the boy, too, fell in love with the girl. Happy Ending :)) Anyway, this is a good comedy-romance animé. You'd really enjoy this. If you have time, try watching this. It's unique ideas and plot is exciting. 
 
On the other hand, the art is not that good. But you'll find the characters adorable. Most especially Otani, the male protagonist (well, for me, he is cute :3) 
The sound is okay but it can't bring you into tears or whatever. It just adds this ""awww"" moment whenever the two are confessing their love with each other. 
 
This is very enjoyable. If you do not know what to watch next, then I must say to you, WATCH THIS NEXT! :))

    I LOVE BLEACH but on to the review  
bleach is a very great animation that is full of action at each corner and plus bleach also is a show for laughs as well. the show is well thought out for veiwers whose looking for something to cheer them up. the characters are made up perfectlly and and are very diffrent from what you see in your average anime. bleach does has their flaws but they can cover it up withe the excitment in each episode. 
but hey this is my opinion on bleach so please note that people are diverse....

    While not the best Miyazaki film, I still think this film was fantastic. I haven't seen Lupin III, but the plot to this was really cute and romantic (Pretty much like Castle in the Sky, but not as romantic as Howl's Moving Castle). 
 
Story: At the beginning, the story is a little sappy, but it gets better as soon as Lupin goes off to find Lady Clarisse. Their romance is adorable. I loved both Lupin and Clarisse the way they start off their personalities as Clarisse (girly) and Lupin (excitable). The plot is a little jumpy, but I don't think it was too bad. 9/10 
 
Art: Even though I don't watch anime with art that looks cartoon-like such as anime shows like Heidi, Girl of the Alps, or A Little Princess Sara, I still thought it was nicely drawn and I loved the way the characters are drawn. 8/10 
 
Sound: I was going to rate this a 9/10 for the new English Dub, but I instead rated it a 10/10. I thought the music score was fine and it is very relaxing. The new English Dub I didn't think was too bad, it really fitted the characters and their personna, so I don't mind the English Dub or the Music Score. 10/10 
 
Character: I loved the characters and how their likeness are. My favorite has got to be Lupin, he pretty much reminds me of Mickey from Mickey Mouse and thus, he's the main character of the movie. The other main characters are very funny and the supporting characters show passion and likeness. 
 
Enjoyment: While I was watching this, I didn't think it should be placed on Miyazaki's best films ever since it is old. My first Miyazaki movie had to be Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, I remember seeing that at like nine, and I used to think that it was Miyazaki's first film, but being now older, it's by population. Nausicaa had more watches than Lupin did. I have a strong sense of humor, so I giggled at a couple of parts, but I really enjoyed this movie overall. 7/10 
 
Overall: Worth-watching and funny. Try it. 8/10

    This is going to be my first review in a long time and sorry for the gramatical mistackes i make. 
So a while ago when the anime was not still out i read the first couple of chapters of the manga.I think it was 6.I liked it soo much and when i heard that a anime is being made i stopped reading in order not to spoil it later.So lets begin: 
Story 4/10 
The story starts interesting its about a boy called Akatsuki Kojou who 3 months ago became the 4th Progenitor the strongest vampire accompanied by 12 familliars.Well i expected a overpowered badass main character but it didnt turn that way.So if you are looking for a such character this is not a show for you.I'm not saying he is weak or wimpy like some other characters but whenever there is a fight that woman (the main heroine) says ,,It's not only your fight its ours"".So we never actualy see him going full power.As the story goes you will find your self more and more bored.One of the problems in the story is that after one arc finishes the second begins right away not leaving any space for the character development. 
Art 7/10 
The characters are well desinged and the battles are really well done.Thats about it. 
Sound 5/10 
The opening and the ending didnt really leave much impresion on me.I guess they were average. 
Character 4/10 
The problem with the characters is that they are intruduced quickly.I dont even remember the names of anyone of them exept the main guy.The villans were just evil for the sake of it and there wasnt much background for the characters.To put it simply they were there just for Kojou to take blood from them. 
Enjoyment 6/10 
The show wasnt entirely bad.If they made a little more efort in the plot and at least made it so that i could at least remember the character names it would have been one of the better animes i have watched. 
Overall 5,2/10 
Well if you have nothing to watch or a lot of free time i would reccomend this anime

    This is classified as horror but it was so cliched and dramatic I laughed the whole time. Only the last episode made me put down my cheeze-its for a second. The characters` motives were all way too irrational and pointless, I do understand they are traumatized- in shock and what not but it didn`t make sense. Tell me how a blind girl can walk 4 miles (give or take a few) to a beach by herself. TELL ME. There were many holes and unanswered questions throughout the anime, but hey its only 12 episodes. I would recommend it to a friend just for laughs and I finished it in 6 hours maybe less.

    Code Geass is the best anime ever.  
Its about a prince and his sister who get banished from their country by their father after their mothers death. Years pass and Lelouch is a normal teenager going to school in japan a newly conquered area for Britania but his distatse for his homeland Britania is still strong. One day he meets a woman C.C. and immortal witch who grants him the power of Geass (his geass is to control minds) with this power he becomes a leader of terrorist group the black knights and calls himself Zero. Lelouch's ultimate goal is to destroy Briatnia and make a peaceful world where his crippled sister Nunally can grow up in freely. 
The story was epic 
Art was awesome really good job by CLAMP loved the nightmares 
Sound was great no problems 
Characters were absolutly outstanding Lelouch, Kallen, C.C., Suzaku, Nunally all were amazing 
I have never enjoyed any anime as much as Code Geass 
Overall Code Geass was a 10/10 perfect

     I never thought that a fictional work could leave me this disturbed. I will start by saying that I did not enjoy watching School Days, yet I would not say it was a bad anime, and I do not regret watching it. It managed to make me angry at almost every character involved since I felt like almost every relevant character was either dumb, despicable, or both. The way it is set up however still made me feel somewhat sorry for many of them. 
 
There's some things that School Days does really, really well. It shows the development of the main character, Makoto Itou, from a pretty average, slightly perverted high school boy to someone much more despicable. This does not happen in a sudden conversion, rather it is a slow development that does not happen without reason. 
 
It also manages to show that life can be cruel, and what it can lead to if you can not accept that sometimes you just lose, even though you might have done everything right. 
 
As I mentioned in the introduction, it also is really good at making the viewer angry. Whether this is positive or negative, you decide. 
 
However, it did also have its problems. The first 4-5 episodes were rather boring, cringy, and felt dragged out too long, in my opinion they could have fit them into 2-3 eps.  I was close to dropping it after the 4th episode because nothing interesting seemed to happen (and only didn't because I had the ending spoiled for me and knew that it would have to take a different direction soon). The end of episode 5, however, marks the start of the good part of this series. 
 
The girls' love also felt exaggerated. Sure, they know him for quite some time and got to like him eariler in their lives, but after finding out about what he has done it is hard to believe that they would all still try to be his girlfriend. Love might make you blind, but not like that. At least not everyone. 
 
Would I recommend you to watch it? If you like psychological dramas then yes, absolutely, but be prepared to still hate every second of it. I was relieved when I finally watched the final episode because I did not want to be this angry, and towards the end partially sad, anymore, but it certainly was an experience that I like to have made. I feel like I can not properly rate this anime with a number, it was great yet at the same time terrible, I did not enjoy it yet I like the fact that I watched it. I'll go with a 6/10 because of the awful awful early episodes and the fact that I did not enjoy it at all, yet it left a lasting impression and I think it's a decent anime overall. Seriously though, just ignore the number and make up your mind based on the review.

    Story: This OVA is based off the game by the same name &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; basically there is a girl that is the &quot;chosen&quot; and she is to go on a mission to save her world from dying of a mana shortage. She is joined by her friends and they go on the journey for her to become an angel, which she needs to become to save the world. Now, I won't say this OVA won't be enjoyable if you haven't played the game, but you will notice that there are big gaps in time which they are supposed to be filled in in the game. And if you've played the game, you'll be disappointed only because it has sooo much potential to be a very good anime series, but it cuts short :( Assuming you haven't played the game, there'll be some plot twists, and should keep you interested. 
 
Art: If you've played the game, then you've seen the movie cut scenes that show up every now and then, and seeing as how Gainax produced those scenes, it's understandable that it was high end animation. Although Gainax doesn't produce the OVA, the quality stays. The characters are drawn well, and all the animation is smooth. 
 
Sound: I assume sound means the soundtrack and voice acting, both of which I felt were okay. I enjoyed the voice acting more than I did the music, mainly because of a very good cast. You'll recognize many of the voices, and I they fit the characters well. The soundtrack wasn't bad, but nothing memorable, personally, i got kind of bored the OP, and ED. 
 
Character: The characters never had a chance to progress, mainly because the series was so short. There was some progression, such as with Sheena and Lloyd, and change of character with someone else..., but there wasn't much gradual change. The characters are fun to watch, there are many personalities, serious, nerdy, naive, kind, etc. with all of them complementing each other. 
 
Enjoyment: Ever since I played the game a few years ago, I loved the movie cut scenes, and always said that they should make a series just from this, and now that they did, I had to watch. Although it did not nearly meet my expectations, I did enjoy it, in fact it had me wanting much much more. But as a person who has never played, I'd imagine that they would enjoy this series moderately, seeing as they'll obviously notice plot gaps, and a pseudo-ending. 
 
Overall: I give this series a 7 mainly because I thought it had an unimaginable amount of potential, but alas, this OVA series seems more like a promotional trailer for the game. And seeing as it is an OVA, it's too short, making the creators progress the story too quickly. I'd recommend anyone to watch this, and it may even make you want to play the game.

    Steins Gate 0 is a sequel to one of the best anime of all time. The original Steins Gate was a masterpiece in the art of storytelling. Unfortunately, many will undoubtedly be disappointed in this sequel, despite being decent as a whole. 
 
Story- 6/10 
 
The sequel's primary problem is the story's direction. Steins Gate 0 takes place right before the finale of the original Steins Gate.  
 
We follow Okabe around who is suffering greatly from PTSD as a result of the traumatic experiences he went through in the Alpha Worldline, followed by him killing Kurisu. He is a broken man and completely gives up trying to save Kurisu and the rest of the world from WWIII. This is where SG0 shines; Okabe is a great protagonist because of how sympathetic he is, despite his quirks. His pain is easy to understand. 
 
A couple of the episodes hit particularly hard- just as hard as the original. There are at least two episodes in particular that will leave you feeling gut-punched. Again, this is where SG0 is at it's strongest. It ties into the original series, gives you sympathetic, easy to root for characters and puts them into tough circumstances.  
 
The problem is, these punches are too few. The original had these coming nonstop after the halfway point in the series; this one has two or three moments tops throughout the series. Then, you have just awful action scenes. Characters dodge gunfire- because as we all know, if you train hard enough you can do that. On another occasion, one character brutally cuts through and kills multiple trained soldiers whilst running around in the open...and the trained military just stand there and watch. The original Steins Gate did not have non-sensical action scenes, and thank god for that. It didn't have nearly the amount of bullcrap that the ones in this series had. It also didn't have the fan service this one had; some characters have larger chests, two ""you saw me nude"" scenes, and there is a cringe-worthy breast mashing scene. Ugh. 
 
The other thing I'll mention which works to it's detriment are needless characters. The added characters were not necessary to the story. If anything, they made the plot feel looser and all over the place at times. I'll go into more detail on this in the character section. 
 
What the story should have been about was Okabe goes through a depressive period in his life following Kurisu's death. Eventually, WWIII starts as a result of Nakabachi/Kurisu's time travel thesis. Okabe witnesses the carnage of WWIII first hand and the death of his friends, which motivates him to send a d-mail to the past once more and build a time machine. The end. It would have made for a much tighter plot and (hopefully) cut down on the poorly executed action scenes.  
 
Art- 7/10 
 
The art is usually quite good. Even the rare CGI used on Amadeus isn't bad at all. Characters are designed nicely, and they particularly did a good job designing a broken Okabe. Not many complaints here, other than a few wonky scenes (such as first few OPs with Kurisu) and a lazy action scene (but that's more to the detriment of the story than the art).  
 
Sound- 8/10 
 
The OST is good. They use some from the original series as well as from the Visual Novel. It doesn't have nearly the same impact as the original series did, and there were a couple times when it even felt somewhat out of place. But the OP, ending, and most of the OST are very good. The dub is also good. 
 
Character- 8/10 
 
I gave the original series a 10/10 here. Every character in the original served a purpose to the story without feeling contrived. They all had sympathetic circumstances and were easy to root for as well. The biggest problem with SG0 is the new characters were simply not necessary. 
 
Kagari is just pointless. She has memory problems at the start of the series and is involved in many of the terribly executed action scenes later on. But why? Why have this character in the story? She adds nothing to the plot. 
 
Amadeus is another. Why do we need an AI version of Kurisu? Nakabachi/Kurisu's thesis should have been enough to create time machines. Why erase that plot point from the original series? ""Memories"" shouldn't have been necessary. 
 
And finally Maho. She is sympathetic in her own right, having to deal with her envy of Kurisu and a bit of a rivalry with her, despite also being good friends. But why did we need another young, genius female scientist? To create a time machine? Daru and Okabe can already do that. Hell, they did it without scientist help the Alpha worldline (although it wasn't great). She simply wasn't necessary for the plot.  
 
I'll tell you why these characters were added: Kurisu. Kurisu is dead in this sequel. So they wanted to find a bunch of ways to put her throughout the entire series while *trying* to make sense. Kagari looks exactly like Kurisu, but has Mayuri's breasts and personality; Amadeus is literally kurisu's memories and appearance, but has no physical body; Maho is a loli version of Kurisu. 
 
Adding Yuki (Suzuha's mom) is fine. I think getting to see the pressure Daru has of becoming lovers with her adds to his sympathetic character traits. Suzuha as well, who was still broken up about her mom being killed in her timeline. They could have just as easily added Suzuha's mom to the original series, but they didn't (though she has a cameo in the special episode). Know why? Because she wouldn't have added anything to the plot. So she wasn't put in. That is good storytelling. 
 
As for some of the other original cast, Ruka is alright. Faris gets a bit sillier unfortunately and isn't as sympathetic as she was in the original. Daru is a bit mixed; as mentioned earlier, I sympathize with his love and daughter struggles, but his perverted jokes were also more cringey this time. In the original, he never went over the top with that; he had just enough to feel like one of your friends from college. 
 
Of course, this might seem like a harsh critique on the characters. I like Maho and Amadeus at least, they're just used to the detriment of the story. Okabe is a fantastic protagonist, one of the best in anime you'll ever find. Mayuri's struggle with her own form of regret makes her a stronger character this time around. And although Kurisu's appearance in this sequel was short, she is still an amazing woman that leaves a strong impression.  
 
Enjoyment- 7/10 
 
Overall I liked Steins Gate 0. It throws significantly fewer punches than the original series but they hit just as hard. Okabe's journey is quite a memorable one. Unfortunately, I was also left quite disappointed in the loose plot, sloppy action scenes and needless character additions. Many will consider this title inferior to it's predecessor, and rightfully so. Yet, Steins Gate 0 is still decent enough in it's own right, and deserves a watch from any fan of the original. 
 
Overall- 7/10 
 
Pros: 
+ Gut-punching scenes involving sympathetic characters 
+ Solid OST and animation 
+ Fantastic protagonist 
+ Good dub 
 
Cons: 
- Awful action scenes 
- Needless character additions 
- Loose plot

    If you're a looking at a review for the second season, chances are you've already seen the first and wondering if you should bother with the second. The answer is yes. Pretty much the same crew is back to produce the second season of KonoSuba. As a result, it picks up right where you'd expect, and feels virtually the same as the first season. 
 
The only real downside is the lack of any substantial character development. everyone has their shtick or quirk that offers comedic value, and they don't really change because of it. If you wanted to think about it way too hard, you could try to defend it as a statement on how little people tend to actually change over time. That really isn’t the case here, though, and this is fantasy; I’d rather see some actual character development than face the crushing reality of human nature.

    This series simply doesn't get the credit that it should, instead DBZ seems to get majority of the praise. I enjoyed both series and have watched them a ridiculous amount of times, but Dragonball has something that DBZ didn't, I don't know what that something is, but it's what makes Dragon ball the better series.  
 
-Comedy (Not much of this carried over to DBZ) 
-The series based around the tournaments 
-Jackie Chun 
 
Three things that made DB great; don't get me wrong, I would still rate DBZ perfect as well, I just don't think it's as clever as Dragonball.

    It's bad anime. It is below averange level for grown-up people. 
I didin't read the manga, I don't know how's with it, but this anime is bad. If you haven't watched it, you can of course but I tell you - go with some other series with high rating. You won't waste a day of your life this way. 
 
Why? 
 
I don't know what do people that claims it to be 10/10 see in it, maybe it's because they loved the manga or they watched it in school and feel a sentiment. 
Well I didn't read it and I'm not in schoolage, and here's how it looks for me: 
 
Good things: 
Good thing in it for me at least is medieval setting, knights, kings, castles and all - wich can be in some degree enjoyable. 
 
Now bad things: 
It's not so easy to stand the old-fashioned art and poor animation it has but it's somehow understandable as this series has its years (although it's not SO old). Anyway it could be not a flaw if the plot and the feeling were good. (or awesome like in Cowboy Beebop) 
 
But the story is infantile. The unvincible hero with posture of a bodybuilder, silly and kind of funny combat scenes, flat dialogues, not much of depth - what's this? He-man? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? I bet I would be enjoing this like hell... if I was 10 years old. I would write in this review it's kind of cartoon for kids and if you're a teenager go ahead and watch it but what with all this bloody violence and the final rape scene? Then for who this anime is except Berserk manga fans? It's just poor. 
 
I could count many examples of its silliness but take this one. What's with this name of the main character - Guts? Give me a break. With his posture and overall macho image in anime it would've been good if this series were mentioned to be humorous. But it attempts to be serious. And he's running, swinging his big sword, defeating countless groups of enemies by himself. Again - stuff for kids. If there were some humorous thing about it, some wink or just another interesting things in this anime it could've been different. But there's no such thing! 
 
Opening theme is silly for my taste so my personal sound raiting goes down a little too. 
 
 
In summary it can be a little entertaining but it absolutely can't be compared to other high rated anime like Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Beebop, Genshiken or whatsoever, you get the point. It doesn't deserve even 8/10 and it's for sure no masterpiece.

    A ranking system, based on grades. The top 7 get treated elegantly and specially, now who would want that? Well, I do, because that would motivate me to actually study. 
 
Story: 7/10 
 
Special A is the type of anime that doesn't have a lot of story. It starts off really slow, but picks up its pace and goes full speed at the end. I know some people are thinking, ""Wow, that sounds boring"" but you're half right, half wrong. The main aspect that I liked about this anime is the romance side. It's very sweet and light hearted, and a lot of relationships build up in this anime. The comedy was mediocre, as there weren't a lot of jokes. The funniest part I would say about this anime is Megumi's facial expressions and what she says on her sketchbooks.  
 
Art: 6/10 
 
The art was somewhat decent and the first time I saw the anime, I thought that this anime was produced around 2006-7. The colors in the anime are actually nice, and the animation was somewhat ok.  
 
Sound: 7/10 
 
Since it's a 24 episode anime, there's bound to be at least 2/3 OP and ED. In my opinion, I liked the 2nd OP the most. No idea why, but I thought it fit the anime nicely. To me, the first OP sounded like it was sung by someone who just woke up and had no desire to sing. The first ED was above average, as it fits the role of being the ED. 
 
Character: 9/10 
 
Each character in the anime is very unique and fit their own roles. 
 
Kei Takashima, the most talented man in the anime owns the Takishima Group. He's very wealthy, athletic and good looking. He's also very hard-working, kind and always thinks mostly of Hikari and sometimes the other SA members about their safety. 1st in SA. 
 
Hikari Hanazono, the average girl and the only one who isn't rich in the SA group. Hard-working and always wants to see everyone smile and not be sad. Though, I hate the type of people who would pry into everyone's issues. Very athletic and smart. 2nd in SA. 
 
Jun Yamamoto, a very quiet and anti-social person. He does not like to be with any girls except for his twin sister. 3rd in SA. 
 
Megumi Yamamoto, a girl who barely talks in the anime and uses a sketchbook to communicate with others. In my opinion, my favorite character in the anime. She has funny facial expressions and what she writes on her sketchbooks can sometimes be funny too. 4th in SA. 
 
Tadashi Karino, the idiot of the anime. Of course, when the character is voiced by Shimono Hiro, you automatically think the character is a massive idiot. He likes to eat food and is very dense romantically. Though, he can be helpful sometimes. 5th in SA. 
 
Akira Toudou, the cook in SA and likes to hit Tadashi whenever he does something that annoys Akira or goes with other girls. Of course, she's a tsundere. She's obsessed with Hikari, a lot. 6th in SA. 
 
Ryu Tsuji, the animal-loving freak in the anime. Though, he can be very calm and he is basically a father-figure to Megumi and Jun. He cooks for them, cares for them and does anything a father can do for their child. He also has a fighting nature, but in a violent way. 7th in SA. 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
 
Even though I put the anime on hold for nearly half a year, after coming back to it, I actually enjoyed it. The comedy and romance, they both fit together in the anime. I would find myself skipping to parts of the episode if it gets too boring. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
 
A light-hearted, somewhat funny anime. Hikari and Kei resemble both Usui and Misaki in the anime Kaichou-wa Maid-sama! in my opinion.  Would I re-watch this anime? Maybe not.

    I have never given a review out of all anime's I have watched in my life, but Cop craft resonated powerfully with me as a African American and that is due to the character of Tilarna Exedilica. The animation at times is choppy and the episode endings cliche, but that didn't stop me from getting a lot of enjoyment out of the series and I wish for a second season. Kei Matoba resonates powerfully with my in regards to my friends, being African American I have had many friend's families tell their kids they shouldn't associate with me because of my skin color, my race, but kei represents what a lot of my friends did for me growing up, they went against their own raising, families and their community to remain friends with me. Some have even put their lives on the line for me.

    From the starting episodes Re:Creators looked like a contender for anime of the year with its amazing visuals, intriguing plot and nice music. But somewhere halfway the tension dropped and it became much longer than it had to be.  
 
Though i do admit the episodes were intended to develop the characters but it should not come at the cost of quality.  
 
To its credit it picked up the slack towards the end and gave me quite a rush and showed me its 'anime of the year' material which left me satisfied. 
 
Although its quality only shined in the earlier and latter parts of the anime i still recommend you watch it.

    I without a doubt believe that Violet Garden & Sora yori mo Tooi Basho are the best shows of the winter season. Both being emotionally compelling and amazingly done.  
 
Violet Garden is a special gem. It is able to keep your attention all through out the show.  Sure we get a couple episodes here or there that seem to not have the overall quality of other episodes. But they still tend to keep me hooked.  
 
The relationship between Violet and the Major is nice and the show manages to make it not seem forced. I never once thought that the relationship between the two is boring or felt like they were showing us to much or two little.  
 
I at time thought it got a bit frustrating that they use the same clips of Violet and the Major a decent amount.   
 
But they did get me to not only care about the relationship between them, But they also got me to care about a character that is only ever seen by flashbacks. 
 
Some of the episodes like previously mentioned, I don't feel that they hit the mark they were trying to achieve. Sometimes i feel that the reason why something is sad is forced and the only reason we feel sad is because they want us to and not because something is actually sad. Sometimes stories were just depressing and that's not enjoyable.  
 
I'm talking about episodes like the Observatory, Where it's mostly just some dude fawning over Violet and nothing of interest really happens. Sure this episode has some nice art. But it's nothing special compared to other episodes with some having even better art.  
 
Then there are episodes like the Writer that is in need of help writing his Play. The story arc with his Daughter having some weird disease seems forced and implemented badly imo. At the end of the episode i just ended it feeling more depressed then anything. Being depressed isn't something stories should try and achieve. 
 
You know how that could've been implemented better ? Instead of having it be an alcoholic trying to write his daughters bedtime story into a play, Have it be about the Daughter having to come to terms with her dad at deaths door and her taking on the role of her dad. Have her try to write the play that she'd always talk about with her dad. Violet would come in and help the girl deal with her father soon passing and also the play. Ending of the story would be about the girl taking on her fathers role of a famous Book/Play writer.  
 
By far my favorite story would be Episode 10. In this episode Violet comes across a Sick mother and a little girl that looks to be around 6 or even 5. Just the entire way the story is portrayed and the relationship both the Daughter and Violet make together over that brief time is awesome. Even better is that i didn't at once think the little girl was annoying. Me being in the group of people that feel that Little kids ruin games/Media, This was honestly surprising to me.  
 
I honest to god think that this would have been an amazing episode to end the season on. I think the show should've had this as the 13 episode instead of what we got.  
 
Have this be the ending or have Violet come back at the end of the 13 episode with the previously mentioned mother passing away due to her sickness. Violet would make the conscious decision to stay with the daughter. With Violet being someone that the girl both knows and adores it would also make sense.  
 
The idea of Violet growing as a person would shine the brightest with her taking on the role of the mother girl the 5 year old girl that had her mother died. Violet knowing about the effects of dealing with the death of loved ones would also help the girl get over her death. I like this idea more then what we got. 
 
I don't like that it showed the girl growing up through the years and receiving the mothers letters with the story from the show . I feel that it may have even added to the story that we not find out what was in those letters so that the story about a 5 year old girl having to deal with the death of her last parent would be even more strong. I also just don't like that we ended up seeing her grow up. It takes away from us thinking about what the future will hold for her. 
 
Something else i feel this story deserves credit for is that Violet has no real love interest. Sure there was the Major but you can easily argue that he was more like a father figure then a partner. When i saw the guy working at the Doll business i thought he would be the the love interest but thankfully not. The story decides to focus on the emotional and story side rather then just randomly pair Violet up with some random guy.  
 
Last thing i'll mention. It may be me but i'd love to see Violet's backstory. We know that she was an orphan originally. Violet may even know what her life was like before becoming an Orphan and remembers her family. She never mentions her previous life and gives no clue to anyone. I'd love to see a mother reacting to finding out that her daughter that she thought died years ago is actually still alive. We would even be able  to see how Violet deals with family and the emotions of remembering her old life. I just think it would've been a nice idea.  
 
Overall i find this to be an amazing show with amazing art and characters.

    First of all I was very sceptic about this show, before I watched it. 
I thought is was only a show for girls and crazy otakus,but I was wrong. 
 
Experience: 
Lucky Star is a slice of life and comedy anime ,which also contains japanese and otaku culture . 
 
This show has much and fast Dialog’s 
I can read fast but some scenes were evenn too fast for me ,so this show is nothing for Anime beginners who need subtitles. 
 
I watched all episodes of Lucky Star in four days. 
We follow the main character Konata and her three friends Kagami,Tsukasa and Miyuki in her daily life. 
Most of the time we see them in school,or when they study at home. 
The characters are acting realistic and the friendship beetween them is authentic. 
 
The scenes in the breaks at school are a little bit boring sometimes. 
The best scenes are these,when we see the girls in their freetime. 
Konata’s shopping experiences are always funny. 
We follow the girls to the beach,to some cultural festivals and to the comiket. 
 
After the story part we see Lucky Channel with the Navigator Akari chan and her assistant Minoru Shiraishi. 
In this part they should show us some infos about the show and the characters,but everytime Akari messed it up with her bad behavior. 
She’s a mean and spoiled brat who tortures her assisant every time. 
If assistant Minoru Shiraishi says the wrong things Akira gets angry at him. 
 
The endings of the show are always different. 
In the first half of this show,we see the door of an Karaoke room where the girls talking and singing  popular Anime or japanese Songs. 
The Best part for me was in epiode 5. 
In the second half the voice actor of Akari-chan’s assistant sings the ending songs,more wrong than right, but its funny,best part of that was in episode 14, I laughed so hard. 
 
Conclusion: 
Well, in ths show it doesn’t happen a lot,we follow the girls through 2 years of their life. 
They are talking much about these and that. 
The Topics are mainly school, studying,anime, games,otaku and japanese culture. 
 
The comedy plays big part in Lucky Star ,itcontains slapstic and sometimes even some kind of adult humor. 
 
Lucky star uses much references to other anime shows. 
You should at least have watched The Melancholy of Suzumia Haruhi and Full Metal Panic to get most of the jokes. 
 
The opening theme is great, its fast and very energetic. 
 
The animation is simple but nice to watch. 
We have always the same perspectives ,so we dont see the legs of the girls very often. 
When you see the girls without legs they seem very small in height. 
 
Cons: 
No character development 
Nothing special happens 
You need a lot of otaku knowledge to understand all the jokes 
 
Pros: 
Characters 
Lucky Channel 
Opening 
Cute girls 
Comedy

    I am someone who has played the source material, the otome visual novel, first. I thought that it was absolutely amazing which is why I had very high expectations going into the anime. However, the low rating and episode count on MAL concerned me, since I knew a majority of otome visual novel adaptations fail to be good due to the studio trying to condense 40+ hours of gameplay into a short episode count. Amnesia, sadly, did this mistake.  
 
Story:  
The story sounds quite interesting at first, being an anime about a woman regaining her memories and uncovering the mysteries of her circumstances. The genres also intrigued me, being josei, mystery, romance, and fantasy. Sadly, it seems the anime didn't know what to do with its plot. It initially wants to be a tale of uncovering the heroine's memories (yes she has no name) but she doesn't really uncover ANYTHING...? She occasionally gets a fragment but most of the time it doesn't do anything to progress the plot. Another thing is that alternate worlds exist in the anime, with the heroine being a certain character's girlfriend in each different world, but unlike in the visual novel, it's never explains the importance of these worlds (I will not spoil the reason they are important since it's actually very important in the game and I'm trying to keep this spoiler free). Furthermore, it seemed the anime wanted to push the ""romance"" aspect as its main focus but it ultimately fails in this. This is because when the heroine supposedly ""falls in love"" with a character in one world and gets transferred to another world and then ""falls in love"" with someone else the love never seems genuine, especially since she seems to remember events that happened in previous worlds (which does not happen in the game). The pacing is also absolutely terrible and the story is just confusing because it doesn't know what it wants to focus on. 
 
Characters: 
Compared to the game, the characters were just... bland in the anime. In the visual novel, since there are multiple endings and routes, each character's pasts and personality traits are further explained and have more depth. However, in the anime, all the characters fall into typical tropes and have nothing special to them whatsoever other than their character designs. Toma is your typical nice and caring type. Shin is just a tsundere, Kent is a calculating and glasses wearing ikemen, and Ikki is a playboy. Ukyo, another bachelor for the heroine, was just a train wreck. He is supposedly the ""cannon"" interest and acts as an antagonist for the duration of the anime but his motives are never clearly explored. Ukyo is seen to have two personalities but the anime never explains why, which, again, is explained in the visual novel. Many of the plot holes involving the characters or the story are always explained in the visual novel, but as an anime, it shouldn't have to make the viewers confused and need to play the game just to find answers. Adding on, all of the love interests have only like 1-2 episodes dedicated to them, which gives me no attachment to them and know absolutely nothing about their characters to make me love them. Don't even get me started on the Amnesia heroine, she is a legit doormat and is there for the sake of self-insert. Heck, she doesn't even have a cannon name. Characters in the anime always refer to her as ""you"" which is pretty awkward. The heroine in the anime just lets the guys do whatever they want to her and her only lines of dialogue are lines such as ""um"" or ""ah."" In the visual novel the heroine has some defining traits to her depending on the dimension she is in which makes her more interesting, an example being when she has a love for music in the heart world and is a great singer. Did I forget anyone in this anime? OH WAIT! The side characters! Completely forgettable. Sawa, Rika, Waka,Mine, and Orion only appear very few times and when I ask people if they remember any other character other than the main ones in the anime most of the time no one remembers them. Orion is supposed to guide the heroine and help her regain her memories but a lot of the times he doesn't even show up in the anime. He keeps disappearing, for again, another reason that is never explained (and it doesn't even happen in the game). 
 
Art:  
The art was one of the only redeeming aspects of this anime. I am not an animation specialist so I cannot nitpick anything too major, but in just the eyes of an average watcher, I found the animation to be pleasing. Brain's Base did a wonderful job with the backgrounds and interpretation of Hanamura Mei's art style and I found the eye candy to be great. It was in no means perfect, but I still loved the animation. 
 
Sound:  
Amnesia's opening theme was outstandingly good! I found the music to be catchy, and when I first watched it I was excited for the contents of the anime (to my later disappointment). Ending was also pretty good and was fitting for the ending of an episode but not quite as memorable as the opening. The background music and other soundtrack weren't quite as memorable but was pleasing to hear. Overall, sound was pretty great. 
 
My ending thoughts? If you want to see some handsome bishounen then go ahead and watch, I won't judge. But if you want a riveting story then pass this anime and just play the visual novel. I said this a lot, but compared to the anime the visual novel is just better, character and story wise. This anime adaptation was an absolute mess, and I just hope for better otome game anime in the future.

I started watching this show fully intending to resume it the next day. I ended up sitting through all thirteen episodes until it was five in the morning and I was crying my eyes out. 
 
The characters, while driven by relatable, easy to understand motives really bring this show together. Even the side characters contribute to how the plot moves along. Every piece of dialogue and every emotion seems to have its place cemented inside the characters themselves. Never have I felt more conflicted about the ""antagonist"" within the show. Setsuna steals Haruki in a believable and human way. That is the key to White Album 2, everyone is an actual person and if you dig down far enough you can really enrapture yourself in what each person is after. 
 
The shot for shot mirroring from beginning, middle and end reflecting the lyrics within Love Beyond Reach really demonstrates the small things that envelope the viewer inside this wonderfully confusing world. Just when you think you've figured things out, it becomes a little more complicated. To top it off, it's portrayed in such a way that you're only discovering information as the characters do. Sure, you can easily see that Kazusa has feelings for Haruki during the beginning, but you never know the full extent of it until he does. And it's too late. White Album 2 holds your hand on a journy of discovery, one that leads through the snowy forest that melts your heart away as soon as you let it. 
 
Highly recommend this show to anyone wishing to spend some time remembering what it's like to be alive. It's an emotional roller coaster that I never wanted to step off of until the very end.

    Another is a wonderful series but not for mystery or horror as it claims itself to be, the amount of detective work required was minimal, just keep asking until someone finally talked, and the horror was too slowly paced to truly terrify you.  Instead what Another did, and did it quite well, was build up suspense and dread and that is what will cause you to become unsettled and unnerved but also keep you wanting to watch more.  Don't expect this anime to carry itself on jump scares or other cheap thrills to make you scream because your going to know what's going to happen one minute, five minutes or even an episode or two ahead of it happening, where the beauty of this anime lies is in that very build up.  There will always be a shift in the environment, and I don't mean like in some great signal by god forecasting something bad is about to happen, but a character will act a little strange or something will come to your attention when it never seemed important before.  From here the greatest amount of suspense builds because even if you saw this coming from a mile away now you know it's happening as the world focuses on this one point.  Then you cross the point of no return, and I don't mean they're dead, this anime isn't that merciful, instead you get to see the last few moments containing the reaction of the victim and any witnesses and finally their execution by the plot, and while this isn't a slasher flick there is plenty of gore when the time comes.  
 
To speak on the individual elements of Another I'll start with the audio effects and soundtrack which was pretty spot on especially with recognizing that the lack of sound is just as important as it's need at times.  When the mood needed to be elevated and you need to be put on edge the soundtrack was there.  On the flip side of the coin it was lacking at times when it came to settling you back in the safety of the normal world and you need that dichotomy in order to keep the story from becoming too heavy all the time or you take the edge off the truly terrible moments that, honestly, are the drawing force to any horror or suspense series. The only thing that I would put down as a bad point of the soundtrack though is the opening theme, normally I would just ignore a single anomaly like this but it doesn't fit very well with the series and as a stand alone it's something completely skip able.   
 
The art and animation, while wasn't something of Miyazaki's or Amano's level, yes I'm spoiled, did a great job of portraying the emotion and level of anxiety of people most of the time and kudos specifically for going through the effort of using the brows and mouth as much as the eyes in the facial expressions.  Sometimes details like that get overlooked and the immersion suffers for it.   
 
With the characters there is an interesting complex between the overall story and the environment the story takes place in, this should be a suspenseful environment but since this is in a high school setting some elements of the slice of life genre do seep in making a slice of death story if you will.  In a way it does give a nice break from all the bad stuff happening but at times it also derails you a little, luckily the violence solves that problem spectacularly.  The character immersion for the male and female lead was great but for some of the support characters it was unfortunately light, and for some of the victims they got enough screen time to just introduce the character and then they're gone which is unfortunate because that would have led to some great story elements. 
 
As for the story itself it was one of those classic camp fire stories you get during summer camp provided that your camp counselor was Clive Barker, it was dark, rich and unsettling.  This story will both draw you in and beat you up emotionally, you will feel fear, dread, hate, hope and even laugh a little.  The elements of the story are well told and form a nice cohesive plot line and the only time that it suffers is from elements that I've already mentioned.  Do expect a heavy use of cliff hangers so if you can, try to watch several episodes in a row because you'll really want to.  This is something that I would recommend you go and see, while it isn't a classic for the ages, it is definitely something to sate your apatite for the morbid and a wonderful story all around.

    For an amazing anime it had way too many flaws. I loved the characters, the story behind them and the emotions conveyed throughout the entirety of the anime. But to be honest with you there was a lot of wrong with this anime, such as how a lot of the things introduced in this anime made no sense and it was clear that the writers didn't want it to. 
 
Makoto's story arc has to be the one I love the most. She was a great character to begin with and just like Kaori she actually felt like a normal girl, but that slowly changed for better and for worse. We also had involvement of a character named Amano where her role was to help guide Yuuichi on how to deal with the problem that was facing Makoto and Yuuichi, as she had experienced this 'miracle' before. 
 
After Yuuichi had learnt the truth, Makoto became more and more child-like, in the sense of an innocent child. She lost the ability to use her hands properly and slowly lost her ability to speak; she could only say ""Auu~"" after that. Because of this Yuuichi had to spend more time with her making her happy and showing her that he'll never leave again. During those moments, the events that followed and the music that was playing worked so well together making us adore her even more. As the viewer, we already know she is going to die so having these scenes only make the departure more depressing. Not only that but twice has the Makoto survived a fever and a sleep which brings us a sense of hope, false hope. 
 
Even though I cried because of this arc, the other arcs didn't do much to me. It was all because this arc had me invested and actually made sense. Ignoring the fact that she is one of the children who are Youko, this felt very realistic. 
 
I will not go over any of the major flaws, mostly because this will end up being a rant but partly because I forgot most of them as I've seen it done too much in other anime. 
 
For a modernised '90s artwork, it looks amazing. I watched a few minutes of the '02 version of the anime and found that it was quite hard to watch, and the girls looked a lot more human in this version. Might I add Yuuichi had a complete redraw while the girls were simply updated. The backgrounds were beautiful but wasn't anything special. As I mentioned above, the background music is always working well with what is appearing on-screen and it was able to easily bring more emotion out of me as well as sounding pretty good. Also the OP and ED suited this anime very well, it showed that it was a generic love story with no real goal. 
 
Overall, I loved the show and most of the characters as well as being interested in them, but the complexity of this anime can only go so far, however being the analytical person I am (even if I don't type them down) the flaws ruin it for me.

       I'm gonna start by saying that I'm gay, but I watched this hentai because I was literally just curious about the plot. And what a great hentai this actually was! The only thing that I got off to was the main character, Hajime (Yet you don't actually completely see his naked body until halfway through episode 2, and for a high school sophomore... this sexy guy is ripped!). 
 
   This anime started off as an eroge visual novel in japan. Then, it was made into an anime. The soundtrack is great. The artwork is great. My favorite song is from episode 1 when Hajime rapes Asa in the locker room. This is the sweetest moment in the anime. Both Hajime and Asa have reached a point in their relationship to where they don't even need to ask for consent anymore. Rape does not exist anymore, this is the kind of relationship that I want in my life. This rape scene is so sweet and cute as Asa is screaming and squirting from all directions in every hole in her body. Getting pounded by Hajime as his big loads are sprayed all over the place like freshly whipped clotted cream. The song that plays in this scene is perfect. I even wrote it down, it's the kind of song that I want playing in the background when I lose my virginity. 
    
   The first episode starts off with a beautiful, sweet, and meaningful sex scene in the school's locker room next to the pool. Hajime is laying down on the ground while Asa is riding his smooth, sexy, tall, sweet, thick, juicy, hot and throbbing cock. The moans that she squeaks out are just enough to get me excited as Hajime sits up and starts to fuck her even more as he stares into your eyes. His sweet and luxurious eyes. With his sexy school clothes on. Throughout the entire anime, Hajime has sex with his clothes on, but in episode 2, there is a bath scene where he is completely naked.  
 
   It turns out that there is another girl that he has been fucking as well, Sora. She kind of looks like Nanako Dojima from, Persona 4 only a lot taller. Sora and Asa both love Hajime equally. Yet both of them are leaving in the summer. So... they both become Hajime's cumdumpsters. Constantly having sex anywhere and everywhere. Unprotected, yet no pregnancy or STD's. 
 
   Trust me, the ending will have you crying and shooting every load out of you as your cries and screams of joy are heard by your parents. The ending will have you throbbing and gasping at the mouth as you beg for more like a little bitch, Hajime's bitch. The last words spoken by the main heroin will make. You. Cry. It has the best ending that I have ever seen. Better than Persona 4 Golden, Madoka Magika, Final Fantasy X, Sonic Adventure, Tales of Symphonia, Xenoblade Chronicles, .hack//, Danganronpa, ANY OF THESE ENDINGS ARE ABSOLUTE FUCKING GARBAGE COMPARED TO THE ABSOLUTE FUCKING PERFECTION OF SORA NO IRO, MIZU NO IRO!!!!!!  
 
   YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS ANIME, IT IS THE MOST ROMANTIC, SWEETEST, MYSTERIOUS, SEXIEST, SCARIEST, SMARTEST, AND MOST PERVERTED THING EVER!  
 
   Hajime is way too sexy for his age though...

    So I pretty much promised myself, that I will write atleast 3 reviews per anime season. It will propably be hard considering how lazy can I get, but I hope I can manage it. 
 
This season I'm starting with Gamers!, because that's the anime I was propably most disappointed with. What started as a good comedy, turned out to be a show with terrible romance setup and decision making. 
 
Story 2/10 
First, let me say, there is not really much of a story in Gamers!. ""But that's normal in comedies, so what's so bad?"" you might ask. And the answer is, I dont have a problem with the actuall story. Yes, it's generic. Once again we have a school club, like we've already seen  million times before. The only thing that stoods out it that the club is about gaming. That counts only in the first 2 episodes tho, and after that you'll never hear about that gaming club again. However, the thing that was irritating me throughout the whole show was the love polygon that they've made. They based off that polygon on a couple of missunderstandings like ""wrong character is in a wrong place at a wrong time"" or ""a character seems something susspicious and makes a huge case of it, even if it was just a small thing"" and that was it. There was nothing more to it. And because of that, the whole anime is about five friends in a weird pentagon, where everyone is suspecing their lovers from cheating. Even thought it never happened and they could've explained it to themselves in a matter of minutes if they sat down and talked about it... Sadly they don't and so they take about 8 episodes in total to actually figure out that these cheating accusations are wrong, which is far from enjoyable. Oh and like I said, this anime has nothing to do with gaming. Few of the characters are playing a mobile game and they go to the arcade sometimes, and that's about it when it comes to games. 
 
BTW it maybe seems like I'm that type a guy who just thinks about everything too much and can't ""turn off"" his head while watching comedies, but this whole setup was just so lame I couldn't ignore it, even if I removed my brain completely 
 
Characters 3/10 
When you're making a comedy, likeable characters is an absolute necessity to have. Sadly enough, that didn't happen here and I can say that 3(sometimes 4) out of those 5 characters are worth of punching every single episode. The last one, Hoshinomori, is nice, but she doesn't stand out over normal comedy characters. The others are completely dumb and nobody uses their brain. Well, to be honest, even Hoshinomori doesn't use it, but atleast she's cute and not as annoying compared to others. Amano is your typical main guy with zero confidence, which is maybe popular in modern anime, but I personally hate it to the core. Karen is your typical girl that is a weeaboo even thought you would never guess is a weeaboo, which happens a lot in modern anime aswell. Tasuku and his chick are also generic, a ""cool"" guy and a ""cute"" girl, that both turn out to be very annoying in the end.  
Overall, the characters are a big problem in this one, atleast for me. If you like to watch a group of generic and dumb idiots, this anime is propably for you. 
 
Art 7/10 
I did find the art to be very likeable. I like the stylization of the characters with the exception of Tasuku, because I absolutelly hate when boys have earrings. Otherwise the art was nice, but they could have paid more attention to details or not as important scenes (the scene parodying CS:GO was the worst looking thing I've seen in a while) 
 
Sound 3/10 
Can't even remember if there was any music in this anime, which is a failure in my eyes. Opening not bad. 
 
Enjoyment 7/10 
And here we come to the point when I can atleast recommend Gamers! in some aspect. It still is a good comedy. Despite the terrible setup, despite the annoying characters, the comedy is still in there and you will laugh. The gigs are good, the anime can make a fun of itself and the same counts for the characters. It's not the best comedy-wise out there, but is definetly a good one as the jokes are keeping the anime from ""waste of time"" territorium. 
 
Overall 5/10 
Was a good comedy throughout it's way. Sadly enough, the comedy is hidden between the bad written parts of the anime and you'll need some solid nerves to actually find it. But if you do, you'll realise that this anime was not a complete waste of time.

    Right after the boom of Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu came out to satiate everyone’s need for more. I must say it exceeded my expectations. As we know, it’s a difficult process to create a sports anime that is fun for the audience even on the actual matches, which most of the times, if not handled carefully, can make the story a lot dull. 
 
Story, as said, was a great work of balance. The games’ clever strategies and excess of movement is something i hadn’t seen in a while. Something to add is that they’re all real, no game move was created out of nowhere, only actual volleyball players’ strategies or an adaptation of them. The matches are also variable, i don’t think there was any speciality repeated on each adversary the main team had to play with (besides on purpose). Always keeping up with new changes, my enjoyment was bigger as it progressed. 
Surprised me when i noticed that there was gonna be no romance or personal dramas at all, in a bad and good way. I’m a fan of mixed genres, specially on the relationships area, but Haikyuu managed to be way better without it. The focus on only volleyball was a great way to envolve the friendship and rivalries between the players.  
 
Art. Definitely one of the best i’ve seen in a sports anime! The thin lines and drawing style characteristic of Production IG was the perfect match for all the rush and movement of the characters. And actually also nicely used to complement the strategies visuals. 
 
Sounds. Both openings’ and endings’ vocals and melodies were outstanding. None of them failed me, visuals and songs being related to give us the best experience possible.  
 
Characters. All of them were technically and emotionally developed as matches progressed, both individually and as a team. Specially the friendship between the main two, who had their own obstacles with each other, was growing with every game and teamwork. 
 
Overall and Enjoyment are definitely a 10 for me. My only problem was the slow progression of the relationship between Hinata and Kageyama. I’d have enjoyed it way more if they didn’t insist on making them rivals for more than 10 episodes.

    When I first picked up this anime, the first 5 minutes had me questioning the entire thing, and to be honest I questioned watching the entire thing, but as the anime progressed I started to like it more and more. To call it a romance is a bit of a stretch but that does not stop me from recommending it to other people, Its cute, funny, and has that little bit of cringe that we all like. Its not focused on the drama aspect but there are hints and moments of some, and the anime leaves off for a season 2 if there will be one. 
 
If it has a season 2 and actually goes into romance more i'd put this at one of my top anime so far in my no life otaku journey of 18 years. 
 
Overall im conflicted to put into 8's but its def a 8/10 so far, subjected to go higher if we ever get more.

    So, this is my first official review, and I hope to write many more after this one. 
 
Story: 6 
 
The story is a generic harem/fantasy story, filled with ""Plot"" and some battles. I liked the story and its concept, though halfway through the show, it became a bit too predictable. Though I really enjoyed certain parts, I also found myself wanting to fast forward others. 
 
Art & Sound: 7 
 
I grouped these two together because I felt like they complimented each other in this anime. The art was pretty good and consistent throughout the show, which is important. No particular sound stood out for me, but I did feel like the bgm (background music) in the battle scenes intensified the character's moves and passion. 
 
Character: 7 
 
The characters were good. Nothing more, nothing less. There weren't any exceptional or very outstanding and original traits between them, but they were good. The show had the usual harem girls, for example: a busty one, a rich one, a loli, a tsundere, and an erotic teacher etc. There were a few more, but that was the gist of it. 
 
Enjoyment & Overall: 7 
 
I did enjoy the show quite a bit, but it didn't really strike me as exceptional, partly because I have watched hundreds of similar anime and so I've kind of gotten used to all the recurring things in harem anime. The characters were alright, but neither them nor the story were able to pique my interest past the point of amusement.

    First 2 seasons of SAO were alright, decent use of CGI, fantasy, romance. 
The 3rd season is where SAO Alicization shined, it was amazing from animation to story telling and bonding between Eugeo and Kirito. 
 
However this is where this ends, as of now Underworld has really bad use of CGI, the 6th episode was really garbage due to the badly thought out battle, Kirito used to dual wield now he is dual wheeling, the plot and the supporting character's lines are badly thought out and are all emotionless, the guys who infiltrated the building had no reason to do so, Alice? What the hell is so special in her? 
Everything that has happened thus far hasn't had any reason behind other than protecting Kirito and the VR world from being destroyed by the dark territory, 
and don't even get me started on the knights, the difference between Integrity knights and Kirito 
is that Kirito actually fought, moved quick like lightning and actually had a strategy, in this series Integrity knights just point the sword towards the enemy, cast a spell which is an overpowered rainbow projectile that comes in flying and in result killing like 500 goblins. WHATT??

    The first time I learn the existence of Toradora, which is when I'm still relatively new to anime, I'm initially skeptical about the show's general quality and popularity. Googling the series promo art, the impression I get that its a stock rom-com with pretty recognizable archetypes. Ryuuji is the nice guy, Minori the genki girl, Taiga most obviously a tsundere and so on. 
 
Of course, when it comes to story, execution is really what matters and I do enjoy my share of romcom. However I found most of them not exactly to be emotionally affecting, with their conflict are generally constructed  around ""getting these two leads together"" with less-than-graceful execution. Reliance on misunderstanding, drama contrivance, just not-so-good writing all around. 
 
Toradora, however, prove itself to be a different beast. The series isn't interested in just having the characters going through all sort of shenanigans and hijinks, and also baiting the relationship between its two leads for our amusement. Toradora care for its characters, and also wants them to develop and grow. And the series does it like it was the easiest thing ever. 
 
If there is one thing Toradora is about, I'd say its about teenagers growing up, whether its moving toward maturity and/or moving past their crushes, and about good-intentioned people hiding and surpressing their feeling for one another, in order not to damage to status quo and hurt their friends, even if it will kill them. 
 
Toradora begins with a pretty dense first episode that establish all the basic variables in the story which feels like it was longer than it is, which is to its credit. It begins with the introduction of our misunderstood teenager protagonist, Ryuuji Takasu, who was avoided by his peers due to his menacing look. After an unfortunate, or fortunate, run in with another school delinquent Taiga Aisaka, he discover that she has a crush toward his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura. Coincidentally, Ryuuji himself has feelings toward Taiga's best friend, Minori Kushieda. With those knowledge in mind, the two decided to team up to help one another get closer to their respective crushes.  
 
By the time the credits roll, I feel like I've already known so much about the characters. Their personality, their struggle and what their want in their life. And the entire pacing of the episode feels natural instead of frenetic (courtesy of the series composer, Mari Goddang Okada). 
 
That was probably the moment in which Toradora grabbed my attention. The one that really makes me fell in love however, was the following episode in which Taiga finally confess her feeling to Kitamura which resulted in rejection, followed by Ryuji declaration that he'll be the dragon to Taiga's, well, tiger. 
 
Not only the event from Taiga's confession to Ryuji's declaration feels like a climax in any other romcom, it also really solidified the rapport and the relationship  between the two. 
 
From there, Toradora generally spends the entire first half of the series getting the characters into pretty much standard high school anime scenario, summer vacation at the beach, school festival, etc. But with even generally familiar scenario, the series keeps a good balance between comedy and the development of each characters psychology and relationships, in particular, Taiga and Ryuuji realization that the one they actually love are closer than they think, not the crushes they often hold in pedestal (recurring thread which Toradora likes to address).  All of this comes to a head in the more dramatic second half of the series, in which all of the characters began to realize that the world and the dynamic between them has changed, and their wish for comfortable stasis and something stable may will caused them to do bad things for one another, whether out of selflessness or selfishness. Watching the second half, you really wish for all of the characters to end up happy, but not without them hurting themselves first. 
 
The characters are pretty much the stars in Toradora. While on broadstroke, all of them has pretty basic type, the series use those type as a jumping platform for deeper characterization and even subvertion. Ryuuji is well intentioned young man who cares deeply about his friends, but his inability to read mood often caused him trouble. Taiga is a unstable girl who often lashed out on others, but it was as the result of her unhappy family live. Her best friend Minori is a cheerful energetic girl who wear a fragile mask of her own. The real standout however, was Ami. Kitamura's multi faceted childhood friend who seems to really know what's going on with each characters but couldn't do anything to help other than cryptic message as an outsider looking in. 
 
Honestly there's not much I could complain about Toradora, but I do have some complaint. For one, the beginning of Kitamura arc felt awkwardly structured, although the finale was pretty satisfying. I'm also less lenient toward the series humor, coming back. All the character-driven one are solid, but many also quote unquote anime humor, like the homeroom teacher who couldn't get married or the beginning of episode 6. And while the direction was nice, the general aesthetic, animation and music are pretty serviceable. 
 
All in all, I like Toradora. Its heartwarming emotional-ride that quite well-deserved its reputation.

         In the begining it was inspiring and it keep going and there was alot of actionIit it does have an impact on you when your watching.I watched it so many times because it's so funny it's really enjoyable for alot of people. There are some parts in the story when it's actually sad and it makes it really hard for you to stop watching. 
 
     There was no such thing as a boring part in this anime, it had a really good impact on me so if you guys try it you will enjoy it.Near the middle of the story it gets kinda sad and at the end it was ""wow, did that really happen?"" kinda affect.But it was a disapointing end.But watch it if you wanna see how it ends and how great each episode was. 
 
     PEACE!:P 
   P.S. this is only my opinion so you can make your own.

    A step up 
 
BanG Dream as an franchise for LA was kinda hard especially when the lackluster, ""in your face"" attempt in trying to say that ""idol animes are gone, bands are future"" and everything and the first season didn't exactly pan out for LA for several reasons, The 2nd Season makes some redemption towards the failures of it's first season but also brings in new flaws into the mix but overall this 2nd Season is presented in a much more focused light than the first season ever did. 
 
BanG Dream!'s 2nd Season starts off with many of the bands working on their latest lives but with Roselia being the first to maker their first self-sponsored show, this enlightens Kasumi of Poppin' Party to make one of their own, so they get ideas from the other bands. That is the first half of the anime as a whole as LA's wish to actually see some focus on the other bands finally be shown and though it's in a sorta episodic format, looking at the nature of each of the bands and their ""quirkiness"" it checks out to say the least, we get their chemistry from their band members to even interactions between other band members outside their own and it's great seeing the extended cast mingling. Of course Popping party also gets screentime and it helps that they are the narrative focus and develops alongside the rest of the bands, THIS was something LA wanted to see to be perfectly honest.  
 
The second half gets alot more tenser even more compared to the first season as a new band is formed by the name of ""Raise the Suilen"", where she recruits Tae and there comes the drama and main focal point for the second half, not only for Popping party but the rest of the bands as not only does the recruitment for Tae fractures Popping Party as well as their upcoming self sponsored show, but also the newest band are LEAGUES better than the extended main cast even rivaling Roselia, so in comes the drama of Tae trying to juggle Raise the Suilen and Poppin' Party. To some extent, the focus on Tae and her want to grow and be a better guitarist is actually quite well done and her need for that comes at the cost of her friends and Poppin' Party as a result, in a ways it's a much more dramatic and tenser situation Saaya went through during the first season. To say that LA was impressed that the direction for not only this but the entire season was much more focused is an understatement. 
 
Of course with all the praise LA will need to pick up some flaws that does detriment this season but not compared to the first season to say the least. One is that due to the extended cast, they are rather limited, especially Hello Happy World and Afterglow members especially, this season still has for the majority narrative focus towards Poppin' Party members and that's a given especially during the seocnd half but nonetheless it's a small gripe. Second is a flow on effect from the first flaw and that is the newer characters introduced, from Raise the Suilen's manager and her band that's pretty much the 765 Pro to 961 Pro of Idolmaster, cept the manager isn't a piece of shit. Lastly would be that as much of an improvement LA tout the first half, it's still kinda slog to get through before getting to the more serious stuff. 
 
LA will note the animation studios has changed from Xebec & Issen to SANZIGEN and yes almost everything has implemented 3DCGI, form it's character designs to it's live shows and in LA's opinion, this was an improvement, yes it's looks janky and stiff at first but incorporating the 3DCGI style reflects the mobile game and LA thinks SANGIZEN knew this and implemented it that way, hey at least it helped with the elimination of the jarring traditional 2D to 3D CGI with the lives as a result. ALOT of people dislike the 3DCGI change, LA approves to say the least. 
 
The voice cast returns and LA will be quick due to how huge the cast has become but the MVP's easily became Sae Otsuka as Tae and Aina Aiba as Yukina...hmm add Miku Itou as Kokoro and Ayane Sakura as Ran in there as well.  
 
BanG Dream's 2nd Season was a MARKED improvement from the first season by the sheer amount of focus it had and giving the extended cast some love as well, but even with it's flaws, it didn't outright cripple this second season, it had a foundation, worked as many elements as it could and it did itself well, not amazing but good enough for LA see to some level of improvement from the lackluster, aimless first season. BanG Dream's 3rd Season by all accounts should learn even more from this second season if it'll ever give us something to actually show that girl bands will be the future...

    This is going to be as short as MAL let me : this is the worst romcom anime ever made in history, and I can't even begin to understand how this thing made it into a manga, let alone an anime. In a way, that's impressive in itself. As you watch the show, it becomes obvious they're trying very hard to adopt a personal style of sort, some kind of artistic position to cover for the simplest flaws of the story. But I think these efforts are - mostly - unrewarded.   
I won't even bother to explain why this is unwatchable. Instead I would suggest this : watch at least one or 2 episodes of this thing and make an opinion for yourself.  
Once in a while maybe it makes sense to watch something worth nothing to fully appreciate the rest. 
Story 1/10 : still searching for the story, really. But wait, someone's suggesting it revolves around a 5th grader dating an older girl. Wow. Creativity is amaziiiiing. 
Art 4/10 : it helps when you get the feeling you've already seen this kind of art. Countless times. It is somewhat ... comforting. 
Sound 4/10 : comes with the Art, repeat again. Creativity is the next old thing anyway. 
Character 2/10 : sorry, what ? Psychology ? Never heard of that. Please stop using complicated words. 
Enjoyment 1/10 : ha ha ha. Now I'm laughing. At last. 
Overall 1/10 : Since nothing is supposed to be perfect, I suppose we could say that nothing can be that BAD. Now this anime is really hard to enjoy, but overall it was still able to avoid an abyss of things-that-could-have-been-very-wrong. So, thanks for the effort, but too bad that won't save it in the end.

        The show had good potential story-wise, but they didn't use it properly.  With the premise being an MMO game trapping players inside and the only way out is to fight and beat all 100 levels.  You would expect this show to be focus on the survival of the players, right?  Right?  Nope.  They waste the potential away.  And don't get me started on the unnecessary second half.  As well as the whole premise of being trapped in a video game not being the most original of stories as it has been done in the .Hack franchise.  However, looking at this concept outside of anime, .Hack is just as equally guilty if we were to put Tron in the argument.  As well as the show felt quite rushed, which I'm not surprised since I feel like the show should've been longer if they were to make the game 100 levels. 
 
     As well as the characters were easily the weakest link for the show, such as the, of course infamous Gary Stu character Kirito.  As well as the Asuna, who can become just an equally bland character.  Then there's Sugu/Leafa, that one character that literally feels more useless than any other character in the entire series and is literally there for fanservice.  For the supporting cast, they often are only there for one episode of screentime. 
 
    However, with failing story/character-wise, it does make up for its failure background-wise.  The backgrounds are breathe-taking, as well as the soundtrack, composed by Yuki Kajiura, being quite fair in my opinion. 
 
In conclusion, SAO isn't really that bad.  I could recommend it to anyone new to anime or for a good guilty pleasure.

    This one gets a quick review because there isn't a ton to say. Not a whole lot happens, characters do not develop much at all and the story ends without accomplishing anything.  
 
One thing I will say that made this above an average anime was that it was funny. If you ever wanted to hear a TON of sexual jokes centered around farming and see a kawaii teacher who can't find a man hit on her students and ooze desperation and negative energy you will enjoy it. The best episode is the one where he talks about it being just another average day and it is all sorts of crazy stuff that happens that makes me die laughing. It isn't bad for a comedy but the other elements are sorely lacking and the tropes are too strong.

    *This is a spoilerfree review* 
 
This is my favourite anime of all time.  
Honestly it is the cutest, funniest and most addicting BL story I have ever had the pleasure of being addicted to.  
If you are into BL, Shounen ai and the like, this really is a MUST watch. 
 
The anime (and manga alike) are divided into stories about several couples. I know a lot of people who have watched this feel like they could do with only following the main story, and I can agree with this to a certain degree as their story is the most elaborate one and probably also the most infatuating of them. BUT I honestly have to say that I enjoy them all, and the anime certainly wouldn't be the same without them. 
 
As to why you should watch this particular anime I would start off by mentioning Takano-san, as he is one of my all time favourite characters and makes this story so much better than it already is. Forceful, manly and to the point that is what i love about him.  
As you watch and learn about the past and present hidden feelings in the relationship between him and the main protagonist Onodera, it makes your heart ache both in agony and in excitement for the two of them as they live their (not so separate) lives, being pulled closer and closer together. 
 
As I mentioned before, in addition to this couple you get the pleasure of watching three other couples whose stories supplement the main one, bringing you different perspectives and  make out separate pieces of the full story. 
 
To sum it all up, this is a romance story where you don't have to wait for the action to start, it hits you right out of the gate and holds you in front of your screen until you're suddenly done with the whole thing.  
Definitely a story worth watching, and one that will make you cry and laugh along with the characters as they fall in and out of love.  
 ""doki doki""

    Story: The two episodes of this OVA gave a very basic story, although it is a basic story, it has a good amount of detail to it and I found I wasn't lost when watching them. 
 
Art: The art was good, I liked how the backgrounds and characters were drawn. I don't have much to say for this category. 
 
Sound: Their voice actors sounded correct for their character. 
 
Character: The character development and explanation was very well thought up. 
 
Enjoyment: This isn't my type of OVA, although I do like the occasional hentai, this category isn't my type. 
 
Overall I'd give this a 7, the storyline, art and characters were good enough to bring up the score for the bad side. 
 
Do I recommend? I recommend this OVA if you like hentai and enjoy watching someone getting mentally broken, while also having a willing sex slave.

    First: The english is not my language, so it can contain some afwul mistakes... 
This is one of in my anime list that i really sure is mediocre, because have a good plot but the character are really mediocre, all of the intent to make identified to the rebelion is take to the poor, because all of the girls need a sensational ecchi scene... 
I thinks the industries in all the time uses ecchi to make more effective to transport their product, but this is killing good series, like this. Its love and hate... 
All of the problems that have the series, its how to entry the characters in the situations. 
And if you like yep its good, but is horrible serie, yep thats true... 
(Like SAO, Overlord, NGNL)

    This is a story that constantly quotes and references Hamlet and The Tempest, both works of Shakespeare. Some people will love that fact, while others may be a little annoyed. I thought it was done very well, and I really loved the theme and the execution of this series. I have not read the Manga it is based on, but I never expected to love this series going into it. I was pleasantly surprised and it's now one of my favorites. It is a great blend of story, dialogue, action, and it has a great visual and audio presentation. 
 
What's it about? The synopsis doesn't really say. It's about magic, it's about relationships, it's about the end of the world, and it's about quirky characters that interact with each other in very bizarre ways. It's difficult to describe without throwing spoilers around. Think ""Shakespeare Play"" and you'll get the feel of it right away! 
 
This is one of those beautifully done series as far as artwork and animation goes. It's consistent, it's good quality and it has some wow moments. The music fits well, and it enhances the experience, and the voice acting is done very well. Being filled with so much dialogue, this is an important piece for them to nail and I think they did just that. I loved the package, I loved the execution, and I really think it shines in these elements. 
 
The characters of Zetsuen no Tempest were dysfunctional, unexpected, and yet wonderful at the same time. The two main characters were not your stereotypical heroes, in fact their roles in this story were borderline bizarre. This story is based on the emotional involvement of these main characters. They do have their awesome moments early on, but later in the story are not the dominant ""action heroes"" of the tale by any means. The fate of the world revolves around the ""feelings"" of all parties involved, and the two main characters relationship with each other keep the fate of mankind hanging in the balance. It is a character driven story, and the characters are not swarming with stereotypes. I loved that fact about Zetsuen no Tempest, and I think it gives it that little extra something. 
 
Now the story.... I loved the story, though it's filled with plot holes and flawed logic. The flawed logic is going to really bother some people, but the constant reference to the flawed logic of “the world” really almost pokes fun at the story in general. It’s a little ridiculous while being absolutely wonderful at the same time. The fact is that the flaws are used as storytelling devices, and it's the plot holes and flaws that help tell the story properly. It is a little obvious at times, but it has some nice little twists and surprises that keep it fresh. Best of all it’s told in such a way that it was easy to watch week to week. I looked forward to every episode and the cliffhangers were done very well. 
 
I really loved this series. It was different enough to feel fresh while being absurd and intriguing at the same time. I loved the main characters and I loved how it tried to imitate Shakespeare in its delivery. The fast and quirky dialogue while focusing on the interpersonal relationships made this series special. I highly recommend it!

    Despite the popular consensus , Toradora! is not a romance anime. Allow me to explain. 
 
In a standard romance anime, the two romantic leads are generally supported by a secondary cast whose sole purpose is to act as cheerleaders for the leads and push them together. That isn't the case here, as all of the supporting cast have their own motives and reasons to exist within the story. 
 
Ryuji and Taiga, as the romantic leads, aren't really romantic leads in the usual sense. The story isn't demanding they pair up as in most romantic series; they, too, have motivations outside of being a couple.  As a consequence, the entire cast is a group of likable characters, even though one or two take some time becoming likable. 
 
The animation is quite well done, even though the quality drops at certain points. This only happens rarely, but it's hard to miss. 
 
The sound is really good, with a good opening song for the first half of the series. At certain points, when ""Lost my Pieces"" plays (and you'll know when you hear it), expect feels. 
 
The english dub (I haven't personally heard the sub), is one of the finest in all of anime (Cassandra Morris is wonderful as Taiga), and as such deserves to heard by as many people as possible. 
 
All in all, Toradora! is very enjoyable, with a lot of humour throughout and a good 
cast of characters.

    At school, you may have some boring teachers, and you may sleep through their lessons; then, you may also have some teachers you actually like, and you're actually engaged in their lessons. For example, the teacher for assassination class is - Wait, assassination?! Since when does a school teach their students about assassination?! Well, if you're in Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, you would know the answer to that question. I don't remember exactly when it was that I first found out about Assassination Classroom, nor do I remember when was it that I decided that I was going to watch it; all I can say is that it was very enjoyable. 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, tentacles all over, here is my review for Assassination Classroom. 
 
Assassination Classroom begins with a large portion of the moon being destroyed, turning it into a permanent crescent. (That's right, folks, full moons are now a thing of the past!) The one responsible for this catastrophe is a giant, yellow, octopus-like.... thing. Oh, you know how I mentioned what happened to the moon? Yeah, apparently, Earth's next, but first, the octopus thing, eventually named Koro-sensei, wants to teach Class 3-E at Kunugigaoka Junior High for a year! As a result, the students of Class 3-E are given an assignment; they have to assassinate Koro-sensei before graduation, with the prize for doing so being 10 billion yen! Of course, with that big of a bounty on his head, it's obvious that Koro-sensei is no easy target; he can move at Mach 20 speed, which makes it easy for him to dodge all of their attacks. It's not just that that's getting in their way (although Nagisa Shiota does take notes on his weaknesses); it's also how Koro-sensei is the best teacher they have ever had. Much emphasis on ever is used here, considered how badly Class E is normally treated. 
 
Yeah, the story of Assassination Classroom can be quite interesting. It has a bit of a comedy/slice-of-life feel mixed with all of the students' attempts to assassinate their teacher, and it mixes in a bit of the academics, as well. What makes the story of Assassination Classroom interesting, however, is its characters. This anime is full of interesting characters, with not even one dull one. Saying that Koro-sensei is a great teacher is a great understatement; despite how he plots to destroy the Earth the way he did the moon, he puts his students first. He doesn't just teach them school subjects; he teaches them about life and goes above and beyond to help them with their problems. Koro-sensei isn't the only interesting character, though. A majority of the Class E students are likable, especially Karma, Nagisa, Kayano, and Ritsu. If there's any character in this anime I don't like, it's any student besides those in Class E; I just hated how poorly Class E is treated by others. They may be the lowest class, but the LEAST you could do is be at least a LITTLE bit nice to them! 
 
The animation in AssClass (am I the only one who is amused by this abbreviation?), done by Lerche, was very well-done. It really stands out in the action scenes; with the fluid animation in the action scenes, you can really feel yourself getting into it. I alternated between watching this in Japanese (with English subs) and English (dubbed, of course), and I have to say that both versions have good voice acting. I also liked both opening themes, ""Seishun Satsubatsu-ron"" and ""Jiriki Hongan Revolution""; they were very upbeat. While the ending theme, ""Hello, shooting star"", was also great, sometimes, I didn't feel it didn't really fit this anime. 
 
Overall, Assassination Classroom is a very good anime. If you like anime that focus on teachers trying to teach their students (some other examples being Negima and Denpa Kyoushi), I think I'd automatically recommend this one. There are quite some interesting and funny things happening in the assassination classroom, where the students are assassins and their target is their teacher!

    STORY (8/10) 
The story of spice and wolf is overly simplistic, but don’t get me wrong, simple things can be the best things. Ookami to Koushinryou is a story about Lawrence, a traveling merchant and Holo, a wolf deity. While economics do play a part in spice and wolf, you shouldn’t let it stop you if you don’t like the subject. The economics are really interesting in the series, you can see how Lawrence do his trades and earn his money, but obviously the story isn’t only about this. On a personal point I think it’s the characters that make this series original and good. 
 
SOUND (8/10) 
I love spice and wolf ost’s, the opening is great, it fits so well with the anime, even the ending is good (even if it’s ‘’engrish’’). I really loved Holo and Lawrence voices, they fit perfectly. The background ost’s really add a good atmosphere in the anime, they are unique, it’s the kind of ost that I enjoy listening while doing other things. 
 
CHARACTERS (9/10) 
This is by far the best part of spice and wolf. The characters are so unique. Holo is an awesome character, her personality is well made and she’s an original character, she’s not your main tsundere girl you will see in every anime. Lawrence is a good character too, this guy doesn’t know how to talk to a girl which can be funny sometimes, how he doesn’t understand how Holo thinks, and he’s a cool merchant, what else can I say? The relationship between our two main characters are something that I really enjoyed, there’s always a ‘’tease and tease back’’ when they talk together. It’s really enjoyable and they are the type of characters you will eventually care for as the story goes. 
 
ENJOYMENT (8/10) 
If you’re someone like me who really enjoys when characters are well made and are not left undeveloped you will definitely enjoy everything about spice and wolf. As a light novel reader I think the season one was really well adapted, they did not leave weird plot holes that they could have done by skipping light novels things, which is really enjoyable. I would definitely re-watch spice and wolf in a year or two. I can’t, but suggest anyone who loves spice and wolf to read the novels, they are awesome. Spice and Wolf as surely climb to my top five favorite series of all time 
 
OVERALL: 8/10, would recommend 
 
TL:DR: Story is great, characters are awesome, memorable series, if you like spice and wolf I suggest that you read the novel to continue this awesome adventure!

    Well, I finally did it, though I was never actually opposed to it, but I've had more of an interest in hentai lately and one of the tags listed at the website I watched this anime was crossdressing. That always catches my eye, so I thought I'd give it a try. 
 
The story isn't very deep, just as the synopsis said, its about two young teens in a family who take pleasure in sex tormenting or exploring others at their huge mansion and estate, which is infrequently visited by their father. Sometimes they seem naughty innocents: just wanting to have a good time or learn new techniques, but at others can be mildly cruel in meting out their ""punishment"" to their victim.  
 
What's not listed in the synopis or included in the tags on most of the sites I saw carried the episodes, is that the first one explicitly features bestiality. That wasn't a shock to me, in and of itself, but it was unexpected. And unlike human sexual parts, the animals were not censored. Let's just put it that way. The second episode that I saw was uncensored. 
 
Family of Debauchery has its intended affect, at least it did for me anyway. Definitely a guilty pleasure, but it was at least coherent and the art was comparable to an average ""regular"" anime, somewhat old school. If you are looking to get hot, the action is regular and varied. I've actually rewatched both episodes.

    This Pokemon Movie, I'd have to say was good for the most part. 
 
-Story- 
The story plot was FAIR. When I originally heard about the movie, I thought it would be much much much different. Since I've been a Pokemon Fan for most of my life, I was expecting the movies to have much more of a Climatical part. It did not have a true &quot;climax&quot; per se. It was an average movie with an average storyline. 
 
-Art- 
The art was nothing special. The best art I saw was at the very end. The art was just as if it was a regular old Pokemon episode. 
 
-Sound- 
Sound was my favorite part. I loved the theme song in both English and Japanese, and I loved how the ending theme stayed the same. I also loved the song Aracion. 
 
-Character- 
Of course, Ash, Brock, and Dawn make an appearance, being the main Characters. I didn't see anything outstanding in the adding of the movie characters. Just like the episodes, there was nothing that made them stand out. 
 
-Enjoyment- 
When I watch a movie, I want to have somewhat the same thrill of when I watched it the very first time. I want it to be moving. When I watched this movie, I saw it all. I only re-watch it if my friends wants to see it again or if I was going to be in a Pokemon TCG tourney the next day. 
 
-Overall- 
Overall, it earns a fair 7. It was decent the first time through, but after that, it just gets boring and more boring.

    I both love and hate the show.  
 
This will be the first mecha I.P I've watched, and quite honestly I enjoyed that aspect of it, a lot. I loved how their was little introduction to the world. It was refreshing compared to some of my favourite series', as they can sometimes takes quite a while to get up to speed. 
 
I really dig the art style and overall aesthetics. I'm willing to ignore the clear budget problems the studio had during development, as not much can be done about it. The colours were bright, but not oversaturated. I've never liked the 80/90s aesthetic, but this might have changed my view on it, which I'm certainly happy about. 
 
I enjoyed the characters as well. I can relate to Shinji quite well, which made the show more interesting to me, as I actually understood where the character is coming from. Rei was a more of a slow burn, and I do think more attention could have been paid to her as well as Asuka. What the show was really missing was more interaction between the three. They never felt connected, despite having to watch each others backs during battle.  
 
It's the story that really ruins the show for me. Whatever the reason's behind why the show ended as it did, I can't help but feel a little disapointed. What disapointed me the most was the great plot build up over the first 20 episodes, which could have been taken so much further. I read somewhere that the creator didn't know where the show was headed, and it really does show. It just kinda flops at the end, and tries to make a meaningful end, but just feels hollow and empty. I'd be fine if the show showed it's intent from the start, but TBH, it just felt like a ""normal"" story at the start, and during the final episodes, a completely different show. 
 
Am I glad I watched it?, a resounding yes. Not just another notch on my anime belt, but something different to what I'm used to. But no show is a great show without an actual ending, no matter how well it starts. At the end of a show you should feel complete and content, but Evangelion leaves you high and dry, wanting for more. I give a pity 8 score as I feel the show could have been much more, and most aspects of it are good, despite it's development issues.

    Ok, I'm aware that this series has both a manga and a light novel series, but i've not seen any of them. However, I've watched S1 of this series. And I've seen a few reviews written about this series in MAL too, and most say this seires is not that good. I disagree, my reasons are below... 
 
[Specialty-Harem and Slow Romance] 
[Weakness- some unconnected episodes and unexplained stuff] 
 
Story:6 
To be honest it's a bit disappointing. Cause there were quite a lot of scenes loaded with some form of fanservice, or at least were short on details. I infer that a lot of content from the light novel has been cut out. 
 
Those who watch this after S1 may feel a bit dismal at the quality of the storyline. Reason being: the main focus of Haruka being an otaku is gone, cos she no longer has to keep it a secret, and the original plot you can't really see it in S2. S2 is more of the romance build-up between Haruka and Yuuto (slow type, like Yume de Aetara manga), some unconnected episodes featuring new girls who fall in love with Yuuto, and some events here and there. 
 
I really like the unconnected harem episodes where Haruka disappears and the episodes where Yuuto and Haruka ""bond together"", cause there were often many emotional scenes. That's why although the S2 isn't as exciting as the first, it is still of a fairly high quality in storyline and progression. 
 
The ending was similar to S1, and still a lot of harem relationships were still not resolved and unexplained (That's why I said they are unconnected). 
 
Art:8 
Fairly hgih quality, a few great special effects, but not much change of art quality. Same to S1. 
 
Sound:8 
It may be a mistake, but I actually felt that S2 is better than S1 in terms of the bgms. They were well-placed and well-cut-off and as usual, the voice acting is good, some parts having excellent voice acting. And the bgms really raised the mood for most of the scenes, especially the emotional ones. 
 
Character:6 
This is quite sad. A lot of characters show up but play almost no part in any of the episodes, for example the rest of the maid team that did not show up in S1. Then a lot of side characters may disappear for 3 or more eps then come back again. And the new girls who fall in love with Yuuto (Yes, the harem is realistic) may feature in only 1 or 2 full episodes then disappear again. 
 
1 major flaw could be that Haruka isn't really an otaku or a very well-known girl in this season. Most of the times I have an impression that she is just a normal girl who likes 1 show, the Lacrosse High School Club or sth. So, S2 is really not as exciting as S1 as 2 unique points of the main female character had been more or less abandoned. 
 
And 1 problem with Yuuto is he's really really super dense. It 'wows' me at times. And he's also super super kind at the ""right"" times. A little too perfect of a gentleman... 
 
Enjoyment:6-8 
Really can't decide. At the end of S2 I feel quite empty. Cause a lot of things were unexplained and unresolved. So many things that I wonder if S2 is following the main novel. Some potential passed on from S1 were still undeveloped in S2. Really sad... 
 
But to be honest I liked S2, some eps were very touching, and at other times inspirational. I enjoyed the very realistic setting of the romance featured between 2 reserved people, and could really feel the love between the 2. 
Aww

    I might sound lame, but I just watched Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion last October 2011. Most of my fellow animé enthusiast friends tell me this same line in a surprised tone: ""What? You're just watching it now?"" Personally, I don't get why they're so surprised that I was just about to watch Code Geass. I just started in the whole animé thing at that time, after all. 
 
Then I watched Code Geass. Then I figured out why they were so surprised at me. Code Geass doesn't just pass as some standard animé title; Code Geass is a story of epic proportions, with a lead character who you'd probably least expect to be one of your future favorite characters, nonetheless one of the most celebrated characters in animé history--or animation history, in general. 
 
Code Geass presents itself as a cut above the rest; after all, you don't get to watch shows about anti-hero leads frequently. You don't get to watch anti-hero leads with mechas frequently, either. Code Geass manages to mix two genres, already detail-heavy on their own, and still come out as a masterpiece definitely deserving of the numerous awards already awarded to it. Here's why. 
 
Story, for a short review, is simply amazing. Lelouch Lamperouge, our lead here, is as outstanding as he gets. Not only is he the perfect anti-hero, he's also the vice-president of his school student council. Code Geass meshes the two facets of his life--as a student and as a rebellious individual--and turns it into an orchestrated story which blurs the line between the two distinctly different faces of his daily life. Bring that with an initial premise as revolutionary as it is amazing, and you get a story that spans ideals and beliefs. You never thought an animé would ever get this deep a story. At least I did. 
 
Art doesn't fall behind the story. CLAMP didn't fail in implementing their already unique style to the already unique story. This joint effort results in an animation truly a cut above the rest. Mecha designs rival those of the famous Gundam series. Code Geass seemingly overflows with creativity in both story and design. It's just like in a picture I saw on the net about Code Geass. Expectations: Cardcaptor Sakura + Japan; Reality: Death Note + Gundam. To whoever made this, well played. 
 
The melodies present in this series truly augments to the high tensions and the mellow moments present in the story. I don't usually download animé soundtracks, but Code Geass is the first exception. I've downloaded a few others after it, but Code Geass will always be the first. Opening and ending themes are also excellent. FLOW's ""COLORS"" and Ali Project's ""Yuukyou Seishunka"" make for great first opening and ending themes, respectively. I'll leave it to you guys to find out the other opening and ending theme. 
 
And here comes Code Geass' strongest aspect: character. You can easily rename this series as ""Lelouch Lamperouge"" and everyone probably wouldn't mind (though as a side note, its subtitle is ""Lelouch of the Rebellion""). The story circles around Lelouch's development as an anti-hero and how he manages to blend it in with his everyday life. The story also shows how his family and friends slowly adapt to his peculiar tendencies in everyday life, and how his fellow revolutionaries slowly learn how he acts as a leader. Code Geass, above anything else, is about human emotional growth. That's my opinion, because I believe that each character's development is responsible for the great story this animé possesses. 
 
I rarely give perfect 10s for any animé I rate. Yet somehow, I find myself in awe of what this show delivers to me. It goes beyond simple viewing and watching--it's a experience. Code Geass takes you to stories where you find yourself sympathizing with the characters, especially Lelouch. It's even more astounding to think that this show has a sequel.

    I finally finished it! I started watching this show from the very first episode but couldn’t get through it for a year, that’s probably a bad sign, but I’m proud myself for finishing it anyway  
 
I don’t have much to say about it, the metaphors were heavy-handed and obvious, so much so that I found myself rolling my eyes a couple times an episode(especially at the wedding ). And yes like other people have said, it did have a much better start, it did get pretty rough at the end but I will mention that I thought the ending was very nice, it was the best ending of an anime that I’ve seen in a while, regardless of how the rest of the series was.  
 
If it had been shorter and changed just a couple things I could easily see myself giving this an 8, but as it is I was pretty much just forcing myself to watch it

    This anime was beautiful. Honestly, I can't think of a better word to use. Yes, it has nudity, and extreme gore, making it many male fans very happy, however, I enjoyed it all the same. 
The nudity was not overdone in a ""fan-service"" kind of way. It seemed to go along with the plot well.  
 
Now, the story is absolutely creative. And, in only 13 episodes, somehow they develop it into an amazing climatic masterpiece.  
Same with the characters. All of the main ones get their own development. Of course, the main ones, like Kouta and Nyu/Lucy go more in depth a bit.  
I still do not understand how they can make an anime, have you hooked in 1-2 episodes, develop characters and plot, have a creative story, an intense ending that is, again, beautiful, in just 13 flippin episodes.  
 
This would probably best be described as a tragic sort of anime. Just the style and the way things are done. But the emotions run high and I became probably way too attacked by the end.  
 
This will probably remain high on my list of favorite animes.

    When I saw the words ""Another: Episode 0"", I was excited 
 
The episode does not share the same ominous atmosphere the TV series had. But for fans of the series (such as myself), it's a necessary episode to watch. Why? Because it's a missing ""piece of the puzzle"" that properly explains the reason behind Mei's forlorn personality and attitude towards the curse. 
 
I feel that this episode reveals the reason why she chose not to interfere with the deaths of the curse victims despite having the ability to do so and also why she chose not to reveal the identity of ""the dead person"". 
[Minor spoiler] Because while watching this episode I realised that Mei must have somehow predicted/noticed the impending death of her sister (probably through her ""eye"") and attempted to save her [see Ferris Wheel scene]. In the end however, her sister died anyway and Mei realised that she couldn't do anything about her sister's death afterall.  
Which is why in the series, she felt that it wouldn't have made a difference whether she revealed or tried to help the victims at all.  
 
Of course, that's just my personal opinion. Maybe I'm thinking too much but that's how I'm going to interpret the episode. 
It's important for everyone to watch it and come to their own conclusion.

    Short review:  
I found this anime to be very enjoyable and well executed. The characters were great, the story was simple yet effective, and the English dub is better than the original voice acting. However, the artwork and animation quality is extremely average, and the music, while unique, was not a highlight of this anime.  
 
Loooooooong review: 
 
Story: Fruits Basket takes a very slice-of-life approach to telling its story, with each episode being rather self contained. Often times, an episode is spent getting to know one of the members of the Sohma family (most often a guy, you know, because of the whole Tohru-hugging-them-thing to reveal what animal they are.) There are your standard slice-of-life episodes, including a hot springs, school festival, and Valentine's Day episodes that we've all probably seen many times before. But this isn't a bad thing, as characters are developed and moral lessons are taught basically every episode of Fruits Basket. This wasn't just a tack-on, because it never felt forced or dumb. Instead, I found myself smiling uncontrollably at times while watching this anime, and other times in a state of awe or loss. I've mentioned before in my reviews that I don't really like episodic shows. But I think part of the reason Fruits Basket worked for me is because I went into this anime with barely any expectations. It's because of this method of storytelling that I don't consider this anime AS MUCH of a shojo as others would say, to be honest. The comedy is actually fairly innocent, with only a sprinkling of sexuality here and there. It's rather light, without it being the focus of the story, and it's primary niche is its quirkiness. There's also plenty of drama and depressing, thought-provoking moments in Fruits Basket, so not everything is bishis, rice balls, and comedy routines. I thought the drama was handled really well, and was entirely believable, instead of it all feeling superficial. Overall, because of how Fruits Basket handled its' story, I would actually recommend this to be the first shojo anime anyone watches. But a bit of advice here: skip episode 22. It was such a pain to watch, personally, and I don't think it added to the story that much. The ending I found to be interesting, actually, in that is followed the manga instead of diverging off, like what Ouran did.  
 
Characters:  
As usual for slice-of-life and shojo anime, Fruits Basket is a very character-driven show. Every character is unique, has their own quirks, and a different problem in their life. The cast of Fruits Basket is actually rather large, but to me, it didn't feel like the characters were based too much on common archetypes of shojo anime. All these beastly boys and girls revolve around our protagonist Tohru Honda, who's sweeter and kinder than a teddy bear decked out in pink ribbons holding a basket of Mars Bars. Her desire to improve the lives of everyone around her is matched only by her desire to not be a burden to anyone. This may make her come off as a cookie-cutter or annoying character. I didn't think so, because she's not perfect; she has her own problems. There'a a certain joy I got out of these characters simply by seeing a character come back after their respective spotlight episode. It's the feeling of character relationships growing and changing that often brought each episode to a close, and very often made me feel extremely satisfied, just by seeing these characters interact. What Fruits Basket tries to emphasize with its characters is that no one is perfect. Characters still have flaws, even after Tohru manages to change their hearts. One thing I noticed about the characters in Fruits Basket is how a lot of them can pull a 180 character flip rather quickly and frequently. Yuki? Check. Kyo? Check. Kagura? Check. Hatsuharu? Oh yeah. This is mostly for comedic effect, but is occasionally used for drama and character development, like with Momiji or Kisa. And when the show does this, it's GOOD. I found myself holding my hands to my mouth from the shock of back-stories and thoughtful words that came from these characters' mouths. But I can almost guarantee to anyone that there will be a character you will love, and one that is absolutely annoying. I've heard from the haters of this show complain about all the characters being annoying, and to be honest, sometimes I can see where they're coming from. The only reason I can understand this is because of the character that was annoying for me, Hiro Sohma. Even though he did change a little for the better, this kid is almost as much of a brat as Aloise Trancy. (And he even looks like him) 
 
Art:  
It pains me to say this, but there isn't anything that great about the art in Fruits Basket. But this is probably due to the fact that this anime was made back in 2001. From what I've seen, Studio Deen has only recently made anime with decent artwork, such as Hetalia and Is This A Zombie. All the character designs are very simple, but at the same time, classic shojo. The distinguishing feature of the characters is almost always the hair. The art is a bit different than the manga (which I am reading, actually), which must have come as a bit of a shock to those that watched Fruits Basket when it first aired. The color pallet is very muted and pastel, with probably the brightest thing being Kyo's hair. The use of exaggerated backgrounds during comedic scenes added to the effectiveness and appeal to the comedy. The set pieces have a hand painted look to them, but not so much that it is blatantly obvious, a la 1994 Sailor Moon. Overall, the art is a bit dated, but at the same time has aged surprisingly well. The simple sweetness of the art perfectly compliments the nature and tone of Fruits Basket. 
 
Animation:  
As I've said before, animation is not usually the highlight of a shojo anime. Fruits Basket is one of Studio Deen's classic titles, and as I said above, they still aren't the best when it comes to animation. Animation is usually kept to a minimum, and sometimes small motions are repeated or go through loops. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing this time and is a bit understandable, as I believe Fruits Basket was animated at least partially with traditional cels. There are your typical anime shortcuts for emotion or action (anger veins, speed lines, the river of tears, many arms and legs while running, etc.) But the exaggerations are a good part of what made the comedy funny, and I just can't imagine Fruits Basket without them, really. 
 
Voice:  
Like I often do, I'm recommending watching this anime dubbed, partially because Yuki sounds nothing like a guy in Japanese. Yes, you have Laura Bailey, Eric Vale, and Jerry Jewell (common Funimation leads) as Tohru, Yuki, and Kyo, respectively, but I didn't really recognize anyone else on the cast list. Which is good if you often associate English voice actors with their other roles in anime. Many old dubs are associated with being cheesy, but Fruits Basket is a bit of a different case. Either I didn't mind the cheesiness, or the anime was very often cheesy so the script went well with the anime. Probably a mix of both. Chris Sabat pulled off a flawlessly flamboyant Ayame, Kent Williams a cold-but-kind Hatori, and John Burgmeier was outstanding as the perverted, but fatherly Shigure. I think everyone pulled off their roles well, though some of the actors or actresses fell a bit short when it came to the drama moments. But I think this dub worked very effectively with the comedy, and that is enough for me to call this a good dub. There isn't much about this dub that can be called ""outstanding,"" but there's nothing wrong with it, either, so if the sub and dub are equal, I always choose dub.  
 
Music: 
The opening and ending themes are both quiet, simple, sweet, but overall unremarkable. They're easily skippable, unless you like that sort of thing. A lot of the OST is as quirky or fun as the characters. Other times, the tracks were just ""little sounds"", simple melodies, or just piano pieces. Now, none of these tracks are bad, it just sometimes feels like the OST isn't there, really. It seemed to me that the only purpose for most of the OST was to make the slice-of-life sound very cute and fun. However, I give the OST points for being unique.  
 
Execution: 
I can't judge execution for Fruits Basket as much as I can with other anime, simply because of my lack of expectations when I started. If you're looking for a full-on shojo romance anime, you may be a bit disappointed with Fruits Basket. Thankfully, I did not have this mindset or expectation while watching this anime, so I thought the slice-of-life was handled and worked really well. And it wasn't just about the pretty boys, I also thought the balance between the comedy and the drama/character development was really great as well, giving Fruits Basket a lot more substance than if it was just a plain slice-of-life. This anime works perfectly fine as a shojo, but I consider this anime the kind that will cheer you up and put a big smile on your face. Fruits Basket is the kind of anime where you just watch one or two episodes after a long day, instead of marathoning it on the weekend.  
 
My Enjoyment:  
There were plenty of times in Fruits Basket where I could not stop smiling. And when the show did get serious, I felt myself really sympathizing with the characters. Sure, there were a few annoying characters, but thankfully, I can count them on one hand, and they didn't show up often in the anime. Fruits Basket is my second favorite shojo anime of all time, but I think that's because I've seen more bad ones than good. It's mainly because of this anime that I don't consider myself a slice-of-life hater, a sort of beacon of past glory, in the sea of moe girl slice-of-life that occupies much of anichart every season. So, other than a few hiccups,and this was all due to personal taste, really, my enjoyment of Fruits Basket was very consistent.

    Boy meets girl,after some hesitation they start dating,problems comes,problem solved and they continue dating,anime ends. But... this anime tweaks a few things which makes it intresting and enjoyable to watch. 
 
Story: 8 - This story revolves around the Risa and Ohtani as the former is taller than average while the latter is shorter than the usual and as time goes by Risa realises she feels more for him than as friends. I liked this anime a lot because despite having an unoriginal story, it proves to us that by adding a few extra things can have a impact. 
 
Art: 8 - At times I found the art a bit sluggy but overall it was a good job as it fulfills its duty. 
  
Sound: 8 - I liked the soundtrack because it had a refreshing and youthful feeling which is necessary for this type of anime which is why I found the it good. 
 
Character: 8 - I think the main characters were done quite well as they contrasted and fulfilled each other perfectly even though I found the other characters a bit stereotypical but they are bareable. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 - Though i'm not up for rom-com shoujos as I find all of them them almost the same but if you're bored then you'll enjoy it. This anime is suited for people who can bare slow-paced series but overall you'll enjoy it. 
 
People who liked: Kimi Ni Todoke, 
 
Overall: 8 - Overall I liked this series for it's original element of troubles. This series can be seen by anyone as long as you have patience.

    Few things to start with; 
 
My overall rating in this review and rating for the show on my list differ, that is due to MAL not having unified rating. 10/10 on the site is described as ""masterpiece"" while 10/10 in reviews is described as ""outstanding"", while the show is indeed outstanding I don't like to throw word ""masterpiece"" around. 
 
Episode 11 has aired as of writing this review. Art, sound and enjoyment aspects of my rating are not going to change but story and character might depending on how the story develops and on how it concludes (since the source is completed & it's a two course show I do expect that what we are getting is completed story i.e. no s2).  
 
I will talk about story & characters last since they are  the variables and are arguably the most important parts; 
 
Art 9/10; 
 
While I do admittedly have fetish for most of I.G.'s art styles the art/animation fit the show very well. There is no part of the animation that would seem out of place and there are some seriously gorgeous scenes. The reason it's not a ten is the fact that there are anime series/movies that set the bar extremely high. So again and in conclusion, the art fits and does what it needs to while making the show look nice. 
 
Sound 10/10; 
 
Sound&soundtrack fit the show and there is not a piece of the sound design within the show that I could point out and call bad or/and out of place. Both OP and ED are memorable. The soundtrack is enjoyable even out of context i.e. on it's own. 
 
Enjoyment 10/10; 
 
I sat through 11 episodes without a stop and didn't even notice it which is very rare thing for me.  
 
Story 8/10 & Characters 9/10 (spoiler free) 
 
The character cast is on the outside very nice and fairly diverse. I've noticed that the show has 2 characters marked as ""main"" and rest as ""supporting"" which I'd have to disagree with, while the show does have two distinctive MCs the entire group of characters should be taken as a main cast. All of the characters have seemingly distinctive personalities, ways and interests which actually do make them feel human what's more, they (their personalities and actions) do react to what's happening around them all of that together makes it very easy for you to actually sympathize with them & what they go through during the show.There are some weird ""blunders"" when it comes to it but it's all within reason. As it is, I am torn between 8 and 9, I can't give the cast a 10 because while atm. it's all coming nicely together it heavily depends on how they move&change with and throughout the rest of the story since there will be very little time to ""give"" to the individual cast members (that said, it might end up being a 10 ^-^). 
 
The story while being surprisingly good is at the moment the weakest part of the show. The setting is extremely fresh which is weird considering it takes place at a college but it does seem to be a rare specimen ^-^. The story itself feels believable which is without a doubt partially thanks to the cast but it's overall very realistic It's hard to put into words because while the show is more or less ""sports anime"" it's not exactly about the sport itself, rather than that it's about people living their lives with the sport being a part (bigger and bigger part as the story goes on) of it. As mentioned before, the characters have different interests and while all being college students they are at different points in their lives, the show manages to highlight their differences and how they deal with them, their problems and each other extremely well, there are moments of both happiness and sadness but it all comes as heartwarming. The show also manages to shift  between comedy and drama smoothly which makes the ""process"" feel natural. The story has a rating of 8 mainly because there are some dull moments and the story does focus on some ""uninteresting"" things from time to time which becomes an issue when you have fairly limited amount of episodes while having wide repertoire of themes and moments you could be showing the viewer. The story might end on a 9 but it could also be a 7 or a 6 depending on how it continues and ends, the final arc of the show and it's conclusion will be vital for both the story and the character cast. 
 
To add little something to the ""sports anime"" thingy I abruptly ended, the anime isn't about people coming out of nowhere trying to be the best and whatnot, rather it's about people who have their own lives to live and the sport itself is becoming a part of that. 
 
 
To conclude, I would suggest the show to pretty much anyone. It's hard to pinpoint how much time you should give the show before deciding to either drop or watch it all (since it's a 2 course and thus a fairly large time investment) so watch an episode or two and if you find yourself enjoying it stick with it. While the show needs few episodes to show you what it really has to offer if you find out that you are forcing yourself half-way through the second episode it's not very likely that the show is for you.

    This will be my first ever review so sorry for any mistakes. 
 
Barakamon is a refreshing easygoing anime. Something you don't need very much energy or attention to sit through. Nothing gets too heavy and the atmosphere is very lax. 
 
Story: 7 
 
The story of the show is quite simple, which is fitting for the mood of the show. The plot has no overall conflict and its really just 12 episodes of the characters playing around. The humor of the show is surprising enjoyable as well.  
 
Art: 8  
 
The art and animation are well done in terms of quality and the color is just as stunning. the use of light colors gives more of the feeling that they're in a rural town. 
 
Sound: 7 
 
Nothing much to say here. The sounds were fairly generic and while the ink splashes sounded great it didn't affect the overall show. 
 
Character: 9 
 
The characters in the show are all lovable. It works out even better when you put Handa who isn't very good at socializing with a bunch of country folk who are all very local with each other. It creates scenarios that you don't usually get with animes like these. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
I gotta say the show was incredibly enjoyable and so were the characters. The humor is great and the setting is comfortable. However because the shows story doesn't have a plot line to go down the story can get repetitive. 
 
Overall: 8 
 
A very laid back and fun show to watch. Even if you're not into these kind of SoL 12 episodes of playing kind of animes, i still recommend you try Barakamon.

    If you were like me, you are probably thinking about watching this show because it looks like another Saekano. Surprise: it’s not! 
 
Girls Beyond the Wasteland is a series about a group of friends/schoolmates getting together to make a bishojou game. They all bring a different skillset to the table and serve in different positions: Buntarou is the script writer; Andou is the coder; Yuuki is the artist; Yuuka is the voice actress (voiced by the amazing Kana Hanazawa, mind you); Atomu, the assistant and member-at-large; and Sayuki, who basically checks over everything and takes care of everything else. 
 
Girls Beyond the Wasteland is a show that takes a slice-of-life approach. What I mean by this is that most of it (emphasis on most) occurs on an episodic basis. Whenever you want to incorporate a slice-of-life approach, you need to balance it out with something else because you are basically forsaking a definitive story that would otherwise unite the entire plot together. Whether it’s pure humor (e.g. Hanayamata, The Daily Lives of High School Boys, etc.) or a colorful cast of characters that mesh well with each other (e.g. Love Live!, K-On!, etc.), something needs to occur to captivate the audience somehow. 
 
And that’s the numero uno problem with this show: there is nothing captivating. At all. Nothing. There is some humor, but it is sporadically placed throughout the show in a poorly integrated fashion. As for the characters themselves, well they are mostly archetypal, one-dimensional, clichéd, and with no development. But I’ll give the show this: there definitely was some potential for development. However, it did not flesh out this opportunity well. Some characters are the stars of their own episode (e.g. Andou, Yuuka, Buntarou, Yuuki, etc.) but literally nothing happened. Awfully formulaic too, since it usually boiled down to this: 
 
- A conflict occurs, either internally or with someone else 
- Some lame resolution is reached 
- Move onto the next episode and (usually) pretend like that was it and nothing happened 
 
Fortunately, towards the end of the show, whoever wrote this show does break away from this dry formula. A slight improvement, yes, but this also presents its own set of flaws. For example, Sayuki’s brother – someone who was never mentioned in the show until two episodes before his actual appearance – is forced into the plot because, you know, the plot needs to move along somehow. Same goes for the other competitive game-making group that wants to acquire members from Buntarou’s group. It’s something that does not build off on anything in the show. Aside from that, other aspects of the plot is also pretty clichéd. Obligatory fanservice episode with no meaning? Don’t worry, it’s there alright! 
 
If you’re worried about the pacing, it is actually alright for the most part since the story is presented episodically. The only issue with it is with the first episode, where basically getting every character to join the group is crammed into an incoherent 24 minutes. Because of this, you may end up questioning why some of them decided to join the group. 
 
As for the art, it’s very mediocre. There are some minor shading inconsistencies and the characters themselves seem to almost never change facial expressions. Sound-wise, the voice acting was done well and the music was alright, but I didn’t find it too remarkable. 
 
All in all, a dry cast of characters and a formulaic plot is never a good combination. There were times when the show could have built off the potential it had, but it blew every chance that it was given. I wouldn’t recommend watching this unless you were so bored that you have nothing to do. Then go ahead. 
 
P.S. Did you pick up on the references to other shows? (cough Saekano cough) 
 
Overall: D+ 
 
Author's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis.  
 
It should also be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.

    This is not a good anime, I do not think the parent story is actually good but it's quite entertaining and is what it stated on the first episode, an underdog story.  
 
This has no clear focus, despite 12 episodes, i can't tell u anything about the ""main protagonist"" I take that word lightly beside the stuff in the 1st season of the parent story even then they barely had further growth.  We do not know the characters weaknesses, strengths, them acting like a team, they do not feel like friends just associates. I do not know about the light novel but this is straight up trash character and story wise. 
 
Art itself not bad, but nothing great, It had some decent art design and some fair sound design.  
 
just watch the parent story, this does not do anything to improve or expand the source material. Also has no of the most pathetic characters I know fucken Lefiya the voice actresses I got no idea who told her to what she did, also such a crap script. The fact this got 7.1 is embarrassing and shows how half these people cannot judge a show, but just see pretty images and design animated sequence and consider it 7/10.  
 
My overall grading is 4/10, whereas my enjoyment 3/10. I did not think Bell is a well-written character but after watching these u basically beg for him to come back.

    Moyashimon sports a basic but acceptable animation budget, and for the most part it handles itself just fine. The character designs could almost be called generic, but this is one of those rare cases where color choices make all the difference. The colors are toned down, almost a bit dirty-looking--perfect for an anime set at an agriculture university--but the character designs are still very easy on the eyes. Other than that, the animation is consistently fine, holding together when it needs to be serious and reserving its shortcuts for the sillier moments when they can be used well. Then there are the microbe designs, which are kept simple, cute and marketable. It doesn't look great, but there's an earthy charm to it, and that's nice to see. 
 
Rather than the usual bouncy music I normally associate with slice-of-life, Moyashimon's soundtrack is a little more eclectic. It can get a little repetitive, but between the few pieces they have to work with I think it manages to span the show's various tones and scenarios quite well, ranging from folksy-sounding traditional Japanese music to a more modern-sounding triumphant anthem. College is a time for experiencing variety, and I think that's what they were going for. I have no complaints. 
 
When it comes to voice acting, the lack of an English dub means Japanese is your only option. Voice work and delivery are, of course, paramount in any comedy worth its frames, and that goes double if it's in a language you don't speak. Thankfully, the seiyuu cast here can belt out their lines with hilarious conviction. Of particular note are Tomomichi Nishimura, whose take on Dr. Itsuki is always a joy to listen to, and the talented Daisuke Sakaguchi, whose natural snark makes Sawaki's character a lot more fun. 
 
I cited this show back in my Tatami Galaxy review as one of the few anime that addresses college life, and if nothing else it's laudable for that (as a quick aside I'll mention that Moyashimon, Honey & Clover and The Tatami Galaxy were all noitaminA shows, make of that what you will). This series is quieter, humbler and simpler than its younger cousin, but it still gives a well fleshed-out look at college life and the plethora of experiences that come with it. Like The Tatami Galaxy, Moyashimon downplays the academic side of college to focus more on the element of self-discovery, and it makes for a nice breath of fresh air without coming across as escapist fluff. 
 
First and foremost, Moyashimon is a comedy. A few of the jokes in this show are a little too understated to have any punch, but for the most part the humor walks a fine line between down-to-earth near-believability and glorious bombast that makes it a delight. The art style is simple enough that it works well for their visual gags, the setting is distinctive enough to set up some scenarios you've never seen in an anime before, and the characters are fun and genuine enough that they're easy to get behind even and especially when they're being complete buffoons. Dr. Itsuki in particular takes his passion for biological sciences to delightful extremes, and the cartoonish microbes themselves can take simple science lessons and make them a helluva lot more fun. 
 
Speaking of science lessons, the chemistry and biology in this show are well-researched, as are the elements of farming and business, so if you happen to enjoy getting a little trivia out of your entertainment they're a tasty treat on the side. If that doesn't interest you it might be a bit much to sit through, but they're generally kept brief, simple and funny. Even if you don't understand all the science and business talk, it shouldn't make the show as a whole any harder to follow. 
 
If there's one thing that really elevates Moyashimon, though, it's the characters. Dr. Itsuki isn't just a fun guy to watch, he's also a surprisingly insightful mentor and the guidance he gives his students may turn out to be more helpful than they realize. An upperclassman named Mutou is still recovering from a breakup when that relationship had more or less defined her direction in life. Kawahama and Misato, a duo of upperclassmen who initially seem like comic relief buffons only interested in money and sake, end up showing a surprising level of maturity and supporting Sawaki when he needs it most, and Sawaki's best friend Kei goes through an arc I dare not spoil; suffice it to say it's an issue rarely touched upon by anime. If there's one recurring theme throughout Moyashimon, it's that you need to find your own path and determine your own future, and college is the perfect time to discover just what that future might be, and Dr. Itsuki's assistant Haruka Hasegawa stands out as a particularly poignant example of this, though again I won't spoil why. 
 
Sawaki himself is a bit of a missed opportunity, unfortunately. There are hints at the beginning of the series that he used to really love seeing the microbes, and they bring that ""forgotten passion"" aspect of his character back for a heartwarming season finale while also raising the question of whether he has any worth outside his ability to see microbes, but between episode 2 and episode 11 what you see is mostly him being the straight man to all the weirdness that goes on around him. Does that make him unlikable? No, he's still a perfectly pleasant human being, if a bit weak-willed and easy to string along. I just don't think he should've been the straight man, that role exists primarily to play off of others and Sawaki could've been a much more fascinating character all on his own. There were still some nice little moments here and there, so I can't be too mad about it. 
 
I'll quickly mention that second season of the show does exist, and while I don't consider it to be as good as the first season it is still more of a good thing, same great characters and all, so if you enjoy the first season, I shouldn't have to tell you to give the second a chance. I may end up giving that season its own review eventually, though I can't say when. I do hope that if there's ever a third season it'll set things back on the right track. The source material is still ongoing, so it's definitely possible. 
 
Moyashimon is simple but effective look at college as a time to learn about yourself and find direction in life. It's not as complex or ambitious as The Tatami Galaxy, but its cast lovable and relatable characters more than make up for that. It's always charming and never boring. Give this show a chance and see if it strikes any chemistry with you.

    Oh, Shimoneta. 
They actually had some of the most funniest self censor-ship (Since KissxSis), a great complex MC, lovely animation eye candy, and an amazingly epic, yet oh-so pathetic villain. 
Yes, White Peak. 
You can already tell by his name, he's epic. 
You don't even have to watch the anime, you'll just know right away. 
 
They completely un-censored... er... 'Love Nectar'. 
Which is great... cuz... 
I'm too lazy to look up hentai of Anna's fluids coming out of her. 
You're probably wondering to yourself, what kind of lazy asshole lwouldn't even simply search hentai of Anna. 
Well. 
I guess I am that special kind of asshole. 
Er... 
Anyway, I personally think it᤾'s also quite lovely that there is panties all over the place, and that there are actual reasons they actually show up other than fanservice. 
Most of our heroines wear clean white panties on their faces (THANKFULLY THEY ARE CLEAN), White peak just wears dirty panties all over his body, and Gathered Fabric followers normally wear panties on there face. 
Baiscally almost everyone in the anime wears panties on there face. 
I might actually try that putting a few pairs on my face. 
Heehee. 
 
I love how the MC actually goes through love interest development. 
It's usually rare for me to see some, especially in light-heart comedy animes like this. 
It's also quite hillarious on how he managed to get raped while Ayame and Otome and watched. (Spolier?) 
Of course those twocouldn't do anything. 
They also HAD TO a have an literal dick-head loli. A few naked fights, and a few dick slaps. 
Also there is an episode clearly instructing how to make homemade fapper mcjackers and lube (GREAT LUBE) 
Watch the anime, god damnit. I'm not telling you the episode. 
What more do I need? 
Oh, yeah... 
A second season. 
A second season is all that I need in my already miserable life. 
The anime already gave me such an unusual source of enjoyment that I rarely get. 
I just want another season to staisfy my needs, y'know? 
 
10 out of motherfucking 10  
Great lube and yummy vaginal fluid cookies. 
Oh, and nice laugh, Blue Snow. 
Ohohoho.

    This is an often overlooked anime when looking at different anime by Shaft. It's a great example of how care-free you can feel while watching anime. This particular anime is very soothing itself, and should not be overlooked as much as it is. 
 
Story: (6/10) 
Nothing too special in and of itself. There are two plot-lines you follow. One is Erio trying to become more of a normal girl after living (what seems to be the majority of her life) in a futon, not doing anything. The other is of Makoto trying to get used to his new life in a new house, living with his aunt and Erio, and attending a new school. It's charming to see it progress, but it never has you wanting to know what happens next very badly. Take it as it comes. 
 
Art: (10/10) 
Shaft's addiction to turning heads shows up once more, but this time, even more beautiful. Everything is bright, happy, and shiny. Never a dull moment with the art, and the animators don't get lazy. 
 
Sound: (7/10) 
Alone, the soundtrack is plain, but it is used well in the series. It is silent when it needs to be, and can cause perfect feelings of awkwardness. The voice acting was overall decent, nothing to sneer at. 
 
Characters: (7/10) 
Erio is the most developed character and you grow to like her. The other characters are either cute, funny, or Makoto. He does not develop much, yet his personality makes up for it (mostly). Someone as strange as Erio needs a cynical friend such as Makoto to make moments even more light-hearted and funny. 
 
Enjoyment: (8/10) 
It was a nice, quick anime. I enjoyed all the goofiness, the cuteness, and the beautiful art similar to 5 Cm Per Second (even a quick reference if you can find it). Nothing I would go and buy, but it kept me happy and entertained for a good while. 
 
Overall: (8/10) 
If you have not seen it yet, I recommend that you do. If you want something light-hearted and visually appealing, this is a great one to go for. Not at all a waste of my time.

    Well. First, don't be fooled by cutesy graphics. Despite featuring children, this anime contains some of the most disturbing scenes I ever seen in anywhere in any anime. There aren't a lot of those, but they're here. Bad things happen. When they do happen, the anime doesn't pull punches. So, this is not kid's friendly stuff. 
 
This is a high quality anime that... that, unfortunately, did not click with me, and I did not enjoy it much.  
 
I'll try to break it down below. 
 
Story: 6/10: 
 
There's a hole in the ground called abyss. Nobody knows how deep it goes, but there's a city built around it, full of people who descend into it hunting for relics. The abyss strange, and contains creatures unlike anything on earth. It is also cursed... if you go too far down, you may not be able to return. The anime tells story of two of some characters that decided to venture down. 
 
I found the lore and creatures interesting. However, the atmosphere of the setting didn't really click with me - it is a ""journey"" anime, and it spends most of the time portraying dangerous and alien world of the abyss. For me the setting looked a bit nice, but if you started digging deeper you'd probably hit a ton of plot holes.  
 
Then again... it is constructed like some sort of fairy tale/journey. Except htat's one hell of a dark fairy tale. 
 
Art: 6/10: 
Very high quality backgrounds, however, main characters are pretty much chibis and have small amount of details on their faces. Side characters are well detailed, I'm just not sure why the author decided to utilize chibi protagonists. 
 
Sound: 6/10: 
The music was nice, although It didn't ""stick"" with me. 
 
Characters: 5/10: 
In all honesty, there isn't much to tell about them. They play their respective roles. Some of the side stories explaining this or that character are well done... but when I watched it they resembled more of a plot devices than actual people. Not sure if it makes sense or not. Basicaly, it is the same thing as with the story - as long as you don't dig too deep, they work. 
 
Enjoyment: 5/10: 
Can't say I enjoyed it. Few of the dark moments that came out of the blue, hit home, but I can't say that I fully appreciated them. It is basically not exactly clear what the anime is trying to be - a tale about travel/journey, a story to horrify viewer, or a bit of all of that. There are well done moments, and art/visual is good ... but as I said, it didn't click with me. 
 
Overall: 6/10: 
It is worth checking out due to high production values. However, be aware that the story goes seriously dark at some location, and don't be fooled by cutesy graphics. 
 
And that's all I can say about it.

    Overlord... The most boring time-wasting obnoxious anime ever made (or one of them at least)  
 
I don't know how many people can rate this anime above 4... The story is pretty much nonexistent, the characters are way less interesting than a rock, no personality whatsoever, OP mc done wrong, useless mmo setting, low budget trash...  
 
I can watch a rock for 5 hours and still be more entertained by that than by watching this trash...  
 
Momonga is basically a worse version of kirito, as 'op' as kirito is he still needs some help from other people... But momonga? Lets one fucking shot these mobs that no one even care about to save this village that again no one cares about...  
 
And the sides characters u ask? They all just a bunch of disney characters talking about momonga in literally every conversation they have and have 0 personality whatsoever...  
 
The animation is bad, its stiff, its low budget 
 
The story in general is basically momonga sitting in his castle, sometimes going out to one shot some mobs and going back to his castle...basically NOTHING HAPPENS FOR 8 EPS (8 eps is my limit, i cant take this bullshit anymore), NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, NO STORY PROGRESSION, NO ANY SORT OF INTERESTING THING HAPPENS... 
 
Overlord is basically the poor man's 'How NOT to summon a demon lord' 
 
Things NOT to do when you make an anime centered around an op main character:  
1.Make the op character boring  
2.Make the side characters feel like cardboards  
3.Have 0 story  
4.Make the atmosphere and world in general liveless  
5.Have 0 character development or any interesting thing 8 eps in  
 
Overlord checked all of those points 
 
Unlike 'How NOT to summon a demon lord' which actually have an mc that feels like a character, side characters that are actually quite relatable and pretty important to the point where u actually care about them, Have an interesting story with a lively atmosphere, and a character development to top it off... And it gets a 7.30 overall score on MAL while this trash gets 8.07 because the main character is so edgy and ""cool"" and is a skeleton king wow look mom so cool (i wanna puke real bad)... 
 
Overlord is basically mars of destruction but with a slightly more budget on the artwork and animation department

    K-On! is by no means an anime for everybody. One can not go into K-On! expecting an intricate story, or deep character development. It is a slice-of-life anime without a season or series long plot, in fact, almost every episode has a different plot (Although, some of them are very similar).  
 
K-On! is very cute. That is probably the first thing everyone will notice about it, and many will be put off by this fact, however after watching a few episodes, I couldn't help but laugh at the silly, childish, and cute humor this series is filled with. 
Some of the humor is recycled (Mostly in this season), and after a while, it will lose its value, but they managed to keep me laughing at least once an episode all the way through.  
 
For most of the series, there is no deep character development. By this, I mean that what you see in the first few episodes, is what you get.  
Yui is hyper, and childish, but cute in her own right. 
Tsumugi is generally quiet, and appears graceful, but often proves to be just as childish as Yui. 
Mio is the most mature of the initial four main characters, but her own shadow would scare her to the point of defecation (Which you'd better get used to, as it is probably the most recycled joke in the first season).  
and finally, Ritsu, who is much like Yui, except much less memorable. She also plays the drums. Ritsu is generally the least liked of the main cast, because there's really nothing unique about her aside from her tomboy-ish style.  
 
 
K-On! is well worth watching, and I would recommend everyone to continue to K-On!!(S2)  even if you didn't like the first season. K-On!! fixes many of the problems that existed in the first season. 
 
In conclusion, K-On! is one of my favorite series of all time (Anime or otherwise), and near the end of the series, it pulled my heartstrings in a way I never thought an animated show could.  
 
If you haven't watched K-On!, do it. Now. Why are you still reading this?

    Warning: May contain spoilers(actually it does) 
 
Ouran Koukou Host Club on one of the best reverse Harem I've seen so far. The story is nothing special really, but as for the art, character development and comedy, it was everything an anime should have. Even if you're not a fan of romantic comedy this should be a good experience for you, cause there's much more to it than that and I'm yet to find a second like it. 
 
The main character is Haruhi Fujioka, an extremely smart and equally blunt and dense scholar who gets into Ouran High School, an elite academy for the super rich(you better believe it) and beautiful(not always, better believe this too). On her first day there her life takes a turn that she couldn't possibly predict and she ends up working at the host club. A place with charming boys with way too much time on their hands entertain young ladies with no purpose in life that isn't fulfilled already. 
|spoiler!!!|Get's mistaken for a guy, but they eventually find out 
The host club is where she meets Tamaki, the one who has a crush on her and lovers her as his own daughter(don't ask); the Hitachiin twins(I can't quite find the words to describe them); then there's Honey-senpai a 4'9"" boy Lolita character who's physical strength that defies laws of physics as does any Japanese game developers; then there's Mori-senpai who's just there 0_0 well, moving on! Last but not least comes Kyouya the one who fits the requirements to be you want to be, and therefore you may or may not start hating him, but somehow he'll end up in your reverse harem list....

    Rokka no Yuusha was quite a enjoyable anime to watch each episode kept me on edge. There are a lot of twist and turns that go on through out the story that will send you in circles. The characters are also interesting they help to keep the story exciting, the action scenes are well done you will see a lot o f tactics which is what I like to see instead of the usual mindless charge at your enemy kind of thing. I strongly recommend this anime to anybody whether you are casual anime watcher or a hardcore one.

    Another is quite the horror anime. It spends episode after episode weaving in an intricate story, which often leaves you in suspense. Out of all of the aspects of this anime, I believe it executed (no pun intended) the atmosphere the best. Even by the first episode, I was on the edge of my seat, feeling off because of the eerie atmosphere this show gives off. Separately from the show, I would not listen to the soundtrack on a daily basis. Even so, while watching, it is the perfect background music, giving off a vibe of suspense and horror. Even if nothing is scary onscreen, you will still be given the creeps. Now, this show was not the perfect horror anime. The character development wasn't noticeable, and the animation wasn't amazing. Even so, I think this show would be good to watch on a rainy day or a weekend.

    Back when I first started Hinamatsuri in the midst of other shows for the Spring season Hinamatsuri felt different. Compared to the others, it pulled me in and in a different way too. In the first five minutes I was slightly taken aback by the artstyle but when I continued watching it, it hit me with it's wonder. Hinamatsuri is exactly that kind of anime, and it continued to be so till it's end, it calms you down, then immediately rushes out with the comedy and before you know it, you're laughing out loud. Oh and there are tons of heartfelt moments too, what more could you ask for such an innovative and hilarious anime? Original Review published June 22, 2018 on MAL 
 
For starters, Hinamatsuri is a fresh take among the many comedy anime we see nowadays. It's not a school romance comedy and thanks to that it pushes out a huge cliche (there are exceptions) right out of the window, add to that it's supernatural nature mixed with clever comedy and you've got a fresh anime that people not only laugh with, but cherish for the coming seasons because you won't see such an anime so common, not every season, not every year either. Hinamatsuri uses tons of elements and jokes in it's run and it was very hard for me to find recycled jokes among them, it was all new and innovative and that says a lot about it's quality as a comedy anime. Oh and by saying it's supernatural you might think it relies too much on supernatural stupidity to tickle your funny bone? No, the best part is that Hinamatsuri can stand even on normal comedy and make everyday situations so hilarious despite having a huge arsenal of supernatural jokes at its disposal but Hinamatsuri uses both of them very wisely with the end result being us viewers holding down our stomachs while we laugh.  
 
A huge reason why Hinamatsuri is so incredibly amazing is because it's got various approaches to the comedy, and it almost always nailed them, first off it has a buildup of jokes, the situation starts getting crazier and crazier and you're left laughing at every second. This is common in comedy anime since you can put up over the top situations and make people laugh as well, but Hinamatsuri unlike many others not only looks at that but it also looks at the premise where it's using it in, something surprisingly uncommon in other anime. What am I talking about? Many times we see anime attempt at comedy but use the wrong approach at the wrong time, thus even though the joke was actually funny, the wrong approach didn't give the writers the result they wanted and this anime thankfully crosses that hurdle.  
 
Another approach it has to it's comedy is somewhat of the opposite, it sets your expectations low on purpose before hitting you with the punchline, this also has a largely positive effect since if the joke is successful, it can almost equal the hilarity of the previous take and on the other hand serve as an element of surprise to its viewers which as well plays a huge part in making it so funny since Hinamatsuri rarely failed at this as well. Yet another approach Hinamatsuri took was to use the “straight man” principle to effectively. What is the straight man principle you may ask? It's when the characters do something stupid and another character takes the “straight man” role and points out the stupidity in shock and while on paper this may seem unfunny, in reality it's very successful if implemented properly, two of the best and most famous examples of characters using the straight man principle excellently in anime are namely Saiki Kusuo (Saiki Kusuo no PSI Nan) and Shimura Shinpachi (Gintama). Instead of attributing this principle to only one character, Hinamatsuri gives the role to multiple characters depending on the situation and thankfully does it well.  
 
Why did I list these and explain the different approaches to comedy? It's because few anime use so many approaches and few of them are successful in doing so as well, and the good news is that Hinamatsuri can use those very well, reason being it keeps them fresh with the comedy and helps keep things varied.  
 
Note: The following is a comparison of Hinamatsuri, Saiki and Gintama, if you haven't watched the latter two completely, please skip the next paragraph as you may not understand the references talked about.  
 
***COMPARISON BEGIN: Since comedy shows get compared a lot, why not compare Hinamatsuri with an anime it shares a lot in common with arguably the giant of comedy anime, Gintama along with a relatively recent anime that's also been doing fabulous, Saiki Kusuo, note that I used these both as examples as well above for the straight man principle. First off with Gintama, Hinamatsuri shares the nature of smile+tears, meaning that both anime make you laugh with it's jokes, but it also has it's sad arcs that give you the feels and usually make many cry. Apart from this, both are supernatural anime (along with Saiki of course) that use their premise very smartly and have varied approaches to comedy, not just one. For Saiki, both feature modern-day Earth but retain the supernatural nature along with the occasional school comedy (but good) thrown in. COMPARISON END*** 
 
All three feature this element and excellently use their numerous weapons at their disposal wisely along with using one of the best comedy methods as well, unpredictability. You never know what comes next and when it does, you're left laughing your ass out. What does this entail? This entails that Hinamatsuri is an anime comparable to such greats and can stand on its own as well without having to mooch off anything else. Much like the other two, Hinamatsuri also at times jumped straight to the comedy itself without any caution (although this wasn't used much) and served as possibly the best form of surprise it could muster. Moving away from the comparing and looking at the points that set Hinamatsuri apart from the others is that Hinamatsuri uses an outsmarting “lazy approach”, such that when you're watching Hinamatsuri, much like Hina, it looks sluggish and slow and lazy as well but the moment you think that this is how the whole episode will be, it lands in a sudden joke and you're left flabbergasted in laughter (can people be flabbergasted in laughter? Maybe :P) so you'd be dumb to write Hinamatsuri off if you think it's a bit slow at first because there's a huge punch coming really soon as well.  
 
Now let's step aside from the comedy for a bit since that's not exactly everything Hinamatsuri offers, we also have the occasional sad arcs. These were usually of Anzu (primarily) and at times a few other characters realising the importance of friendship or a life lesson as well. The reason why people loved Anzu to the point that people very soon ranked her higher than Hina for the best girl of the anime was because her arcs were so damn powerful. Poverty, learning to live as a homeless person, the community you make with them, and many other things beyond that I can't cover since they're spoilers, her arcs have a lot of thought and emotion into them and no person with a heart could not at least get a lump in their throat when they see the way she works hard to do her best for her friends who she treats like family as the feeling is mutual, this is really what should make us smile and laugh, the happiness of a human being doesn't come from being rich, but from enjoying what's next to us, what we have, not what we want, and this serious message was shown through her in these arcs. Getting why the anime is so amazing?  
 
On the other side of the spectrum we have the duo who we started with, Nitta and Hina, these two are like father and daughter, despite one being a Yakuza and the other having dangerous superpowers, they went like bread and butter, and for the opposite reasons. If you took them individually, Hina wouldn't be as funny by herself and Nitta could only be used as a straight man if he's not with Hina. The anime is such that not only can Hina and Nitta not live without each other, but their comedy as well can't live without each other, and this is a testament to the genius mangaka behind this. As such, this erases most doubts about people possibly thinking of possibly axing one of the two, but much like Nana and Popo in the Ice Climbers (I s'pose no one will get that NES reference), they both need each other not only to live, but to make us laugh. Needless to say, Hina and Nitta’s sketches leave their mark clearly.  
 
Let's move to arguably the most powerful character of the show, Hitomi. Why did I call her so? It's because she highly influences both Hina and Anzu. Anyway, Hitomi is fantastic as a character since she's very relatable thanks to her being given the straight man (or woman if you may) role by handling the BS that her daily life gives her and her arcs as well were hilarious as well as cute. She suddenly gets forced to work as a bartender and surprisingly becomes adept at her job and this is used as a baseline for many of the jokes at her. She also as mentioned played the straight woman for the crap that she has to deal with Hina and sometimes Anzu and her work. The best part is that she's amazing since she's so ordinary in the midst of idiots around her that it's hilarious in its own right and I seriously can't complain when even this is used well for it's jokes. Pretty reflective of the anime itself.  
 
The thing is that Hinamatsuri has its own share of flaws as well. Even though it's comedy is almost always on point, if the jokes DO fail, the episode can fall apart pretty quick if nothing is done, and although this did happen once or twice, it pretty much saved itself in the next joke and went on, but this issue does exist and could be done better. And one issue that many point out is that since the anime is named Hinamatsuri, it still doesn't focus much on Hina in the first place. Although Hinamatsuri's purpose is to follow and balance screen time for all characters, many times Hina felt off the mark either because she wasn't given too many lines or she wasn't the person making the joke at that time. This is also a problem since based on Hina’s character, it's hard to bring in new stuff for a lazy brat since a lazy brat doesn't do much in the first place. This shows that you can't do much with the character as you would with others so Hinamatsuri's comedy gets held back at times when Hina doesn't do much.  
 
Overall, Hinamatsuri is an anime that does a lot, and a lot of that is different from the usual. Apart from being able to stand on its own legs for support, it is comparable to the legends in its genre and can hold its own to a respectable level. It's truly an all round comedy in part because it makes you cry then laugh in just a span of a minute. Why is that you may ask? It's because comedy isn't just laughing at stupidity, comedy is also trying to find the funny in tragedy and the sad times, that's what Hinamatsuri is all about. And that's what comedy should be all about isn't it? 
 
P.S: This season has a multitude of amazing last episodes demonstrating the best of the show’s offerings overall and Hinamatsuri was no exception. The last episode excellently showed us everything that made the show so amazing. A combination of feels, slapstick comedy and recent nostalgia made for an epic end to an epic anime (despite that minor cliffhanger?), and as a fan, I couldn't ask for anything more. It's a fan’s dream come true. Here's hoping we see a season 2 anytime soon!

    Shikabane Hime&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t going to do this one either&hellip; seemed a bit too generic. But I bit the bullet and watched it anyway. It wasn&rsquo;t good. It wasn&rsquo;t bad. It was just&hellip; decent. I&rsquo;ll probably watch the next episode to decide if I keep it on my roster for the season. Production values were all right. The OP isn&rsquo;t really memorable, and neither is the ED. The general BGM throughout the show is okay, but isn&rsquo;t really memorable either. It&rsquo;s kind of a shame that music isn&rsquo;t memorable at all in this show. I thought it could really have potential, considering the premise of the show is somewhat Bleach like, and Bleach had great music. The animation was all right as well&hellip; a bit jumpy in some spots, but generally fluid. The character art was decent, and semi-consistent, though I say that their noses are far too large for anime. Its just kind of a shame that nothing really stands out as spectacular in this anime. I suppose I should give it time to see if it blossoms, but my cynicism won&rsquo;t let be get my hopes up. 
 
The premise of the show is very Bleach like, which is not to say that it&rsquo;s a knock off of Bleach, but they are very similar. Spiritually sensitive kid lives in a temple, and sees spirits. He has three friends that have anime stereotype personalities (Rukia is the only good female main character in Bleach, god dammit!). He stumbles upon the main female character Makina, who is a shikabane hime (someone who hunts shikabane, I&rsquo;m guessing) and he is startled that she&rsquo;s dead. He has a trippy run in with a spirit cat that tells him things, but eventually he shrugs it off. Yagami, the male lead, moves out after this incident. It turns out that Yagami&rsquo;s aniki Keisei is the head of this secret society that hunts shikabane. Shikabane are corpses that have enough will to keep moving after death, and its Makina&rsquo;s job to hunt them. I&rsquo;m guessing that Keisei loves Makina or something, because they make it pretty damn obvious when you compare his attitude towards her to the other members of the society. Well, nothing really happens for most of the first episode, then at the end, Makina kicks ass with sub-machine guns and takes out the shikabane for the episode. 
 
We can all guess that soon, Yagami will delve into all of this business, as he has met Makina. He saves her from being permanently dead (which had a trippy mind-fuck sequence) and then she slaps him and books it. I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed in the first episode. It had real potential to be memorable, but it just didn&rsquo;t wow me. Check it out if you want. I&rsquo;ll probably watch the next episode before deciding anything. I give the show a total 6/10. I should note that this show is already slotted for a sequel, even before the first episode aired. It better turn out damn good, or I get to get out the pimp hand.

    Upon reading the synopsis I was a little intrigued, but I was a little mislead in what this story was. I thought it would be some little romantic comedy of sort, but I never expected it to be such an enjoyable story. It is one of those series that is so unique yet so stereotypical that it comes out of left field and hits you in a good way. I would say that this is a must see, and do not delay like I did. It is not what you expect it to be, it is so much more. 
 
The story starts out as the synopsis says, but let me expand on the first minute or two that they told you about. A Japanese girl visits America and is in front of the White House. A naked guy appears holding a cell phone in one hand and a gun in the other. He has had his memory erased. He sort of saves the girl, and the girl gives him a couple items of her clothing (jacket, scarf.. but oddly his ""johnny"" is still hanging out). The guy runs off but her wallet is in the jacket. Now you know the first five minutes of this story. From there it involves their relationship, the mystery of why his memory was erased, and what the heck is going on with this crazy phone of his. He's involved in some sort of crazy game where a few individuals have billions of dollars and with one phone call can have whatever they want to happen... happen. There's the story with no spoilers.  
 
It's eleven episodes of mystery and mayhem, but it's done in such a wonderful way. There is a love story in there, but this isn't about the love story. The main character is so charming and charismatic that even with no memories he wings his way through his odd situation. The supporting characters are all interesting in their own ways as well. The story and characters are all well developed, and it gives just enough without over explaining or over exposing things that it shouldn't. Even the music played a great part in the story. 
 
If you like interesting stories with a few twists here and there then you should definitely check this out. It's not a chick flick. It's not a fan service anime series either. It's a well made, brilliant at times, but well told story that anybody can enjoy. Unfortunately the ending is left open, but they do announce that 2 movies will follow. I will be checking out these movies but this review is just for the 11 episode anime series. 
 
This i s a must watch. Don't hesitate.

    Although a slighty confusing and very philosophical story, it flows very well and comes together seamlessly in the end. The animation was beautiful, fluid and lifelike. The CG blended well and made each frame stand out. An awesome soundtrack that set the mood very well. There was gradual character development but it just seemed to fill in where the first movie left off. Overall a very good anime but not a very accessible one. The story was very cryptic at times with a very serious undertone that require concentration. Not as much action but what it lacks makes up in atmosphere and detail. Watch if you feel up for a strongly scripted movie which may leave you pondering the many issues it brings up.

    Fortunately, you will be able to watch other romance animes besides that one. Really, it's almost a good thing to be able to fully appreciate the nothingness and the emptiness of these episodes sandwiched together and called, beyond my comprehension, an anime : because if you're being able to enjoy that one, then believe me, every other animes with similar theme will transport you WAY farther. 
 
Along the lines, and with the very first episodes at that,you will first notice the total absence of a scenario. Kaichou wa Maid-sama is not a story, it's a setting. And that's it. It could have been not that bad if this setting was explored at least thoroughly ... but forget it : with old jokes, inconsistent scenes, confusing dialogues, that was not going to happen. 
 
With that, you could expect tremendous cute characters drawings and art, yes ?  
Sorry, not happening either. The authors must have spend a far amount of time away, on a desert island, watching each other faces on a close-up and have selfishly decided it was good enough to put this exercise into an anime. Prepare yourself : 
It's not that bad, but still your eyes could get hurted along the way. 
... 
Since I don't want to give up more time to this anime than I already have, I will wrap things here and now and tell you this : 
If you are a veteran anime fan, or if you have already watched a few romance anime, stay far away from this one. It's not that the anime is actually so bad, and if i could describe it more accurately, I would dare to say it's kind of ""pointless"". You're going to end up, midway, totally indifferent to the setting, the characters, the story (ouch! the word hits me !) etc ... 
If you're new to the romance anime theme, don't give up. Sure, this one lacks a bit of the warm, strong and lovely feelings you could find in others, but perhaps it's still watchable as it could satisfy you in its own pace...

    I love Plastic Memories. It's the first anime I've ever watched and it made me cry (okay, okay, I admit; I was sobbing my eyes out). And I don't cry. Ever. 
 
Some people don't like Plastic Memories, but I can't understand why. 
The story is about this boy, Tsukasa, who starts working with Giftias (basically robots) and starts developing feelings for his colleague, Isla, a Giftia. However, Giftias only live for 9 years and a few months. And Isla's time is almost up. 
 
In my opinion, this story is well-thought-out and beautiful, with a lot of feelings. The other characters all had a backstory too, so they weren't shallow (or at least not to me). 
 
I really enjoyed watching this anime and... it actually made me think of life. Some things just don't last forever and you shouldn't waste your time trying to hold onto them. Instead you should embrace it and make the best out of it.

    ""Roses are red, 
 Minori is a g, 
 Don't watch Toradora, 
 It sucks pp."" 
                    - yxckson 
 
          What can I say, I had unbelievably high hopes for Toradora and it ended up being the biggest chore to watch. This ain't just gonna be a review my guy, this is gonna be a whole ass rant, so clench your butt-cheeks and prepare for this absolute clusterf*** of a show. 
 
 
PLOT (Simplified like a mf): 
 
          Toradora bout Taiga and Ryuuji. They have crushes on the others best friend, so they try to set the other up wit they best friend yadda yadda-- who gives a sh*t. Sounds cool right? Next. 
 
 
EPISODES 1-10: 
 
          Toradora was everything I thought it was gonna be and more during the first 10 or so episodes. It was funny, entertaining, had intriguing and enjoyable characters (Taiga being my favorite, Ryuuji close 2nd). I thoroughly enjoyed the hell out of all of this. I was telling my friends, family, and probably your uncle bout this show. My only wish was that Taiga and Ryuuji would have at least more than just like one good moment wit each other and thas it. How could you mess this sh*t up? - (9/10) 
 
 
EPISODES 11-25: 
 
          They messed all the sh*t up. - (3/10) 
 
 
PROBLEM #1:  PLOTHOLES 
 
          No one really seems to point this out, but WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THIS HORRENDOUS WRITING? The story can be described as some idiot with broken arms and legs on 10 foot stilts on the edge of the Grand Canyon. I won't (try to) spoil anything in this review, but there is a couple of parts in the 2nd half of the show that just flat out make zero sense, so I'll try to explain major-spoiler-free. Stuff like introducing characters and placing them into an important role in the story, then the next second forgetting them completely, to saying a certain important character is moving and then it doesn't happen, until it happens at that worse, most inconvenient, confusing part of the show. And people are praising this show for it's excellent writing? Yeah, miss me wit that BULLSH*T chief. 
 
 
PROBLEM #2:  PACING 
 
          AUGGGGGGGHHHHHHH, arguably the most important thing to keeping a show entertaining: good pacing. When do we learn? When do we learn to not mess this up? Like man, how do you even compare the pacing to something? Hmmmm... lemme try putting it this way: 
 
          The pacing is slower than Shaq running. Yeah, I said it, and if you don't know how slow that is, let's say a damn turtle is about as fast as Shaq running. 
 
          When the show goes from a great comedy with a excellent premise to a absolute disaster of a melodrama, the pacing takes a swan dive off Mt. Everest into the Earth's core. Nothing else to add to that, just thinking about the pacing buts a bad taste in my mouth. 
 
 
PROBLEM #3:  SUDDEN TONE SHIFT 
 
          Remember like 10 seconds ago when I was talking about the sudden switch to comedy to melodrama? Yeah, that's a big problem. 
 
          It's not easy to describe the tone shift other than just saying it's sudden and makes the show just feel like filler in the 2nd half. It's just bad. I thought everyone knew that sudden changes are 99% of the time not good. 
 
 
PROBLEM #4:  SH*T ENDING 
 
          The ending is the absolute worst part of this show, without a doubt. You know the feeling of working on something with a passion for a long period of time, just to lose it all and have to restart off from scratch? That's how the ending to Toraboring is. Yep, you just watched 20+ episodes just to have it ruined in the last two. 
 
          Wait, there's people that actually like the ending to this show? I get it, like we all have our opinions, and that's fine, but for this? Hell no. These are the people that need their opinion passes taken away (even though I gave SAO an 8 but lets not talk about that). 
 
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
          Bad show. No watch.

    I would never presume to write a review that one could consider to be a calumny of the Chobits brand, but I will admit this review will not be glowing. 
 
Chobits follows the life of Hideki Motosuwa after he chances upon a discarded and beautiful amnesiac of a persecom (human computer, person computer, persecom? Incorrect spelling likely: urge to google = 0) in the trash one unlikely day. He dubs her Chi, as that's the only word she can say, and the pair embark on a slough of high jinks and hilarity, har har hoo ha.  
 
Now, you may initially view this as a perfect set up for an intelligent deconstruction of typical human romance stories along with a creative sci-fi story based in a world rich with lore. What you're going to get in place of that is your nearly standard rom-com slice of life anime wherein a naive girl and a bumbling idiot fall in love in the first episode but dance around each other in a will-they-won't-they tease routine for all the lonely souls out there to enjoy and cuddle over. 
 
Please don't misunderstand: the show has great potential! Especially during the segments when viewers are actually treated to a little of the reasoning behind all the mysterious and spooky techno-bull that's going on. Unfortunately, most of the real plot is literally brushed aside 90% of the time with a ""Oh well, let's chase that shiny over there, tee hee"" from the oblivious and obtuse main characters. Why explain the purpose when you can watch this little pink thing spin in circles and squeak? Trick question - always watch the pink thing. 
 
Most of the slice of life gravy that the directors poured all over their teaspoon of potato is meant to elucidate the main conflict. This creates a problem, as we end up with a show that's attempting to be two clashing genres at once instead of a graceful meld. The reasoning behind the sci-fi ends up being lame because it was set up by the rom-com aspect, and vice versa. Chobits tries to grapple with the definition of humanity while forcing its main characters to hunt for underpants in an oh-so-entertaining 22 minute shenanigan filled episode. 
 
There were times when I enjoyed this show, and there were many more times where I slapped myself on the forehead solely because I enjoyed it. I also slapped myself from cringing too much. Most of the show's charm is eclipsed by its unsuccessful attempt to be two things at once instead of its own thing. However, if you enjoy most Romantic Comedies that you watch, you'll probably find this one is worth checking out.

    If you heard another anime that relates to the word under the same name of an anime (IE: Nichijou), and you went from there to here and hoping that this anime is entertaining like Nichijou. Then, you, my friend, have not to worry. 
 
Funnily enough, Daily Lives of the High School Boys is one of the most fascinating comedy, slice-of-life anime you'll ever find. 
 
And based on the title, it tells the story of three main characters doing crazy s***s and funny stuffs that surrounds them. Not only they revolve at these three MCs, but also the other supporting characters from the all-boys High School, and some other girls. And if that's not enough, there's also the ""High School Girls are Funky"" sequence where it revolves around the other three main characters, all of which are girls, who have to deal around in the same universe. This sequence is shown after you waited (or skip) the ending song. 
 
The plot is purely nonsensical, just like in Nichijou, filled with hilarious slapstick comedy that you can find in this 12-episodic anime series (plus the OVAs). And let me tell you, that even a short comedic skit, it will make you smile or even laugh. They will tickle your funny bone whenever they do something hilarious, intentional or not. 
 
The art is almost the same as Nichijou, except they make it male and... some characters are hideous. 
 
But when it comes to characters, well, it's all done perfectly well for this comedic anime series. And let me tell you, when it comes to comedy, the characters that were performed here are fantastic, no matter where you look at from different perspective. From hilarious one liners to stupid yet ridiculous skits, everyone performed here will just tickle your funny bone. 
 
Both OP and ESPECIALLY the ED is pretty great. But the ED really stands it all out as the ED plus it's video is pretty hilarious and spot on. 
 
Above all else, everything that surrounds this 12-episodic anime is crazy and hilarious as hell. If your looking for something a much more funnier comedy, try this one. Or if you want something that is related to Nichijou, you've come to the right place/anime. Daily lives of High School Boys is, definitely, the one you should try for. It's fun, hilarious, and even though the plot is nonsensical, it will sure make you laugh and keeps you watch this anime in just one, yet rewarding, series.  
 
I hope they made Season 2 for this. Oh! And Nichijou as well...

    As always my reveiw will be short and simple, much like this anime. 
 
Gokicha!! Cockroach Girl! Is very short only 2 episodes at 8 minutes each, it is ""ongoing"" but episodes haven't been released in awhile so this anime might have died out. 
 
The animation is extremely simple and almost made me stop watching, the few action scenes were looped or at least seemed that way, the characters rarely moved their mouths to speak. 
 
I feel the basic idea behind the anime is great, viewing the world from from a cockroaches perspective was very interesting and kinda funny sometimes. 
 
There doesn't seem to be a central story but since it's only on episode two it's kinda soon to make that assumption. 
 
I hope this anime will be continued at some point, despite its many flaws if they play their cards right I think this could be a hit for a niche group.

    I came into this hoping I wouldn't be trash for it, but I was trash for it, of course. 
 
The movie is split into four parts. Each story details the events after Free! Eternal Summer. The stories mainly center on apartment hunting, a visit to the hot springs, filming a swim club recruitment video, and a surprise party. 
 
The stories themselves are the biggest hang-up I have with the movie. They weren't too interesting in their premises. I mean ... an episode about apartment hunting. Really. How interesting can that get. 
 
But I did like it more than Free! Starting Days. That was a reconstitution of Free!, while this at least added new elements to the table. Even though it was obvious that this movie was just a lead-in to Dive to the Future, it taught us more about the characters Free! fans we know and love. 
 
(The Samezuka team was especially showcased in this movie. I love them more than ISC, so I was happy about that.) 
 
However, characters from Free! Starting Days were constantly referenced throughout TYM, which was something that I hated. This broke up the flow of the story and forced you to rethink who was who. 
 
Overall, I did enjoy Free!: Take Your Marks. It's a great addition for Free! fans. I am so excited for the third season of this show.

    Kenji Miyazawa is known for writing children's books and it shows here. This is basically a movie for children, only a bit more challenging. 
 
It's mostly apparent in the main character, Budori. He would be an ideal role model for a child: caring for his family, studying diligently, even WANTING to study, working hard and persevering no matter what. Making a heroic decision in the end only tops it off. 
 
Except he isn't. He shows no attachment to literally anyone but his little sister. Not even his parents, let alone his employers and teachers. Earlier I wrote that he cares for his family - well, technically, he does; after all, his sister is part of his family. But that's really the only person he truly cares about. Not that he isn't interacting with everyone else; in fact, he is clearly distraught when both parents leave the house, but he doesn't even remember them afterwards. Now imagine the fate of those he only had brief encounters with. 
 
On one hand, this can be seen as a good thing, we really don't need yet another idealized main character. On the other hand, this is the biggest flaw of this movie. Since there's little interaction and no attachment to any character, most of them feel like tools for making Budori spew out some lines or make some actions and once they did their job, they are disposed of, so quickly that there isn't enough time for the viewer to care about them. This is not a good way to draw attention. 
 
Speaking of drawing attention, the overall story is not really good at it, either. It IS solid and rather well-written, but not really much is going on here and it feels almost pointless. Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike the story, but I didn't really like it either. There is a boy who went through natural and personal disasters in his childhood days, managed to persevere, went to the big city, studied and saved many people from another disaster. And life goes on like it always did and always will. That's one part. Another part is the inner world of Budori, his development, his role in this world and his trying to come to terms with life and death. I personally feel this part is better done, because it actually makes use of the medium and relies heavily on symbolism, art and animation. 
 
And this is where the movie truly shines. One can literally see the amount of work that went into the art and it's really amazing. The first half of the movie is set in the countryside, so we get to see some really beautiful landscape panoramas. The second half is the city of Ihatov and while the art still remains beautiful it isn't nearly as amazing. Besides, there's quite some CGI in Ihatov, it's quite bad and does stand out because of that. Also, it feels like the movie tries really hard to be a Ghibli - but there's more to Ghibli than just the landscape art. Nevertheless, it's all really impressive. Is the mood happy and complacent? It shows in the art. Is there something new that just came to life and shines brightly? It shows in the art. Is something deteriorating over time? It shows in the art. 
 
It's even more impressive when the movie deals with Budori's inner world. Here everything becomes surreal and it's hard to tell whether the events should be taken literally, whether it's just a metaphor for something or whether it's simply embellishment. It's even harder to tell whether those scenes depict actual events or whether it's all in Budori's head. Those scenes were what I enjoyed most in this movie. 
 
To sum it up, while this movie isn't outstanding, it's really solid and does have some value. Do show it to your children but be prepared for their complaints when their attention starts wavering.

    Rosario vampire, this anime will likely catch eyes because of them pretty ladies, and that is the summit of what it offers. 
 
To be frank there will be some spoilers here and I will keep this brief, I will not describe the opening story because you can just look above and see it. 
 
This anime seems to pride itself upon the worms eye view and every standstill talking scene is at least 30% ""look at these panties while nothing is really happening"" moments. It is ok, but becomes excessive, beyond the succubus character there is no such dire need to shove ecchi into the faces of viewers. 
 
Let us delve into the true problem with the show, it does not follow the manga.... well it KIND of does but not in the way you would want it to. Take for example Shirayuki, she comes later in the story than the actual ending of the anime, hell half the anime is taken from after the same events in the manga. To be totally true, the Anime HAS around 15 chapters of the first manga thrown about out of order, but the ending of the show is chapter 10. To further compound this the first season focus' on very little that makes the manga truly great, its like Kurokami all over again, they hit some good points but totally screwed around with some major selling points and just gave it their own spin with no intention of following the story. 
 
Story 6: its OK and just that, nothing to write home about, the anime favors harem ecchi while the manga is multitudes better 
 
art 8: its good, but not amazing, the biggest plus is that it is not all over the scoreboard  depending on the episode. 
 
sound 8: good, somewhat memorable. 
 
character 6: see above, it can be placed here as well. 
 
enjoyment 8: its fun, and thats why this is so high, but this is personal preference. 
 
overall 7: will continue on to the second season and hope it gets some good stuff in. 
 
My personal quibbles: 
 
- as said before the anime does its own thing at its own speed, it could have been so much better... 
- every time moka transforms (every episode) it goes through the entire sequence and describes what is happening by a narrator. The camera pans her butt, as it enlarges, as well as her chest as a button comes loose. Unnecessary and tedious. 
- to transform, except once, mokas rosario needs to be ripped from the chain. Somehow every time Aono is trying to embrace Moko his aim is off and it goes directly to the rosario 
 
If you ended up reading any of this DO NOT READ THE CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS, the key characters descriptions are pretty much ripped from the manga and you will be sorely disappointed.

    Samurai Champloo is an interesting one. Being compared with Cowboy Bebop, and generally receiving praise regardless who I asked, I decided to watch it. I finished the anime over a weekend with a friend. My overall reaction? More or less disappointed.   
 
The anime begins with the three protagonists of the anime meeting up, fighting each other, and then teaming up. The characters themselves are interesting enough, Jin being a more stereotypical samurai, Mugen more a 'badass' sort of samurai, and Fuu the typical hot girl who can't do anything except get kidnapped. And my, does she get kidnapped.  
 
The characters are interesting enough; the huge problem I had with this anime is its focus. Every single episode the 3 heroes found themselves simply doing the bidding of the town they happened to be in. Every single episode felt like a filler to me, simply because none of the plot being revealed had anything to do with the core plot. I just finished the anime thirty minutes ago, but I've already forgotten almost all the random towns they went to, all the random characters they met, all the random things they did. But who could blame me? I didn't bother remembering any of those character's names or their back stories because I knew by the next episode they would be forgotten by the anime itself. They were all simply wastes of time in order to kill the twenty minutes of the show. Sometimes the fillers would be split into two parters, but they failed to be any more than just fillers in the end. Sometimes the fillers would have characters killed or freed from a brothel, and I was expected to get sad at certain scenes. But how could I? I had only met the characters under twenty minutes ago. They were simply pawns used to get through the twenty minutes. 
 
People sometimes praise this anime's attempt to blend modern culture with the Edo period. I frown upon it, however. The beat boxing, the graffiti, Van Gogh, Christianity, Baseball, all those things were simply distractions trying to get me to forget that I was watching a boring samurai adaptation. In the end they had nothing to do with the core plot and were as quickly forgotten by the heroes as everything else that happened. In addition, the filler stories were extremely predictable, amounting to a simple formula of introduce evil organization that survives off evil, girl gets kidnapped, fight scene, victory, credits. It was so boring I couldn't believe it. Perhaps if the anime's story had been entirely about this evil organization, and the fight scene had been built up over great plot twists and character development, I might have given two shits about this organization. Unfortunately, they are introduced and are defeated in a little over twenty minutes, just like everything else in this anime. 
 
I commemorate this anime's many references to the age of the samurai; however, I refuse to believe that in that time period every single town was corrupt, every single town had gambling men, and every single woman was forced to work in a brothel because of debts. There was certainly more things in the Edo period than just brothels, yet this anime has more than then I can count on my fingers.  
 
I feel as if this anime didn't have to be this way. If there had just been more core plot, and the anime had leaked it better over all 26 episodes, I feel like the whole thing would have been better. For instance, spread the chrisitanity issue out over more episodes, have the characters run into the issue of christianity more times. It was very central to the core plot right? So use it more! Why should I have to watch so many pointless fight scenes where the two immortal heroes just defeat everybody they happen to meet on their journey? Also, why so few episodes on developing the two samurai's? Mugen got two or three episodes on his past, and Jin got something like four. In the end, I didn't learn enough. I wanted to learn more about the main characters, not some random events happening in random towns that our heroes just happened to get involved with.

    Prison School is a nonsensical, lewd, fever dream-esque comedy. Its unique sense of humor and Machiavellian plot twists keep you wondering what will happen next. 
 
The writing is sublime. The intricate plot dovetails beautifully with the downright ludicrous, self-aware comedy. The characters are lovingly written and you'll find yourself surprisingly invested in their (admittedly nonsensical) arcs. 
 
True to the manga, the art in this anime is nice on the eyes. The voice acting is great and I thought the voice actors perfectly conveyed what the characters should sound like. 
 
This anime only lasts a season, enough to cover the first major plot arc in the manga. It's a shame they didn't continue to add more seasons, the manga gets better and better as it goes on. 
 
Prison School is a great manga that adapted to anime nicely. It has cunning writing, ludicrously funny comedy, beautiful illustration and a certain charm that makes you want more and more. I tip my hat to Hiramoto, only his deranged mind could come up with something this genius. I give it a solid 9 out of 10.

    I've heard how good the Utawarerumono VAs are, but that the first one wasn't ever translated into English (at least, not through legitimate outlets)--but no worries, there's an anime for that! It's not great to feel like you have to watch an anime just to get to the VAs--makes it feel like homework rather than fun series watching--but as far as homework goes, this went down pretty smoothly. 
 
This is about 30% typical anime harem shit (something I have very little patience for these days), 50% political maneuvering (eg, strategy and battles), and 20% sci-f oddities. I'm not usually a politics/strategy kind of guy, but the pacing of Utawarerumono makes it more digestible than most series. It also helps the 26 episodes go by quicker than I would have anticipated. It's always churning out new little mini-arcs; if you don't like the current direction, don't worry, it'll just be a couple of episodes before we're on to newer things. 
 
But the harem stuff is pretty cringe-worthy. Sure, I find the protagonist to be pretty bland--not a bad guy, but lacking an engaging personality (which is probably a result of the VA roots)--but it's more about the way the series rushes all these females into his group. Some call him father (ew), some call him master (ew, ew), but whatever they call him, they're all devoted and ready to lay down their life. Throw in an implied incest element, a touch of loli, and there's just... oof. A lot going on here, much of which I am not the target demographic for. 
 
Maybe the series' ability to be a little of everything is a part of its appeal. Because even as I was disinclined towards the ecchi, I really liked the sci-fi stuff that cropped up in the last five or six episodes. Would I recommend it for the sci-fi? Maybe not. But it really strengthened the series, giving it deeper layers than it had been pretending previously.

    First I think it is worth to mention that the Anime is quite different from the manga. The Anime  is good but the manga is far better in my opinion. So I would recommend the manga over the anime just for the plot/story. After episode 15 or something like that the anime has its own plot , totally different from the manga. The same goes for Black Butler season 2. It never happened in the manga. 
Other than that the animation and details are great. I really like the art work the costumes and every detail that is related with that historical time. 
The story is not that great or surprising. So do not expected great plot twists. There isnt something really unexpected in the story line. Many would say that there are many filler episodes but I like them because the characters are so great that you just want to watch them not matter what they do :) 
The whole story is about a 12-year-old boy Ciel , whos parent were murdered and now he is seeking his revenge. To get his revenge he made a contract with a demon, Sebastian. All the story is about them but you never get bored seeing them. Sebastian is cool and sexy and hot and sweet and all this at the same time :) 
 I like the English dub as well as the japanese. Some people dont like the eng dub but it is in victorian era so it is normal that they speak in "" weird British english"" :D

    The OG Fighting Anime, DBZ. The myth, the legend, everything I didn't know I could love about an anime. 
 
I still remember when it first premiered on Toonami and I didn't even know what to think of it. I swore I would never watch it because it looked ""dumb and weird"". And then parents around me talked about how violent it was.  
 
But one day, while impatiently waiting for my shows to come on during the Toonami block and having finished my homework early, I ended up watching an episode of DBZ. I can remember the exact episode: Gohan was still training under PIccolo with his little orange outfit and sword and was trying to make his way back home because /fuck this scary green guy amirite. By the end, I was hooked. I loved Gohan, loved Piccolo, wanted so much more of the story and characters.  
 
By the time we got to the end of the Saiyan arc, DBZ had become one of my favorite animes and it still remains one of my first ""gateway"" anime (Sailor Moon, Ronin Warriors, and Gundam Wing being the others). I was there for the Namek arc airing, I was there for the fight between Goku and Frieza and then the absolute Hype for Goku finally going Super Saiyan. I remember running out of the house screaming at my friends about it and we couldn't stop geeking out over it. It was amazing and whenever an anime can get me that excited today, I know it's special.  
 
To anyone not a fan of it, I can understand how it may look. I can even agree some of the fights can be laughable (because some of the animation in it definitely made me laugh when I was younger and especially now) but there's so much more to DBZ than that. The characters and the story are the strongest parts of it. If neither of those things was any good I would not still be stanning for this show nor would I care that it was still running.  
 
DBZ is ultimately about trying your hardest to do what is right: for you, your friends, your loved ones, the world. It's a story about failure and loss, it's a story about family and bonds, it's a story about kicking the shit out of people that threaten what you hold dear and saying ""no, you move"". It's also a story about picking battles and being smarter than just using brute force all the time (because sometimes that shit just makes things worse). It's easy to stand outside of this show and think it's dumb. I know I did when I first saw commercials about it coming to Toonami.  
 
But hey, if I can look past that and see what it's really about, anyone interested in seeing this should be able to do the same. It's worth it.

    After finishing both seasons of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, I feel compelled to give a review. This will focus on the second season, but I will draw comparisons to the first as well. If you want to watch the first season then skip this review to avoid any spoilers. While some people may be disappointed by Kai for a multitude of reasons, I found it to be about as good as the first! Let me explain. 
 
Characters - 10/10 
 
The characters are still awesome just like the first season. However, the focus is shifted to different members of the cast. Rika and Takano didn't get much attention in the first season, but now, they have all the spotlight!  
 
Rika Furude is a very determined character that the audience really wants to root for. Her main conflict throughout the series is challenging fate, as she has failed countless times. The audience really feels for Rika character and wants her to succeed. While she does doubt herself, she is not a weak character, and will pull through even the most difficult of times. I thought she had great development in this season, as she learns to place trust in those close to her in order to change the future. 
 
Hanyuu is a new addition to the cast. She does have a noticeable character arc, but I don't want to give any details so you can see for yourself.  
 
Miyo Takano is one of the greatest villains that I've seen in an anime! She is sly, cruel, and manipulative. You will end up DESPISING her, yet she still gets a nice backstory to back her motivations.  
 
The rest of the cast is still decent. Not too much is developed from the first season, but considering the shift in focus to Rika as the protagonist, it makes sense. The first season gave even attention to the club members, and while focusing on one cast member can appear more boring, I will assure you that is not the case.  
 
Story - 10/10 
 
My main gripes with this season is the plot. Now, I still found it to be really engaging and a rewarding experience. However, there were quite a few problems with it that made me give this section a lower score than the first season. To start, Kai is devoid of most of the horror elements from the first season. The original did a great job at building suspense. Much of the tension and atmosphere is lost in this series with the removal of the horror. If the first season was ""Silent Hill"", then the second is basically ""The Goonies"". All of the recommendations on the MAL page include shows such as ""Steins Gate"" and ""Madoka Magica"" as opposed to ""Elfen Lied"" and ""Another"". I wouldn't say that this different approach is bad, just very different, and viewers should be aware before going into this series expecting more slasher action. 
 
This brings me to my next problem, and that is basically the ending. Without spoiling, I will just say that the last few episodes were a little silly when it came to resolving the conflict. Many of the situations towards the end are pretty unrealistic and hard to take seriously. If you think Ewoks beating Stormtroopers in ""Return of the Jedi"" was dumb, then you will NOT like the last act of this season. From such a mature series, I was definitely disappointed with the direction the story took by the end. Not to say that I wasn't satisfied with the outcome, I was more disappointed by how clumsily it was resolved.  
 
The last problem I have with the plot is how the mysteries from the first season were answered. The first season of Higurashi mostly covered the ""Question"" chapters from the visual novel, while the second season covered the ""Answers"". Now, you do get answers to everything brought up in the first season, because honestly, the first season could be confusing for a lot of people. However, this season does the complete opposite by disrespecting the intelligence of the audience. You get your answers, but everything is extremely straightforward and forced. The writers REALLY want you to get what happened. This issue isn't that significant since you do in fact get resolution to all the shit in the first season, I just wish that it was executed better without all of the hand holding. 
 
Despite my complaints, the plot of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is pretty good! There are many twists and turns and excellent world building to make up for the shortcomings.  
 
Art - 7/10 
 
The art is a step up from the first season, which didn't have the best animation. The scenery of Hinamizawa looks great. All of the character designs stand out. Animation is generally very smooth and not jarring to look at. I don't have much more to add, the art in Kai is fairly well done.   
 
Sound - 9/10 
 
Sound design is once again amazing in the Higurashi. Voice performances are spot on, the soundtrack is used very well, and the cicada cries can't go unmentioned. I also loved both the OP and ED, never skipped them!  
 
Enjoyment - 10/10 
 
Despite my issues with the plot, I still enjoyed Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai just as much as the first season! With an engaging story, great cast of characters, and an awesome soundtrack, it's hard not to enjoy this season if you liked the first. 
 
Overall - 10/10 
 
This is an amazing series, and if you've never seen the first season, then give it a chance! I don't like how this series gets compared to yandere schlock, there is much more to Higurashi than that. Every aspect of the series is very exceptional, and I think everyone should give it a try if they like murder mysteries and horror series.

    Well, Re:Creators has concluded, and it's reception has been kind of polarizing. Either your like me and you loved it to death, or you think its boring and doesn't offer much in the way of substance. 
 
But that is kind of understandable. Due to this show's nature, the deeper meaning behind why it is written the way it was is likely to be lost on a lot of people that are not themselves a Creator. 
 
I am a writer, and have been writing for practically a decade, so watching a show about the nuance of what it means to create a world and have writers literally meeting and talking with the characters of their own works is something that not only intrigues me on a conceptual level, but causes me to deeply identify with the people and narrative of the show as I begin to put myself in their shoes and picture myself meeting my own creations if they were brought into the real world. 
 
But like I said, if you are not a Creator - or at least an analytical thinker - then this nuance is more than likely going to fly right over your head. It won't intrigue you the same way it intrigues people like me because you can't relate to the ideas and situations being presented in the show. 
 
Re:Creators is a brilliant but niche series, made by Creators - FOR Creators, and I completely understand why people outside that audience wouldn't be able to get into this show in the same way I do.

    *sniffle* Sorry, its just allergies. 
 
Pros:  
 
- Artwork looks amazing.  Nice use of soft pastels throughout most of it rather than sharp bright colors. 
 
- Characters are very likable and relatable, making the sad moments that much more impactful. 
 
- On the level of film in general, this succeeds great as a tearjerker romance in the sense of it's method of storytelling.  The film pretty much spoils it's own ending at the beginning, but still manages to leave plot twists unknown until they occur.  (I notice Japan likes to do this with their sad stories.  See also ""Grave of the Fireflies). 
 
- Delivers message in a very natural and heartfelt way 
 
- Music is very beautiful and comes in at all the right moments.  Ambience and atmosphere are handled very well also. 
 
Cons: 
 
- The after credits scene should not have been tacked on before the credits, not after. 
 
- The voice acting is overall pretty good, but a dub would still be nice.  There were a couple moments where the voice acting didn't really convey emotions as sincerely as they should have been.  
 
Overall: 
 
I went into this film expecting a good (but not masterpiece level) movie that would hit me in the feels.  Simply put, with a title as weird as ""I Want To Eat Your Pancreas"" some curiosity is bound to arise in me.  That being said, this film is way more realistic and serious than it's title would lead you on to think.  The themes of friendship were the main focus of the film, which subverted my expectations.  While there are themes of the brevity of life itself in here, I thought there would be way more emphasis on that than there was.  Instead the film goes for a message of ""don't think about how short your life is, instead use your time to cherish your relationships with people whether they be good or bad.""  I found that to be quite unique for a kind of film I was just expecting to be about ""cherish the moments"" and nothing else.  While, overall, it still feels like just another tearjerker film, I think there's enough originality in this to warrant a watch.  If you need a good cry, this is a good one to check out.

    The video review is up, but here is the written Review. This review may be a bit biased due to my fanboyism. I had an awesome opportunity to go watch this Movie in Theatres, with a bunch of awesome people. Whether they were cosplayers or just fans, this franchise has meant a lot to them. And it’s sad to see it all come to an end, but with that they gave us the fans what we wanted and ended on a high note. 
 
Story - 7/10 
 
If you haven’t seen or watched the Love Live! Yet, I recommend you go watch it, because there might be some spoilers ahead.  
 
The story begins right after the ending of Season 2 of Love Live! Where Hanayo gets an email from the organizers of the Love Live! Competition to hold another Love Live! in Tokyo Dome, but in order for that to happen, they need more publicity, so they ask μ's to go to America to give them more coverage. At least that is what the first half of the movie is about, the second half of the movie focuses more of the group μ's and their future, without spoiling too much. 
 
The first half, when μ's is in New York plays out as a rather light hearted slice of life, where the girls just basically act like how tourists should. They basically just have fun in New York leading up to their concert at Times Square. The pacing of the movie felt kind of awkward as they seem to jump through multiple plots a lot. There was so much story they were trying to fit in, so some of it concluded either awkwardly or felt too rushed. However some of the plot either made no sense or didn’t needed to be included in the first place. Such as a certain scene where A-Rise is asking to sing with μ's, although the conversation happened, it never really happened in the Movie. And there was a bit of supernatural themes in the movie as well, as we see this mystery woman in the movie, who resembles Honoka, but it’s never confirmed who she is. The story felt like it was doing too much for its 1 hour and 40 minute runtime. We see the girls go to New York, come back realizing their super famous, deciding whether to stay together or not, and organizing a concert.  However despite all this, it ended nicely.  
 
Characters - 9/10 
 
For the characters all I can is that we get an equal amount of time to spend with all  them, with the exception of Honoka, who gets the most attention. But over the course of the movie who see Honoka struggling to make a decision whether to keep μ's or disband them, and it’s that development towards the decision is what makes this story so heart-warming and incredible. The highlights are when all the girls interact with each other, the amount of time they spend with each other a reflected on how feel about each other. They all have the mentality this is the last time they spend, so all their interactions felt very emotional. However they also felt so real as well, as we can feel the emotion in their reactions. Because Love Live! has been more about the members of μ's, its sad to see them interact with each other for one last time, so their final moments together are very touching and entertaining at the same time. I still wished we saw more of the other members of μ's, because Honoka was shown a lot, and I get she’s the center, but an idol anime should be about the members, not just one character, which is kind of disappointing to me. 
 
Animation and Sound 9/10, 10/10 
 
The art style and animation is pretty much the same as the tv anime, however there is clearly more detailed put in the movie. The backgrounds look amazing, they look colourful and lively, which is something that was lacking from the tv anime. This can be seen when they go to New York and Akihabara, the environment feels so at home and warm to their real life counter parts. The girl’s designs are cute as usual. However the performances are what shines the most, even though I’m still not a huge fan of 3D, I can’t help but appreciate the choreography of the songs, they used. It runs smooth and looks nice. Where the anime shines the most is not during the 3D performances, but during the times when the characters would randomly break into song like a Disney Musical, where the animation is done in 2D, which makes me wish for them to have done the performances all in the 2D, because it looks so much  
better.  
 
There are 6 main songs in the Movie, 3 of them are Performances and 3 of them are where the characters of each year level break into song randomly. The highlights would be Sunny Day Song, when μ's is performing in front of massive crowd in Akihabara, and the fact that they had so many other idols in the background, it ran smoothly. And 2 of the songs the first and third years broke into where amazing as well, and was so awesome to listen to. There is one thing I like to say about the set list is, it feels there was too little and they didn’t really sound as good as Season 1, in my opinion. To me season 1 had better songs, but I would say the movie is slightly on par with season 2, it’s just because season 2 had Snow Halation. Also apparently the mystery woman was singing an English song, in the Japanese theatrical release, however it was just ‘lalala’ in the global release. Also speaking of the voices, big props to the studio getting actual Americans to play the New Yorkers during the New York scenes, as you can tell their Japanese was so cringe, and also hearing μ's, English was so cringe as well, but in a good way. Because that’s how they should sound, as foreigners. 
 
Enjoyment - 10/10 
 
If your fan of Love Live! You’re going to love this movie. The movie itself pays so much homage for the fans of the franchise, so as a fellow fan, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The reason for it is because I love the series and know the characters and all their personalities. A lot of the comedy are rehashed from the tv series or reflecting on the characters personalities as we know them, which is why the movie does so well, when we the fans know these are how these characters react. However if you don’t know how these characters are, you’ll be confused. There is a lot of enjoyable moments in the movie and fan service. And I’m not talking about fan service as we see sexualise content, but we see quite a few shippings here and there, which got the audience in the cinema hyped. Especially one scene that was my highlight involving Maki and Nico, who are if you haven’t guessed my favourites. But there is still a lot enjoy from this movie than just the character interactions, the performances and song bring a nice blissful vibe to the whole movie, and your just filled with glee afterwards, which works so well with the ending, because you’re happy to see these characters interact one more time. And I know from experience this is how Idols usually work, they sometime in their lives have to stop, but when they do, there is always another light at the end of the tunnel, and you can’t help but appreciate you were part of the journey.  
 
Verdict - 9/10 
 
As we begin to wrap up the review, I give the story a 7. The story is weakest part of the movie for it’s awkward pacing and plot holes, however it is a heart-warming story that should make you feel emotional in a happy way and it ended well. 
 
The Animation and Sound get a 9 and 10. The detailed put into the backgrounds and choreography are amazing to look at. And the performances in 2D are awesome to look at, but it does make me wish the 3D performances were 2D, I’m just not a huge fan of the 3D, that is all. The soundtrack it may not be as good as Season 1, but it’s still exciting and enjoyable to listen to. They are all condense with emotion, and the singing is just incredible and brings out the best in you with its happy vibe. 
 
The characters get a 9 from me, because each characters get equal amount of screen time, it’s only the fact we see Honoka too much I’m deducting a point, because it should be more about the whole group. But their interactions with each other were good and it was nice to see their relationship with each other for one more time as they develop. 
 
For my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 10. As this is a movie for the fans, the plot touched my heart and the amount of references and appreciation for the fans in the movie is incredible. This movie is indeed a big thank-you for the fans, and I enjoyed every moment of the movie. 
 
So for the overall score of Love Live! The School Idol Movie, I give it a 9/10. For casual anime fans this can be debatable, so this movie is aimed towards its fans. I recommend this movie as a must watch for Love Live! fans there is so much tributes for them. I also recommend this to idol fans as the story is very touching and light hearted to enjoy. As Love Live! fan this movie is a big amazing send off for μ's, the anime at least, because I don’t know if the actual group is stopping yet.

    Trotting down a dimly lit stairway lost in worries, walking hurriedly along a corridor seemingly without end, you come across a painting - a feast of colours and of animals frolicking, the flickering of faint candlelight casting on it a breath of life.  Such a contrast it is to the pale grey walls, such bewildering emotions it instils, so incongruous with the world it’s in; such is Kyousougiga. Set in the Mirror Capital of Kyoto, an amalgam city of old and new, a world where the boundary between man and god is blurred, is a story of a family coming into terms with each other. It is the tale of lives imbued with untamed strokes and vivid hues.  
 
It starts with the departure of Myoue and Koto, father and mother, to a realm unknown, leaving their children with a promise to one day return with the beginning and the end in tow. The once idyllic family life is torn apart, and thus begins the magical story of Kyousougiga. 
 
The heart of Kyousougiga is family values, a return to the simpler joys in face of the looming anxieties of life. We are all brought up to face the responsibilities and demands of reality, to bust our bubble of idealism and to be bereft of innocence. Indeed, didn’t we all face the woes our protagonist Koto does, when we were slowly piled under duties and expectations without understanding them, when we only wanted to live a simple and joyous life? Kyousougiga is a reaction against the industrialized society in which so many are weighed down by utilitarian worries and the monotony of working life. 
 
As if a direct contrast to the grey high-rises and symmetry which lines our streets, the world of Kyousougiga is filled with various architectural styles and imagery. The environment is based primarily on old Japan, but anachronistic elements like western castles, futuristic technology, and even arcane ribbons fluttering in the sky, infuse this world with a dreamlike vivacity unlike anything else. The art is drawn with wild strokes and vibrant colours, movements with fluidity and reckless rapidity, and facial expressions with unrestrained expressiveness. The lively world of Kyousougiga and the ebullient tone of the series is an antithesis to our excessive rationality; it is a reflection of our imagination which was once so unbridled and unconforming.  
 
Yet, all of us are bound to face the pressures of reality. Myoue’s and Koto’s departure were inevitable, and the siblings each find their own ways to cope with this loss. Yase, half demon, half a spoiled princess, consoles herself in reminiscence and nostalgia. Devastated by her loss, she can only accept and mourn in this fate. Sifting through old memories of her mother, she longs for times long past, reaching ever further for the beginning. Kurama, the eldest sibling, prodigy and visionary, sets his sights on the future. Following his father’s will, he innovates new technology and organizes Kyoto with hopes to one day find a means to break out of it, to grasp the end. Young Myoue, heir of his father, deals with their departure through indolence and indulgence. Utterly dejected yet unwilling to admit it, he spends his days in denial of his grief and in escape from his duties. Thus lives this melancholy triad in their unassuming bubble, disunited and unable to fill the emptiness of their heart.  
 
Then there is our protagonist Koto, youngest of the siblings and a headstrong fool of a girl. Alienated by her surroundings and unsure of her identity, yet never willing to display her vulnerabilities and always bursting with energy, she ventures into the mirror capital with the mission of finding her mother. Down the rabbit hole she falls, and she shall experience the full extent of the joys and sorrows of growing up, of the mounting pressures and of expectations unfulfilled.  
 
Through all this turmoil Koto remains strong; her constant smile and foolhardy attitude disturbs as much as it inspires those around her. She is unconcerned with the past or future and lives the present to the fullest, be it helping others or making unreasonable demands. With hammer in hand, she smashes the boundary of worlds and confronts the parents who deserted them. Kyousougiga is about living in the present; to confront reality, stare into it eyes, and see the all colours about you. It is about reconciling the bubbles of our wistful imagination with the harsh world around it through the help of those around you. Myoue and mother Koto love their children immensely; they scramble all their resources and some more to give their children love, care, and a world where they are provided all that they need. Yet, they neglect their foremost duty as so many parents nowadays do – to always be there for their children.  
 
Indeed, “Coming home five minutes earlier than usual,” says Koto as she plants her forgiving fist into her father’s cheeks, “that sort of thing is love!” Kyousougiga is not just lively in tone, its very essence is one which breathes life into the viewers. It is a fairytale of vibrant colours and simple joys, of familial troubles and love likewise. It truly is that brilliant painting of which a fleeting glimpse you catch, but an enduring impression you get.

    Well Well Well .. Death Note ! Even my friends that don´t watch anime already heard this name somewhere ... it one of the most known animes out there .. for good reasons but also bad ones :D. (For who saw knows what i'm talking about).  
 
I don´t want to extend this, so i will make a short review and try to say everything that there is to say.  
 
Story: (9/10). Nice plot, consistent, solid, fluent. It is simple, but at the same time it is complex due to development attached to it. The plot is interesting, it looks nice, it looks fresh. It isn´t something over explored, but i felt that it's not that original though. Instead of weapons or big armies, or crazy stupid guys that usually are ugly and had a pretty messed up past, we have a student, a smart and looking good one, with a note. Well the wish to command the world isn´t something new, what is new is the character being so young, and the way that he pretends to do it.  
 
Basically this anime is based on a mental fight between a detective and our main character, Yagami Light(in the anime he gets the nickname Kira, so let's call him Kira). The all concept is nice for it self, plus with the interaction between the detective (who name is ""L"") and Kira we got a super interesting anime. Normal conversations or normal tennis games became Epic. I don´t want to tell you the why otherwise i would have to spoil.   
 
Art: (9/10). For the year when it was made (2005), gosh the animation is even better that some animes that are being released now ! The glow of the characters makes them look pretty nice. They are not flat, they are well shaped, all look pretty normal but at the same time, as we go trough the anime we start to realise how peculiar the design is, and how cool it gets. The background is also nice.  
 
Sound: (10/10).  What a piece of art ! Such wonderfull soundtracks, such amazing OST that i got pleased just by hearing it. The sound here has the same effect that the sound on AoT has. It makes the action look tons times better, more epic !. Everything is good here. And what about the opening? The second opening it's okay .. it is related to the plot and it gives us an idea of how Kira feels about humanity. The first Opening? Jeez what a piece of art ! The dark theme, the metaphorical meaning, the lyric and even the music style fits perfectly in the action, in the plot, in the characters, IN EVERYTHING ! This is one of those animes that made such a  good work that when we look up to other animes we just make them look worst from what they really look like.  
 
Character: (10/10). I'm getting tired to praise this anime but i have to do it. It is just outstanding. We have 2 main characters. L and Kira. Then we have a third one but no one gives a crap about it. Only 2 character. Although they were the best character i've ever seen besides Yuno. Great look, great development, great background story and, great interaction between them both that just make them even better. Basically both are super brilliant guys, but while Kira is organized and popullar, L is the oposite. I loved the contrast between them both, it just looks amazing. They both look like the same, but at the same time they look so different.. Each one has it's own personality and way to be, and they have special habbits. For instance L just can be sitting on his knees because it increases his brain capacity about 40% .. things like this that make them look so nice ! So original, so different from the rest.  
 
Enjoyment: (8/10)  What a failure ! That bad thing that i talked about right at the begining ? Well there it is. In the middle of the anime they made something that completely blowed up the anime. If it wasn´t for that part, the enjoyment it would be another 10/10 ... The first part, the first 25 episodes, it is just absolutely brilliant ! Brilliant i repeat. I couldn´t stop watching that, i felt sick i was totally sick while i was watching this. My eyes were glowing and my mouth was with a huge smile of admiration.. But .. it just gets lost. And personally, that end made everything even worst. This is based on my personall opinion. The end or it will be perfect, or if you are like me, it will suck for real. Some of my friends said that the end was trully amazing. For me .. taking in consideration what could have happened instead of what really happened, it was the WORST ending ever for me. It just makes no sense. Although it is a beautiful ending i have to say, it just didn´t pleased me.  
 
The themes trated here are really serious and interesting. They are explored in a realistic way. I reccomend this show for everyone since it is at my point of view, a piece of art that everyone must see.

    First on the name, before i watch this anime i check the name, i though it was boring to watch because of the name of anime, but i was wrong to judge it "" dont judge the book by its cover"" or dont judge the anime by its title. 
 
story: 
The story is unique, a boy who is addicted in playing games, but not an ordinary game, dating sim. But what happen if that dating sim will become real, and your life is depend on that game?  
at 1st, i thought katsuragi will just ignore it and find another way to remove that thing in her neck, but he just accept it. 
 
 
sound:  
The opening is good to hear and ending song, the background sound when katsuragi is explaining or talking is match. 
 
 
character: 
i like katsragi because he`s like an overpower character in action anime. Meaning he knows everything or master every subject, he dont need help always depending on her self and to his skills. 
elsie, a annoying demon that become katsuragi`s partner, this anime become more enjoyable because of this soul catcher. 
 
 
enjoyment: 
different expression of different girl he conquer, i like it because it gives me motivation to conquer a girl that you like.  
 
overall: 
9/10- i like the story and everything because every girl he conquer, you can learn many things in real life. :)

    I'm a fan of ecchi. I enjoy fan service. That being said, I'm not sure how this anime is scoring a rank higher than 5 or 6 (which is what most ecchi anime score). There is really not that much to be enjoyed here besides the incestuous obsession with his little sister, some ripping on Stephanie (the comic relief character), and lots of bright colors. 
 
The two main characters always win, there is never a struggle. Honestly, it's very lacking in the ecchi department for an ecchi series, and it's very lacking in character development, more realistic story base, and struggle for anything but an ecchi series. I think whereas it tried to succeed in both, it ends up failing both. 
 
To sum it up, I can't imagine anyone who is not an ecchi lover or a siscon find any real interest here. This is a pretty average ecchi anime, with maybe a bit more money being put into colors and animation.

    This is what SAO should've been. If you disliked it, then there's a high chance you'll like this instead. Same set of rules (video-game world, see No Game No Life type of world, though)  but a much, much, much (repeat the word much at your will) better than SAO. 
 
The story is pretty simple, though it doesn't try to be over complicated due to the nature of the show. It's just simple and to the point; there's no A, B or C into it. It's just... simple. It focuses mostly on comedic effect, though with some (I'd say very rare) serious or dramatic moments. 
 
Art is gorgeous. There's nothing much to it, but sometimes the occasional ""ecchi"" artstyle to it. Given the nature of the show, that ""ecchi"" artstyle might just improve on the satirical representations of the characters. That said, everything is pretty fluent and flows according to the situation at hand. Same can be said about the Music and Sound, they're in the right places and the music accurately represents the situation at hand. There's a few iconic pieces here and there (see: 30 Everyday Delusion A.K.A. Darkness' theme song). Voice Actors are on spot. Especially Aqua's (you'll see what I mean). Voice actors tend to be on spot in this anime and prepare to have a great experience in that regard. 
 
Overall this is a very good anime with all its right stuff in the right places. It's a very funny anime and definitely overshadows its competitors in the 'game world'. Try it out for a spin, the show's only 10 episodes long and if you don't like it in the first few episodes (I'd say give it 3-4 episodes before the characters start to grow on you) then the show isn't really going to change and you can mostly forget about it.

    Oh, man .... I actually dropped Monster the first time I watched it and gave it a three. Man, was I dumb or what ?!? 
This is one of the coolest anime ever, I would recommend it to everybody, however, I think that liking it depends on the mindset you currently have. What I mean is Monster strays a lot from what you would call a regular anime, it is very unique so you cannot compare it with something else. You have to be prepared for a slow-paced story, mostly psychological and it will leave you wondering what is happening at every turn. Every time you learn something new about the story that single fact will raise ten more questions, now that`s what I call cool. . 
For those of you who have watched you know: 
 
Story 10 
Art 10 
Sound 10 
Character 10 
Enjoyment 10 
Overall 10  
 
And I don`t think I have to explain my self. 
Now for those of you who haven`t watched it, JUST WATCH IT and you will know what I am talking about.

    as always this genre ignites the veins of glamorous battles that fall in love with many, I have always liked, the story is now of badminton with women and one with an elite talent, the story I like is pretty enfaciz in almost all secondary characters giving a degree of appreciation on the screen but still have to expose, the story advance very fast in my opinion is quite different from manga in the order of events, its animation undoubtedly I like quite gives the touch of suspense ideal to the series , acceptable soundtrack, acceptable story and in general acceptable, I do not think it will shine like gold series more like silver still lacks enough to be a great series for going to a good level

    For some shows, I feel it necessary to go through each category and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. But for this one, I was really only left with two significant realizations: 
 
1. Watching Toradora! is like taking a stallion's dose of viagra just before strolling through a Renaissance art gallery. Never, in my entire life, have I seen a show that draws out the sexual tension between its characters for so long. The cruelty of this phenomenon, however, was intensely refreshing. Most other shows in the same genre rely solely on eye candy to hold their viewers' attention; Toradora! simply refuses to do that- and with good reason. It's as if the producers are shouting, ""look, everyone- we've got great voice actors, great music, great character development, and a great plot- so we're not going to spam cleavage every two minutes and risk having you miss out on all the good stuff."" 
 
2. If you're similar to me, you probably don't like a few specific genres. Not just anime genres- I'm talking about all forms of art. For instance, I don't particularly like country music, modern art, or- and here's where I retain topical relevance- romance anime. I mean, seriously. Nine times out of ten, animated romcoms make me feel like a perverted, balding sociopath. Or at least, I'm pretty sure that they would if I had actually watched ten of them (and I definitely haven't). But the thing is, every genre has at least a couple masterpieces- art that even the snobbiest critics can't help but appreciate. Well, Toradora! is definitely one of the few exceptions to my hatred for romantic anime. The reason I bring this up is to encourage those of you who are on the fence to give it a try. People who normally like romcoms have already seen it ages ago; but I can almost guarantee that you'll enjoy it, too- regardless of how cynical you may be.

    You stumbled across this page, because you wondered what is One Piece, but probably, your most important question, that has been poking your mind since some time is: Should I watch it? 
 
Now the basic facts. There are currently 688 episodes aired, and that's probably bit more than half of the planned material Eiichiro Oda (the manga creator) has . To catch up to the current arc you would need to sacrifice around 40 average anime series (or you could do just a lot of different staff in your life, right?). That's more than ten days of constant watching. So how to measure if it's worth it? How to benchmark it? 
 
Before you will read further you need to be totally aware of one thing: the anime is slow, the pacing is awful, more so then ever in the newest arcs. It's like they are trying to squeeze all the money they can from the audience (the Toei animation studio), the same thing that Naruto is currently doing. 
Also, the anime in my opinion, has a pretty much a love/hate relationship going on, and to measure it for yourself, you would need to consider watching around 100-110 episodes. Now if compared to 700 or 1000 it's or even more it's not that bad... 
 
The reason for that, is that the real action begins with the Alabasta Saga (saga consists of few arcs), that starts at episode 62. If the Alabasta Saga won't get your full attention, you will feel forced to stare at the screen etc., dislike this and that, then you should consider dropping  One Piece for your own safety. If, on the other hand, you will find yourself immersed in the anime, waiting impatiently before you can watch the next episode, welcome on the love train.  
 
Also consider this. One thing is to watch anime that has the standard 12-24 episodes (or just a bunch of seasons), another thing is to watch anime that has hundreds of episodes. Obviously, to keep the quality level constant in such big series (or manga series for the fact) is just impossible. If you won't like Alabasta, it will be hard to keep on watching later. Now there are better arcs then Alabasta, but do you want to watch another 100 episodes just to get to them?  
       
All in all, the best way, from the neutral point of view would be just to write down the aspects that create One Piece, make it what it is, and depend on how you respond to them, watch or just leave, it's just as simple as that, having of course in mind what I wrote above: 
•	Humor with mix of goofing around 
•	Slow, bad pacing at times 
•	Long Battles - full shounen style 
•	Good Story that connects all the Sagas 
•	Great Characters with their own personal story (especially the crew) 
•	Many black and white characters, you are either good or bad 
•	Simple, meaningful emotions, that even the youngest audience will understand (especially friendship) 
•	Repetitive at times  
•	Very good voice acting ( I am NOT watching a dubbed version) 
•	Pretty much no death  
•	Just decent music and art even in the newest arcs 
•	Enormous world and enormous amount of characters that you will stumble across your journey 
•	Creativity regarding the laws, history, organizations, countries, buildings (size of some of them is truly astounding) and most obviously all the POWERS the shounen characters get  
•	Predictable at times 
•	Generally, over the top design of many aspects of the manga and anime 
•	Misconception regarding some terms: like pirates, government, marines etc. 
 
Know the author of this simple review is a bit of fan of series, but I tried to stay as objective as possible. So the high score for me is obvious.  
 
Thanks for reading.

    If you are watching this anime just for the action, then you'll be missing the main point. Many people complained that they wish the story would focus a little more on violence, but thats not what the story is about; the violence and guns is just what bonds the girls together. 
 
In general, I simply loved this anime. Everything about it. I loved the art for it, looks very high quality no matter where you watch the show, if streaming or non streaming. The opening and ending songs with any melodies in between were in fact music to my ears.  I was drawn in by the story line the most, however, for it is like one I would have never imagined in my life. This is always how I compare things, to if I would have ever been able to come up with the story. Sure the main points of the story seem familiar: assassins, training school, young girls fighting, etc. But the characters and elements that develop a long with the tale is something that exceeds what I ever could have created. If you were an innocent little girl, dying for one tragic case or another, and there was no other cure other then to become inhuman, what would you do? The government finds you somehow randomly from the hospital you're at and gives you the option: stay alive, get a new chance at life, but with you're memory erased of the past and at the cost of becoming an assassin for the remainder of that life killing so called ""bad guys""? Or, would you say no and die? 
 
The story unwinds with 5 little girls who had made the choice to live; each assigned an ""older brother"" (their partner). You slowly learn the past of each girl, their struggles, and their skills during missions. But theres a twist; you also learn the partners past story and skills. At first I didn't understand why that was even needed, the anime story itself was already so good! But then it dawned on me: what type of person would it take to sell their life into secrecy and devote yourself to training a stranger, a random little girl? Each partner chooses which little girl to save and become partners with. Some are harsher then others and how they treat the little girls, as the girls newly developed personality starts to reveal this. The ""older brothers"" themselves have dark pasts that are portrayed slower than the girls. This is because at first you think you understand the partner and therefore understand the little girl, but then all of the sudden you learn even more about the partner; realizing that you're theories of why a older brother treats the younger sister a certain way is in every way wrong. 
 
The anime not only has action, adventure, drama, suspenseful, and with comedy every now and then; but also a proper portion of romance. Though these girls are some of the best assassins in Italy, they are still little girls struggling to deal with growing up. Struggling with how to gain attention, first time crushes, and love. Soon, you start to experience their adolescence with them and feel yourself maturing with each new knowledge the character gains as well. Causing you to relate deeper to each character then you had planned, making their situation that more real. 
 
 
Note: My friend read the manga, so if you plan on watching the anime (both seasons, like I did) then theres no disappointments or anything, but the manga continues with different girls stories at the company while the anime stops after the second season. Just a note if you start to love this anime and can't believe its about to end or did end.

    This is only the second review I have written on MAL, but I'm gonna try and keep it as short and sweet as possible. I feel like a lot of reviews go into way too much detail, and leave very little room for you to experience the show for yourself.  
 
The Rising of the Shield Hero is pretty good 
 
I don't think it's an amazing show, but definitely worth watching if you are into the Isekai genre. If you like shows such as SAO, Log Horizon, and Re:Zero then Shield Hero is gonna be right up your alley. If you aren't a fan of those shows that I mentioned then you probably aren't gonna get much out of Shield Hero since it shares a lot of the same themes. My biggest problem with Shield Hero is that it tends to get a bit too haremy for my taste, but I'm sure that most people would be able to overlook that since it is pretty common in these types of shows. I also find the 3 other heroes besides Naofumi (the MC) to be complete morons. They tend to just do whatever they are told even if it makes absolutely no sense. Most of the the decisions they make just seem completely stupid, and none of them seem to have any common sense. They are insanely gullible characters, and it definitely got on my nerves. Other than that, the show is enjoyable and has a great mix of action/adventure and a bit of romance sprinkled in. I wish the relationship between Raphtalia (raccoon girl) and Naofumi became a bit more fleshed out, but I'm hoping that will progress more in the second season. Overall, I definitely recommend it. It's a solid show, and a welcomed addition to the Isekai genre.

    Do you like Hunter X Hunter and Full metal? Then please promtpy turn around and stay far away from the anime is shit-ru-to.  
 
People may tell you, ""No, it's really good"" or ""It's really entertaining"" but those same people would probably tell you ""Manbuns are cool"" or are addicted to minecraft.  
 
Watching this anime is like smoking cigarettes. I really wish I could quit, and they're terrible for me, and I can't smoke in public and it isn't as cool as I thought it was going to be, but fuck I just can't stop. I wish I had a nicotine patch for Naruto. A Naruto patch if you will.  
 
Let me break it down for you in a step by step.  
 
First start smoking: The beginning 
 
Yea, all your friends do it, and it looks cool, and that guy from the walking dead smokes and bitches love him right? Well yea, the show is pretty good when it starts off as far as plot goes. You think the plot is really cool, and it is. It's like a mustang gt shelby. You know you like Nissan GTR's more, and you know they are better cars, but there's nothing quite like a mustang. So you watch it, and you keep watching it, and you enjoy it. The effects haven't caught up to you yet. You're enjoying it. The animation is good, great even, and boy the fight scenes and new characters are fucking cool! I mean, deidara and sasori? These akatsuki are badass. oh & look there's itachi, and oh boy, sasuke is back! woah, naruto learns a new power? Woah, demon fights! The animation is kicking ass, the music soundtrack if fucking prime well known and skilled artists and the theme music is pretty good man. Full sails, and you're off.  
 
a year of smoking- The middle 
 
Okay, it's really not that cool anymore. People have started to tell you you're teeth are getting yellow, and your skin isn't as clear. Oh, and you always smell. And you can't smoke in your car, or in restaurants, and you gotta get up to go smoke and that pisses you off because you're friends are talking shit on you. That's now naruto. You're like, okay, the anime quality has gone down. The art is a bit doofy now, and the animation budget? Did you guys lose a lawsuit? Then there's the fillers. You're like, okay, I guess that one was okay but now this is the 5th one in like 60 episodes, wtf? Then the plot goes way off track and you're like, okay, well I guess it will just get better. So you keep smoking, and say ""fuck all those people. I'll just hang out with smokers from now on"".  
 
2 years of smoking- The end 
 
Now you always reek, you can't hang around your nephew, and all your new friends are white trash and smoke newports, and you only smoke camels. You've given up hope, and the doctor says you need to cut back or else. Naruto is now garbage, and you know it is you piece of shit. The animation is laggier than a 1 legged prostitute, and the artwork has been handed over to 12th graders in a graphic design class from somewhere in Upstate Newyork. The plot is now on a different planet, and there's no fucking life there. Good luck finding water fuckhead. Now all your hope is in the music, the only good thing left, and in the remaining characters, which have dwindled down to a small ewok army on the shitty planet that is endor. You don't even enjoy it anymore, you just want it to end. You'll try quitting, but you remember the mange had cool fights and there was that one fight you wanted to see, so you're right back on it, smoking it up. Every episode is a cancer you wish would just explode. You pray for the end of the series with fierce determination that rivals that of a born again christian.  
 
Conclusion? 
I plead dear would be viewers. Don't you fucking dare watch this show. I don't care what your best friend said. Fuck him, he probably watches kill la kill and thinks it's really good and unique.

    Abenobashi Mahou Shoutengai 
 
First when I heard this anime's name, it made me think of a bunch of cute magical girls with pink hair and super round eyes casting spells and fighting against evil. Something I totally wouldn't watch. Then I noticed the producer is Gainax, which immidiately made me intrested of the series. So, watched it and I'm happy I did. 
 
ABOUT: 
Abenobashi tells a story of two childhood friends, Arumi and Sasshi. They live in the peaceful city of Osaka spending time with each other and just hanging around. However, Arumi is going to move to Hokkaido with her family and Sasshi's pretty shocked when he finds it out. After few strange incidents these kids get sucked in different worlds. Time and period changes every time but the city and the people in it remain, although their settings change. Only Arumi and Sasshi can remember their 'real' world, everyone else are living their lives like it has always been the same. Arumi and Sasshi are trying to figure out why they are shuffling these weird paradox-worlds and how they can get back to their original world.  
Abenobashi has many movie references from famous American films which is a funny twist when you recognize them. Each episode contains a different world with different set-ups, varying from fairyland to a world of war. Even the art style changes making you really wait for the next episode. It’s a story about life and changes that come along with it. 
 
ART: 
As I am a big fan of Gainax productions, I really enjoyed this art. It reminds me of FLCL, maybe being a bit more mellow and pastel-colored. Still it has those little details and fast paced movements that makes it super-enjoyable in my eyes. I wish there would be more animes made with this same style. 
 
SOUND: 
The atmosphere is mostly created by the art and dialogue/storytelling, so the music mostly stays in the background. The music isn’t that intense but it fits in nicely.  Voice actors in the other hand are extremely good choices! None of them made me irritated, they fit really well with their characters. Sometimes it's really a pain in the ass when you find a good series but the voice actors suck so bad it makes you not even want to watch it at all. Gladly that's not the case in this one.  
 
CHARACTER: 
The main characters are really good friends with each other. Sasshi’s a good example of a teenage boy who’s still a bit childish with his dreams and behavior, while Arumi is a bit more mature and she easily gets mad by Sasshi’s ‘stupid’ actions. We get a peek of their familiesl and their pasts as well, which makes you understand the main characters and their intensions better. All of the characters are unique persons, they have their own story and goals to reach. In every episode the background-characters positions change, though they still manage to remain their personalities. 
 
OVERALL: 
If you have watched FLCL and liked it, you totally need to watch this. Abenobashi’s wacky, energetic and humorous. It makes you laugh and smile but some episodes might make you cry and leave you with chills. Because of the jumping from world to world, this anime has a little bit of something to everyone. You should watch it, even if only once.

    First of all I loved the « original » YuGiOh Duel Monsters. 
When I heard about it going to the big screen I was psyched. The trailer was great. 
But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,  
try something new.  
 
There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.  
Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies. 
So eventually the duel is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original. 
 
The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it. 
I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy.

    Bleach is a mixed blessing for me personally, it does many things right, and fails at others. It suffers from what we call &quot;mainstream anime&quot; - don't get me wrong, bleach was the first anime series I ever watched, and actually got me into this whole scene - for that i'm thankful. 
 
There are hardly any complaints about the story, but it's nothing out of the ordinary or anything worth praising - the main problem is all the delays, when you desperately want to know what happens next - suddenly the tension breaks down and we're left watching a filler series, which has no impact or relation to the story, nothing, zero. 
 
The art direction is absolutely great, which can be seen most vividly during the various fights between the characters. While it tends to keep itself serious when it needs to, whenever the mood lightens or humor is added, the art is always appropriate. 
 
Sound is basically your own personal opinion, whether you like the voice acting or not is up to you - I personally thought Rukia sounded like a chicken screeching throughout the series. Same goes for the intro and end themes, of which I think there are about five in total (&lt;-5 intros 5 ends) -there'll be at least one which will make you puke uncontrollably and others will put you into a hazy exotic coma. 
 
The characters could easily be a 10/10 as the series even takes the time to expand on every one of them, except at times you're left  wondering, what's the point of spending time on someone who'll never show up again? 
 
When 1/4 of the entire series is a filler, it should logically receive 3/4 of a perfect score. I highly recommend people to skip the bounto arc which appears around episode 70, all the way to around 108, as it has NO effect on the story, many pretend it didn't even happen. And currently 170+ is another abomination in the making. But aside from those enjoy the rest of the series with nearly atleast one fight per 1-2 episodes. 
 
Mainstream anime exists to have many viewers, they're afraid to take risks and make interesting decisions - they'll pull you in and make you sit through 250+ episodes, each 20 minutes long - when only maybe 100 of those are relevant to the story. If i can make a recommendation, I suggest reading the manga instead.

    Though the animation occasionally veers into Bad Drawing Land, and all the sitting around (close up, pan, rinse, repeat) and yadda yaddaing can get very old on the eyes, the mental aspect of the anime is certainly up to par. If you can get over the anime and sound aspects, and don't crave explosions every other episode, this series could very well be a good choice. I certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys following a good mind game or two. 
 
Character-wise, it's pretty neat knowing that each character is supposed to have a specific mental disorder. Light and L have Sociopathy and Asperger's, respectively. Wikipedia them if you find that kind of thing interesting, like I do.

    *spoiler free* 
 
As i often do with shows i don't like, i'll start with the positives. 
 
The art is good. The music is decent, and everything feels up to par to modern industry standards. That's about it. Then what about the bad? Well, there's surprisingly not a lot of that too - its slice of life (which doesn't HAVE to be a negative but when its TOO boring it is), there is not a lot of comedy, which would probably save this show, at least for me. The story and characters are very poor - moe blobs that fit standard tropes and don't do anything outstanding... 
 
So what made me drop the show instead of at least finishing it? I've seen far less good looking, far more boring and plain, badly made shows that i DID finish... So why? I shall put it in one simple sentence. 
 
The protagonist is TOO PITIFUL TO WATCH. 
 
That's right. Looking at someone cripplingly poor, stupid, gullible, immature, but who just wants a normal life and is NOT obnoxious get bullied around (lightly and comedically) is, at least for me... Hard. To make matters worse, unlike say Hinamatsuri's Anzu, the character is not interesting enough and the show doesn't manage to create interest and COMPASSION to at least keep you going... They crack jokes at her crippling poverty and helplessness. This show is like watching someone get bullied in real life, while everyone seems to try pretend its funny, except you can't do anything about it aside watch, or get on with your life. So i did. And as far as recommendations go, i'd say you probably should do the same.

    Kuzu no honkai final review . 
 
Welcome to the cringe festival and edgy characters that’s what this anime offers to the viewer. 
 
Story 0/10 
If you thought this was a original story or a piece of art made by the author you were very wrong.This anime tries to express the feelings and hardships that teenage go through until they grow up but it fails miserably. 
 
The story is set in a school very original I must say and it’s about unrequited love or how to be cringy about the person you love.From the first episode until the last episode there is no story in this anime.It’s all about the main heroine victimization and monologue about how she perceives the world around her and her interactions with other characters, and it’s a very autistic one. 
 
It’s all about sex and how to solve problems by having sex or to stop halfway because we need drama and suspans for the viewer.What a joke and a insult for love and the person you love and spend your life with her. Shame on you author! 
 
Characters 2/10 
I never saw a show about romance with this kind of bland characters that have no connection to the story or plot in this anime.The way they work with each other it’s a mess and they ruin the anime . 
 
Hanabi is the heroine of this show , her character is the silent type and the one who watches from the side lines like a fool, she is egoist has a cold heart and the way she acts and interacts with others around her it’s annoying. 
 
Mugi this is the most useless character he is just a plot device and his only purpose is to have sex in all the anime.Sometimes he tries to act as a smartass but fails .  
 
Akane is the best girl and the only character who has development in the whole anime.Her character development is amazing and it’s a fact from a person who is lonely and looks for affection and attention in the bed of different men to a lovely person who has found the warmth in her heart called “family”. 
 
Moka this character was presented in one episode and then tossed away from the rest of the series and why she was even present in this anime to begin with? 
 
Ecchan was added as a spice character for those who love yuri stories and cringe festivals about how two girls who love each other and have sex and then  break up. 
 
Enjoyment 0/10 
Only masochists would enjoy this kind of show or fangirls who believe in stories about a prince on a white horse. It’s annoying and forced drama all over the place plus the characters make the enjoyment worse. It’s a waste of time watch better anime like Shouwa Rakugo. 
 
Animation 8/10 
The use of panel manga and roses all over the show in a repetitive way makes it unique but brings no sense to the story tbh. 
 
Sound 2/10 
Its awful the soundtrack I don’t know how the opening is good when it’s the same as the anime filled with autistic characters and roses. 
 
Overall 3/10 
The last episode did not resolve anything or have a conclusion like a ending is supposed to do for a series it was the same as first episode the only character development for the characters was the hair some of them cut their hair short. And the teacher from glasses he has contact lens now. 
What a waste of money time and nerves for the Lerche studio .

    I like that every other manga or poster featured in the background settings have become anime now. Kuma Miko, Servamp, Re:ZERO, Taboo Tattoo. 
 
The story and ""plot"" is pretty simple. Bunch of co-workers, friends working at a manga shop. It's nothing too special except for the fact that there are romantic tension between a majority of the characters.What bothered me is how the story introduced the romance between the girls and the guys. They kept it subtle at some-points during the story. Then there were scenes where anything could happen like kissing or... maybe sex but not really. 
 
The second bothersome part of the story is that nobody was paired together towards the end. I couldn't fathom what the point of adding all of those intense scenes where characters could have potentially had created a romantic relationship; if there was no intention of acting upon on it. It left a bad taste in my mouth. 
 
As for the comedy that the story has to offer. It's actually not that bad. There are a bunch of random moments where hilarity ensues and those moments are quite effective! Besides the romance, the comedic moments where something that I had fun looking forward to seeing each episode.Overall the story was good however, I felt like if the romanctic intentions were acted upon, then the story would have been much more satisfying to sit through. Too much teasing and not enough action were my main reason of giving the story a low 5. 
 
The art and animation was certainly unique. I think the character designs were the best thing about the show. I felt like the character designer did a great job of making characters both stand out and... cute. Background settings were pretty nice too. As I mentioned earlier there are a lot of shout-outs to other popular light novels and manga featured in the background of the work shop. 
 
The sound department could've been better however, I don't really think it had much of an impact on the show. When I went back to re-watch this, I noticed that the soundtrack doesn't really play a part in a majority of the scenes that play out in Denki-Gai. The voice actors were great. They did a pretty amazing job with the romance scenes. I felt that they put a lot of emotion into their characters and that made them feel ""real.' 
 
The characters themselves were great to a certain extent. I felt like each of them had a good personality to them. They were likable and there interactions with each other were always fun to watch. Especially when they would do competitions with their rivals. My only problem with the characters would have to be the lack of pairing. As mentioned earlier the romantic tension between most of the characters was play a big part in why I loved the series. However, not having the characters properly confess and pair up in the end ruined my experience. 
 
Enjoyment for the series was above average. I was able to remain engaged in the story, there were plot developments that took me by surprise, and I was happy with the comedic moments. It's sad that the only thing that killed a lot of my hype and good impression for the series was the lack of pairing the couples together. 
 
Overall Denki-gai no Honya-san is pretty good, despite the failed relationship pairing and romance. I gave it a 7/10 because it manages to remain interesting as well as hilarious at times. When there are romantic scenes I like feeling involved in them. I would highly recommend this series for casual watching.

    There are somethings that the anime has done that i've liked. First of all the whole season was very good living up to any expectations that I had for the season. If you liked the first season in the series, then you'll like the 2nd season in the series. And, if I were to rate the anime on specific factors I would rate it like this:  
 
Story[7]:  
The story isn't the best in the world and it has never been claimed to have the best story in the world. It does however have a story that can hold the anime together enough so it makes sense, and the anime actually has a plot.  
 
Setting[8]:  
The setting for the anime is one of the more unique ones when it comes to dealing with devils. It doesn't immediately put the devils in the negative spotlight as many other animes would. The setting for the anime is also perfect for the genre of the anime. 
 
Characters[7]:  
Characters aren't the best characters possible, but they also aren't the worst characters. You can see the different type of ""Moe"" characters and its characteristics in the different characters. So, overall the characters of the anime aren't anything new and can be seen in other animes.  
 
Enjoyment[9]: 
I greatly enjoyed the anime for what it was set out to do and also create an anime that fits the genres of  Action, Comedy, Ecchi, Romance, and harem. The genres for the anime are really the main points that anyone chooses to initially watch the anime, or any anime for that matter. It lives up to all of the genres its included in and also creates and enjoyable experience while doing so. The Ecchi genre is one of the main genres for the season and if you don't like ecchi for tip toes on the borderline of full nudity, then you wont like this. However with that said, if you like or are looking for and ecchi anime of that caliber then this anime is worth the watch.  
 
Overall[8]:  
The overall rating of the anime gets is a 8 out of 10, because even though the anime doesn't excel particularly in any aspect besides the enjoyment, the enjoyment category is the only one that really matters. If you don't like the anime, the best story or characters won't mean anything. It is because of the overall package and enjoyment that, at least I got out of the anime, the anime gets the sore it does.

    The sequel to Higurashi. Less killing and more speeches? Does it work out? In the end, yes. It's just a lot of pain to get to there. 
 
Kai continues the story of Higurashi, but instead of showing more arcs of everyone going insane and murdering each other, it concentrates more on solving why the mysterious events in Higurashi happen and put an end to them. Minus the first one, the arcs are much longer than they were, and the story has Rika as the main character instead of Keiichi. 
 
The story? I don't know. You see, for me, Higurashi Kai has the worst arc of the show, hands down. The Massacre arc, the second arc after the 4 episode first one (which is probably my second-least favorite) is just terrible. Every episode is compromised of over 5 minutes of the same, dull speeches on how, by working together, you can overcome fate and create a miracle! Not to mention the fact that it's so slowly paced. The show more or less just waltz around not getting anything really accomplished for half of the arc. Fortunately, the final arc picks up the pace. While what happens in it is extremely stupid, it is well-executed enough that I can look beyond that. The background given to the show is very interesting. 
 
However, on the whole, does Kai provide a good ending for the show? Oh no. There's still so many things that have yet to be explained (such as the whole first arc of the series makes little sense still), and there's also several plot holes too. While they are easy to ignore and you might not even notice them if you don't think, if you do realize them, then it really lowers the quality of the show a bit. Also, the last like, 2 minutes of this make no sense whatsoever, but it doesn't really affect the plot, so it's rather easy to ignore. 
 
The characters. Hm... Kai concentrates more on Rika, which is fine and all, she's a good character. However, the other main characters? They don't get much. You see, in normal mood the cast of Higurashi is vaguely pleasant and all, but none really stand out. It's when they go into crazy mood where they become the awesome characters they are, and they never really have a chance to go into crazy mood. They don't really even do much besides give speeches and offer some abilities to help save the day in the end. Rika does do a decent enough job pulling along the show by herself ot make up for it, but it's still a disappointment. 
 
The animation? It is better than the original (not like that's tough to do, though). Everyone actually manages to stay on model for the majority of the show. Well, minus the time they forgot to draw Mion's arm, but still. It's still obviously a low-budget show, just not obviously low-budget. The animation can get rather nice when it wants to, which is typically about once an episode. It's still pretty bad, but not as bad. 
 
The music is the same as last season. Two great opening and endings, great voice actors, and a background track that doesn't stand out, but still adds to the mood. 
 
This is a must-watch if you saw the original Higurashi season. While the first was better, Kai is not only necessary to understand the plot, but does some notable stuff on its own too. Do not watch this without viewing the original Higurashi though. You will be completely lost. I give Higurashi Kai 7 stars and say that you should watch it.

    Overview: 
 
There are certain opinions that are accepted on MAL, and certain opinions that stir up lots of anger. Certain anime series can't be praised and others can't be criticized without creating an absolute hailstorm of ""unhelpfuls"". I don't mean to come across as a mean spirited contrarian and kick any sacred cows, but I have to be honest. This is one of my least favorite anime comedy series. I don't think I laughed once the entire time. That's an accomplishment! I'm pretty easy to make laugh. YES, I understand that the director intended the series to parody the crass stupidity of American comedy and show what American comedy feels like to a Japanese audience. The problem is that this is NOT a good parody/spoof of American stupidity. It is just a very lazy and totally ineffectual copy of it. Mike Judge's Idiocracy with the short ""film"" OW My Balls! was a parody. Panty and Stocking is just like watching a bottom 50% episode of Family Guy or a bottom 10% episode of South Park where Trey and Matt are really off their game that week. I don't actually hate Hiroyuki Imaishi and I KNOW that he can do better, but this series simply wasn't one of his best efforts. 
 
Plot and character: 2/10:  
 
There is no real engaging plot obviously. The basic premise is that 2 naughty girl angels get kicked out of Heaven and must use lingerie items as weapons in order to fight ghosts and eventually buy their way back into heaven with the requisite number of award points. To be frank, the plot to Ren and Stimpy was better than this! Panty and Stocking is highly episodic in nature and each episode is as painfully unfunny as the last. The characters are insanely obnoxious, unfunny, and have none of the appeal of the characters in South Park, Family Guy, or any of the shows that this allegedly is spoofing. This is NOT coming from someone who thinks Family Guy is a well written show BTW. I HATE Family Guy! I just happen to hate Panty and Stocking a LOT more. Why? Because Family Guy can on very rare occasion still make me laugh, unlike this giant shit monster! Did anyone else think the Giant Shit Monster in episode 1 was an allusion to the show itself? The thought certainly crossed MY mind. 
 
Art: 6/10 
 
The art is actually pretty decent. It is a long way from the best Gainax is capable of, but it is clearly the highlight of the series for what its worth. 
 
Enjoyment: 1/10 
 
There are few things in life worse than sitting through a comedy that's extremely unfunny. This is like watching a version of ""Meet the Spartans"" that lasts for 6 hours! 
 
Overall: 3/10 
 
So what could this series have done differently? Could it have been saved and remade to actually be funny? The answer to this previous question is YES! Panty and Stocking has plenty of potential, but it was highly flawed in its execution. Firstly, the 2 main characters are simply WAY too annoying. It is acceptable to have a comedy with a fairly annoying protagonist, but there is a certain line in the sand where once you cross it, the comedy becomes un-watchable. This is why nobody liked The Love Guru, Freddy Got Fingered, or Biodome. If the characters just grate on your every nerve, 100% of the time they are on screen, it stops being funny and starts becoming an absolute chore to watch. Secondly, Panty and Stocking really needed to better develop its own sense of humor, more like Imaishi's other works Gurren Lagann and Inferno Cop. There is a difference between ""homage"", ""spoof"", and lazy ripoff. This felt like a lazy ripoff. Lastly, Imaishi's high energy absurdist humor can quickly begin to wear on the viewer's nerves. Much like Seth McFarland's style of comedy, it can be decent in small doses and VERY annoying in large doses. Panty and Stocking would have massively benefited from having much shorter episodes in the style of Imaishi's later work Inferno Cop. 
 
TLDR: If you want a goofy Hiroyuki Imaishi anime, please skip this one and go watch Inferno Cop instead. You will be very glad you did!

    You ever see one of those places that makes fast food items but does them really fancy and gourmet? (Yes, this is an Anime review, just stick with me for a bit.) They make burgers and fries, but instead of using passable and cheap ingredients, they put time, effort, and resources into their product and make something that resembles what you see at a chain franchise, but after you've eaten it realize it's so much more than that. That is what Sunrise's ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is. A great Anime disguised as a garden variety mech.  
 
Any great TV show, movie, etc. is gonna rely on a great story and great characters. This has both. In an alternate universe, in 2010, Japan gets conquered by the Holy Empire of Britannia. Re-named ""Area 11"" and is subjugated to a new, tyrannical rule by a bunch of fancy, pompous, bad guys with royal titles and really over the top outfits. These guys are easy to hate. Naturally, a rebellion starts up. Rag tag heroes we can easily get behind. Both sides use mechs (called Knightmare Frames) as primary weapons, but they are not the center of the story and the end all, be all of winning the battle like most other shows. The characters are the money. Lelouch, our titular character who is suddenly endowed with a magical power to will anyone to obey his commands, commands our attention as a master tactician even without his ability. Kururugi, torn between loyalties to country and those he is sworn to serve, easy to empathize with. Kallen, the endearing, bad ass resistance chick who also provides most of the fan service in the show, those are just 3 of what is a very rich cast with good depth of character to each of them.  
 
The writing in this show utilizes this cast and provides some of the best story telling and plot twists I have seen this side of ""Death Note"" all while giving us great scenes of combat with giant robots for those who need a fix of that sweet, sweet, 'splosion porn. This is all beautifully done with some gorgeous art and character designs that are bright, vibrant, and colorful providing a good contrast to the nightmare of war that so often surrounds them. My only complaint being they are too long and lanky in some ways, can somebody get these guys a sandwich? I realize war doesn't add meat to bones, but not everyone in this show needs to look like a scarecrow. I digress. You put all of it together and you have a new standard for greatness for the mech genre.  
 
While I adore this series on the whole, some things did bother me, and one is too much time putzing around in (you guessed it) A *BLEEPING* HIGH SCHOOL!!! It's a prestigious academy, etc, where all these teenagers would naturally meet and interact, so it makes sense as a plot device, but we spend much too much time here doing event planning and Character X has a crush on Character Y. As good as the writing is, some of the subplots are too drawn out and the cat and mouse game of when will this character learn the truth about this other character, which they inevitably do, gets tiresome when you know it's going to happen at some point. Even with this however, the 24 episode season is immensely binge worthy and these speed bumps do little to harm the pace of plot.  
 
Sub vs. Dub time. This was a tough one. I must admit. But, I really like the English dub better than the Japanese cast. Mainly because Johnny Yong Bosch gives the performance of his career as Lelouch. With this he has forever separated himself from the ""Power Rangers"" franchise and establishes himself as one of the premier voice actors in the English dub world. The rest of the cast is hit or miss at times, but he makes it all worth it. Top the rest of the ear driven experience off with great sound effects and a very good score in the show (I found the opening and closing credits music to be basic and skippable) and you have a complete experience for the senses.   
 
My personal journey into this show was like most others, word of mouth, ""This is great! You should watch it."" I saw commercials with big robots blowing stuff up. Sounds good, looks good, okay- I tuned in one day and I saw our main character chasing a cat who had run off with his helmet. ""Okay, this is a waste of time..."" was my reaction and I moved on to other things. After giving the show a proper watch, I realized how wrong I was and how I had walked in at one of the silliest scenes possible. This show inspires interest and gets you emotionally invested all while being supremely entertaining. This is everything one could ask for in an Anime and more than you could ever expect from a show with giant robots. This show is fantastic. Not perfect, but damn close. 8/10. Check it out. Cheers!

    Fairy Tail 2014 is the sequel to the original Fairy Tail anime that aired from 2009-2013. It's actually an upgrade in many ways from the previous anime despite having a shaky beginning with their budget it seems (Early episodes have varying quality throughout). Let's just be clear, this is still the same Fairy Tail everyone knows and loves.  
 
Story: I think a lot of the problems people have with the 2014 series is that the beginning of it is the second half of the Grand Magic Games (Which for whatever reason is the most critically panned non filler arc of the series, so it being the first arc affects people's ratings) and then it goes straight into a filler arc afterwards. I agree, it's unfortunate the sequel anime to the original Fairy Tail got shackled by 2 arcs in a row that ""most"" people didn't like (I actually loved the Grand Magic Games, but understand I'm in the minority).  
 
Recently however, the anime has been on track to reclaiming its former greatness. Adapting the popular sidestory omake chapters and starting the Tartarus (or Tarataros) arc have seen the budget and artwork increase, and storywise the series has never been better. This arc is pretty much the epitome of greatness concerning Hiro Mashima's writing. Each of the main cast members get something awesome to do in this arc, and it features some of the best plot twists in the series. 
 
10/10 
 
Art: Even if the earlier episodes were filled with inconsistent artwork, the DVD releases actually fix up a lot of noticeable problems, so for the sake of my review I'll use those redone episodes as the basis and the current quality of the Tartarus arc. While the first anime made things too colorful and purposely avoided blood, Fairy Tail 2014 takes that darker step and makes the color palette closer to the original manga, and even adds blood into scenes! (There could be more blood though, but that's just a nitpick at best. It's still better the original Fairy Tail in that regard). 
 
9/10 
 
Sound: The sound track for the series continues to be superb. While some of the original tracks from the first Fairy Tail do make reappearances as remixed versions of themselves, most of the OST in this series is brand new. The Tartarus arc especially has some great new darker themes (With demon chanting) that definitely sets the mood, on top of having the soul pumping kickass main theme when main characters kick ass. 
 
10/10 
 
Characters: Oh boy, where Fairy Tail has always shined is its cast of characters and the 2014 series is no exception. You have your main 5 cast members from the previous series returning: Natsu, Erza, Gray, Lucy, and Wendy. Then you have all the various side characters from their guild and all the other guilds. Every character gets a chance to shine, and it's hard to not have a favorite in a show where so many characters get ample amounts of screentime. Certain characters, like Gray, especially have seen some major development and focus in the 2014 series due to certain story sequences, more so than he did in the original Fairy Tail anime.  
 
10/10 
 
Enjoyment: Definitely love watching Fairy Tail each week with my friends and family. We have come a long way from getting still frames, magic circles, and reused battle animation to where we are now. I would even go as far to say that now the animated action clearly outshines the manga.   
 
10/10 
 
Overall: In conclusion, I have to say that Fairy Tail 2014 has surpassed the old series in nearly every category. It really annoyed me that so many people were rating this series 4s and 5s based off just watching the first few episodes but not waiting to see how this adaptation would turn out. I'm hoping many people find my review helpful and that it encourages them to watch to at least the Tartarus arc to see if they'll like the new series or not. Fairy Tail 2014 gets a 10/10 overall.

    I wasn't expecting this to be so great (mostly because I had never heard of this anime when it was recommended to me), but after watching the first episode, I was hooked. The characters are all lovable, even the villains, and the way the story slowly reveals itself just makes you keep wanting more. I kept finding myself watching episode after episode into the wee hours in the morning, telling myself I'd just watch one more, but watching another after that and another after that. And the ending? Many things happened that I didn't expect, I was left pleasantly surprised. I was very happy with the ending, and the entire anime overall. I highly recommend this anime, as long as you don't mind some (a lot of) animated blood.

    I'll get this issue out of the way first: 
 
When an anime is an adaption of a manga, simulator, et al; there's a guaranteed chance that only a small number of people had seen the story outside of the recently-created anime.  So sometimes, there's a need for said anime to be its own monster. 
 
Hence this title. 
 
""Softenni"" is basically what KyotoAnimu, and their boot-licker otaku-base, didn't want K-on to be: an animu about cute girls doing anything other than cute things.  Like wearing either their undies or thin air, having the skirts get robbed of their ""magical"" properties, allowing (God-Forbid) actually useful and skillful shounens within the same spotlights and time-frames. 
 
Now comes my tried-and-true litmus test: ""The Shounen's Survival Rate In A Brutal Pink Bishoujo Ghetto."" 
 
I have no qualms against Mishimagi.  But I do have some issues against Leo, manager of the rival girls' soft tennis club.  He's an expert masseuse; but (because it's a PBG) he still gets treated harshly, he's voiced by a female voice actress, AND he even crossdresses as a girl. 
 
I nearly threw this animu into the for-otaku garbage can if it wasn't so colorful, so funny, written with an ounce of actual consistency, and filled with upskirt panchira. 
 
(Actually showing an ounce of heart and restraint, because of the recent natural disasters that affected Japan, was a major plus IMMHO.  But hey. :P )

    Do you ever have that one anime where you feel as though there was many things going on but still feeling like there was no impact to any of it? Anime that are of the action genre often come into this dilemma. Ones that have an overarching story that tries to make it grand and epic, only to squander it by not giving much to go on. It doesn’t help with a short 12-13 episode season. Considering that Owari no Seraph had a 2nd season in the same year in order to facilitate its story longer and still come off short is basically rubbing salt in the wound. 
 
To go back on the first season for a bit, since I never reviewed it, my initial impression of the story was incredibly underwhelming. I thought the way it told a revenge plot involving a boy who wants to kill vampires who killed all of his friends was too simple and drab for me to take seriously. There are ways in which this could work but with Owari no Seraph’s case it comes across as predictable and hamfisted with the melodrama. Not only is the story itself nothing special, but the way it is presented is all over the place. Most notably the pacing is what drags it down so low. There are many places where the plot just rushes along in order to get to the next battle scene without any semblance of exposition to tell the audience what exactly is going on. This is very apparent in the last episode of this season where the last ten minutes felt like there should’ve been two more episodes to fill in to make it feel more like a seamless transition from scene to scene. 
 
Writing is the key point to any story as well, and Owari no Seraph has probably the most boring dialogue of any shounen anime this year. It’s like the running joke in America where we think of Hollywood of just reusing cliched catchphrases we see in countless action blockbusters by putting there hand in a jar and pick whatever line is on a piece of paper. That’s what it feels like for some of the lines that lean on the “edgy” or “melodramatic” nature of Owari no Seraph. Many of the lines, even if you’re watching with the worst fansubs or know a little Japanese like I do, just reek of stale dialogue writing that even a high school student with a novice level of writing composition could do better. They can range from predictable to groan inducing on many occasions. 
 
Unfortunately, most of the characters here are of the same level as the story is in terms of quality. They all fall under the category of forgettable and flat, with the exception of one character that is the one ray of sunshine of this entire anime. The character I am referring to is the lovely sarcastic lady,  Shinoa Hiiragi. Although her character development is on par to the rest of the bland cast, her snarky demeanor and voiced wonderfully by Saori Hayami, who does her lines a cut above the rest. Without her, I don’t think I would’ve sat through all 24 episodes of season 1 and 2; in fact I would say the only reason I bothered to continue this was just to see more of Shinoa. Her presence in season 2 is just as good, albeit a little more serious than in the previous one which kind of disappointed me but I’ll take whatever Shinoa I can get at this point. 
 
Yuu proves himself to be the stereotypical edgy protagonist who shouts most of his lines and blurts out predictable vengeful lines and promises to stick with his friends lines. Admittedly, I do think Mika, Yuu’s other friend who gets turned towards the vampire side, was probably the least bad out of the suck bunch in the cast. Only because he at least had a role that was kind of captivating to see where he has to battle out his friend’s other friends in order to reunite with him. In fact, all three of these characters are the only ones I even remember. As much as I rag on Yuu’s character, at least I can remember his name and the dumb lines he spout out. You could quiz me on the rest of the characters and I will guarantee you that I would not make more than a 20% grade percentage. This being the problem of how so little development any of them have despite being in the same armed forces as Yuu and Shinoa or the vampire clan they are fighting against. The only thing we have to go on is that they are fighting an enemy that threatens their way of life, that’s about it. Whoopee. 
 
It is weird to analyze the technical prowess of Owari no Seraph because I do love the artwork of the characters and even some of the backgrounds look nice to look at. However the animation is very hit or miss. No where is this more evident than in the fighting scenes where there are some episodes where the animation just takes a nose dive and seems so obvious that the animators were cutting corners, possibly due to budgeting issues or whatnot. When it isn’t at such low quality, it is serviceable to the eyes and compliments the artwork. Other than the animation being a mixed bag, I genuinely love how colorful the characters look. As a matter of fact, if the characters didn’t have very distinct colorful features to their hair or skin, I think my opinion of them being forgettable would be even lower than it is. 
 
Vampires and humans battling out each other can be something fun on paper but rarely has there been any that succeed in reality. Had the writers took their time to develop the characters and story slowly for me to get a sense of the world, I think this could’ve been pretty good. What I got out of Owari no Seraph after finishing its 2nd season was just the biggest meh that has ever meh this year of 2015. All I got out of it was more Shinoa fanart to gaze upon with my own eyes. At least great things can come from average places. 
 
Grade: C-

    Okay let me just say without a doubt this is one of the better anime that i have seen so far and got me interested in the 'yandere' characters by introducing the queen of yandere Yuno  Gasai. the story starts off as the main character Yuki Amano getting a diary (which is his cell phone) that could tell him future events hints the name of the title being future diary, but what he doesn't know is that he is being put into one of the most dangerous games of his life.  
This Anime had its creepy moments( What's not creepy about a girl that stalks you) and gross moments( i will not say) the story is just one of those stories that you cant stop watching till the end.

    WOW watched an anime movie after a long time! And just pointing out, the summary on the main page is not consistent in the contents and isnt convincing enough for attracting more viewers to see the moie.Okay some thoughts on the movie overall: 
 
Story [7/10]: The story starts with a girl named Asuna who meets a boy named Shun. He comes from a distant land named Agartha (actually the underworld as its refered to as in the story- though a very beautiful one). He saved Asuna from one of the creatures which had surfaced from that land. They quickly become friends. But soon he disappers (dies). After his disappearance Asuna come to learn about Agartha once again in her school during a lecture from a teacher. She investigates more by reading and also consults the teacher who mentioned about it in class.A series of quick events leads Asuna and the teacher to travel through Agartha. The rest of the story chronicles the experiences of Asuna and the teacher through the land and the purpose of their travel are revelaed. Its a fantasy story ofcourse so things outerworldly were expected. Just that the movie doesnt quiet elaborate on it smoothly. I mean there are gaps and sudden jumps so its a bit hard to sometimes digest why the characters are acting the way they are acting. But overall it wasnt as bad either. Concept of travel though underworld was interesting enough and could have been developed more. Maybe the manga will elaboarte more. 
 
Art [10/10]: I am giving this section a full 10 only for the breathtaking sceneries shown throughout the movie. The colours are soft and how to say maybe lucid. Yeah each landscape is like a masterpiece. The mountains, meadows, the skies in particular (I guess the director must really like looking at the sky- both daytime and night time) are just to grand and wonderful. The way the sunrays falling on the ground are pictured in every scene are too good. For the human figures- they were okay I guess. The way they were drawn reminded me of typical ghibli movie human figures. Creature of the underworld have been modelled mostly on different dinosaurs from what i could make out by watching. Other modern day animals were nicely drawn. 
 
Sound [7/10]: All voice actors have done excellent jobs and expressed emotions aptly. A bit disappointed in the music cause it was not too audible in the first place. Or maybe I have just missed it cause I was awestruck by the landscaping >.

    Spoilerless Review 
 
Story: It's a great story. You got to stomach through the cringe science explanation. P.S. Just accept and move on. 
 
Art: Character looks typical. but decent enough to move the narrative forward. Else its good. 
 
Sound: Everything here just fits. I can't seem to find any flaws here. 
 
Character: The only reason you should watch the show. 
 
Enjoyment: Watched at least thrice each episode, still enjoyed it mostly. 
 
Overall: SeishunButaYarou anime is one of the more realistic stories out there, if there is any of realism that exist in anime. The plots might be a bit cliched but if you can let it pass, I am sure you will enjoy this anime. =D

    that was pretty good, not as good as Adventure 02,Tamers and Xros Wars which are my favorites but i think it's better than savers and as good as Adventure and Frontier 
The story is fine, it has very interesting points and it's educative sometimes talking about the effect of I.A on our daily lives  
*Spoiler* 
I didn't like the protagonist but he got a nice ending starting to study A.I and everything 
*End of spoiler* 
Liked a lot the other characters like Eri,Astra and Rei, loved their histories. 
Didn't like the Songs, the first opening was nice but the second was pretty lame and the only thing that kept me hyped for the evolutions was Haru's Grandpa funny voice 
Art is good and i loved the designs they remind me of Yokai Watch i think that's why people say it's Digimon trying to copy Yokai Watch, the digimons on this one at least on their initial forms resemble humans instead of animals like in previous seasons 
enjoyed watching it overall

    I love yaoi, I admit it, but I like it when the story involves adults, not childs or in this case a child and a pedophile.  I cannot accept or tolerate pedophilia and that is what Boku no Pico is. 
After I watched that i felt dirty, disgusted, inmoral, bad.  
First of all: is his grandfather an idiot, is he selling the kid or he just does not give a F about his grandchild? Why he suggest that the pedophile and Boku be friends is he blind or insane? 
Second: Tamotsu should be in jail.  
Third: It is just horrible, child pornography is a crime. 
So that is MY OPINION.

    This review will encompass the K-On franchise as a whole. 
 
Introduction: When I decided to watch K-On, I wasn’t expecting much. I had seen the memes of the main character, Yui Hirasawa and her friends acting cute and bumming around. I had heard that K-On was the phenomenon that popularized the concept of “moe” in anime and spread its influence further, corrupting the modern industry, and giving it its odd infatuation with the premise of “cute girls doing cute things”, something that has had an iron grip on anime as a whole as of late. While I personally do not hold great disdain for this “genre” - if you will - I will admit that I’m not the biggest fan of it and would rather watch an anime that centres around character development and a deep, entrancing story. Now, why did I start to watch K-On? The answer is rather simple; I wanted a show that was filled to the brim with happiness after I completed the rather depressing anime known as Paranoia Agent. What I got instead was an anime that was very bitter-sweet, and filled with characters that I personally cared about.  
 
Story (9/10): If one were to take K-On’s story at face value, it would not be interesting in the slightest. It’s been done countless of times before. A student who had just entered high school joins an odd club and establishes friendships that last her a lifetime. This kind of story has been etched into our collective consciousness, and whenever we sit down to watch anime that holds this premise, we can foresee the development of its plot points far before they actually unfold on the screen before us. However, the strength of K-On’s story does not lay in its cliche premise, but rather in its heartfelt execution. Unlike many high-school dramas, K-On follows its characters as they grow and mature (or not) over the course of their three years in school. During this period of time, we watch as Yui Hirasawa, originally an unmotivated girl on a collision course with a NEET lifestyle, grow talented in music, and we see her create eternal bonds with her fellow club members. The denizens of the Light Music Club face everyday issues such as exams and concerts, but the most harrowing of these issues is the problem of growing up. And this fact of life is the central theme of K-On’s story, and it is a theme that is seldom touched upon in slice-of-life anime. We all experience growing old, the separation from childhood friends, and the eventual acceptance that our youthful innocence and naivety does not last forever. As such, K-On’s story is immediately relatable. The emotions of the girls in the Light Music Club are conveyed with such realism as they confront with this inevitable reality, and it is genuinely heart-breaking as we watch with them contend with this issue. I can confidently say that the latter half of K-On is one of the most bitter sweet moments in anime, period. It evoked more emotions in me than notorious sad anime such as Clannad and Your Lie in April because the characters were relatable, but I’ll get to that in the next section. On a side note, K-On’s humour is top-notch and certainly evoked at least a chuckle or two from me each episode. I also applaud K-On for not relying on fanservice for its humour. That is extremely rare for an anime with an all-female cast, so kudos to them. 
 
Characters(8/10): K-On’s characters are generally what one would expect from a slice-of-life anime involving cute girls and music. Yui Hirasawa is your classic airhead who delights in eating sweets all day and gawking at cute things. Ritsu Tainaka is the boyish (and forgetful) drummer who takes great satisfaction in teasing her friends and playing relatively harmless pranks around the school. Mio Akiyama is the bassist for the band, and despite her best efforts to maintain a cool exterior, on the inside she is very fearful and shy. Tsumugi Kotobuki is the keyboardist and ditzy member of the band. She grew up rich, and is ignorant to many of the customs of common folk. Finally, we have Azusa Nakano, who is the youngest of the band, and yet she is also the most strict. From this brief summary, one can surmise that K-On’s characters aren’t exactly original. That is true, though, the greatest impact of K-On’s characters is how human they feel. When we see a snapshot of their daily lives in each episode, we feel as if we are right alongside them as they partake in their antics. Almost every main character feels realistically like a person you would meet on the street, each with their own quirks, strengths and weaknesses. While Yui may be an airhead and probably a victim of ADD, she works hard when it counts and cares deeply for her friends. Ritsu may appear to be a unintelligent jerk from the outside, but in reality she holds deep affection for her friends and she succeeds when it counts. Mio is very smart and beautiful, though she suffers greatly from anxiety, and despite this, she tries again and again to fight it so that she may play on stage without fear. Azusa is strong-willed and is very skilled at guitar, and yet she has such a great attachment to her seniors that it is almost damaging to her psyche, and so she does everything she can to cope with their inevitable graduation. Unfortunately, I could not find any substantial flaws in Tsumugi’s character. She succeeds at everything, she is beautiful, and she is talented. I hate to say it, but Tsumugi is very well the Mary-Sue of this story. Whether that is intentional or not, I cannot say. Nonetheless, she is a likeable character all the same. 
 
Art(9/10): K-On is beautifully animated, no questions asked. The backgrounds are bright and full of colour. The school is well defined as a location. The main characters are all well designed, and their appearances are memorable. K-On’s animation shines the brightest during the scenes when the girls are playing their instruments. Every character’s finger movements match up to the beat of the music, which is especially thrilling when you see Yui or Azusa’s fingers on their guitar strings match the fast-paced grooves of the song they’re playing. All in all, there is not much to complain about when it comes to K-On’s animation, except for some minor nitpicking. Some character faces do look the same but with different hair, and many of the background characters are dull and not very interesting. The artstyle does get a substantial upgrade in the movie, however. London is beautifully animated, and the characters themselves are very crisp and pleasing to the eye. The best part about the animation in the movie, in my opinion, is how each character’s facial expressions are greatly defined. They really bring out each character’s personality and help convey their reactions to the events unfolding around them with fantastic detail.  
 
Sound(8/10): The music of K-On is perhaps the most controversial section of the anime. I’ll begin with the stock background music. It fits each scene, though it is not particularly memorable and I don’t think I’ll go back to listen to the anime’s soundtrack anytime soon. Next up, the openings and endings. I found the opening from season one and the first opening of season two to be catchy and enjoyable, but unfortunately, the opening for the second half of season two was a tad ear-grating and I did end up continually skipping it after I heard it for the first time. All three endings were just find, though I did not listen to them more than once each. The main cast’s seiyuu all did fantastic work and beautifully captured their respective character’s emotions and mannerisms, which in turn made them feel even more alive alongside the exceptional writing. Nodoka’s seiyuu could’ve used some work, as her voice cracked now and again, but that’s very minor. And now, onto the main songs he bands played. Overall, I enjoyed them. I found them all to be fun to listen to, and one track in particular at the end of the series is a real tear-jerker. Yui’s voice fits the tone of each song, and I did not find her voice to be irritating at all. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10): Every episode of K-On was hands-down fun to watch. I loved the story, character interactions, and seeing how the story of the Light Music Club would progress. It was touching to see the characters age over the course of their high school years, and how they would eventually come to terms with growing old. As I watched K-On, I really grew attached to this lovable cast of characters because their issues were relatable and very human. K-On is one of the few anime that is able to make me laugh and cry from beginning to end. 
 
Conclusion: Behind K-On’s seemingly cliche exterior lays a surprisingly poignant story about growing up and coming to terms with the fact that nothing lasts forever. Alongside a bright artstyle, rockin’ music, and memorable characters, K-On is one anime you’ll surely remember for years to come.

    story: 9/10 
 
This is the last season and it is the shortest of all, and although it is my second favorite, it haves the BEST story and it is the best well written of all. It's also the most tragic and dark of all. 
 
art: 8/10 
 
the art improved a lot especially if you look at sailor's eyes. they are all very stylized and (maybe) mature. 
i loved eternal sailor moon desing and their wings, but maybe they have to be really unconfortable to fight, especially because they aren't real wings to fly, they are just for decoration. 
 
sound: 7/10 
 
openings and endings themes are one of my most favourites themes for the whole series between nineties and crystal. 
when i was more little the ""sad version"" of the opening made me sometimes want to cry. 
 
character: 8/10 
 
As always all the characters are still charming and charismatic. 
tuxedo mask does not appear on this season, since he goes to the US to study, and i his place appear a 3 new senshi called sailor star lights who came from out of the solar system. 
My favourite of them is sailor star healer. Outer senshi retun in their super sailor forms; and returns my favourite senshi Saturn!! in super sailor senshi form too. 
Galaxia, is the best desinged villain of all the previous ones. 
 
About the sailor animamates who serves Galaxia, they all had very cool, original and stylized desings; but my favorite is Sailor Iron Mouse. 
 
enjoyment: 9/10 
 
overall: 9/10 
 
i can't wait to see how it whould be the story and charaters desings in crystal/eternal

    A life of endless failures, a life of endless problems, surely such things will break someone, until..that is, you meet a girl who's obsessed with skipping on exams by tricking people and telling them she's sick, so she could stay at home imagining about dumplings, eating black bean buns and be a burden to her parents all the time. 
 
The story itself is amazing, very heartwarming and very sad at the same time. The protagonist flaws is what makes it more believable, there is no such thing as a flawless person, even in anime. 
 
Well, rarely.... 
 
In all seriousness, Clannad is a very immersive anime, it will suck you in for it's unique take on the Visual novel adaptation thing. There's just minor flaws with this anime, such as..where are the other heroins when an arc started till it ends?  
 
Also do.not.attempt.to.play.the special visual novel.....i repeat....do not...do it...

    Since I'm a musician I always give a try to those animes based on music themes, and this one is no exception, and maybe the best... music itself gives a lead to the storyline, that connects the characters, 5 girls who live in a kind of forgotten military outpost in the mountains... 
The past and the present are mixed up through the sound of the bugle, legend and history have their own melodies in their every day life, which is a quite simple routine, although very emotional...  
The art concept is warm and clean, the story as well as the environment  have an attractive mood, characters are compelling with strong personalities and the sound, oh the sound... it goes on with you after you see every episode... good music is always powerful... 
this is a very unique anime... 
enjoy...

    Kill La Kill may be an anime that you wouldn't watch with your parents. And especially would get you weird looks from non-anime fans. But to the less judging eye, it comes out as a great show, that may have a few worn edges. 
 
Story: 6/fair 
I can not talk much about the story on it's own without spoiling a lot of the plot. But for what I can say, I will speak this: the plot and story arcs of Kill La Kill are the most lacking of all it's major assets.  It starts of normal with a to-cool-for-school, punk rock young girl just on a journey around Japan looking for her father's murderer when it leads her back to her hometown. That story goes on for a little over 10 episodes, and I only wish it stuck with it. After the half-way point of the season the plot goes towards every conceivable solution to the original problem that they could find. It was like the writers had all gotten drunk the night they were writing the other 12 episodes and decided to stick with it after the fact. The plot becomes so convoluted that you feel that you are only witnessing the thoughts and dreams of what one of the characters thought the future would entail. Don't get me wrong, there are many good moments in this anime, from surprise betrayals to even magnifying team-ups. But most of that juicy, meaty goodness found in a story that all anime lovers adore is mostly found in the back-half. Just a little to late for most people. 
 
Art: 9/great 
What Kill La Kill lacks in writing and story-telling, it completely makes up for in every other category, especially art. To start, this is one of the most beautiful anime I have every seen. I mean just look at the poster itself, it entices your eyes from the beginning. That art styling is also held the entire way through action and battle sequences. The highlighted neon colors of the characters clothing, weapons, and action all culminate into something that you must let your eyes feast on for hours. It is truly a very unique experience, and I have never seen anything like it before. 
 
Sound: 7/good 
Music, an integral part of every anime, making up a cornerstone of why it is liked so much. Kill La Kill delivers on its sound design, always having there composers choose the exact time to lay down a sick beat or two in the middle of a hair-raising battle. Right when you hear the howl of ""DON'T LOSE YOUR WAY!"" you know your in for a good moment and turn around in the outcome of the fight. The opening and closing of the first half of the season are much more superior than that of the last twelve. With the implement of a pounding drum set in the first opener, you always get excited for what is coming next. The major thing that is lacking in the music and sound department is the scarceness of any good non-action music. I can barely remember any sounds that were used outside the battle sequences, and that becomes a little off putting after a while. When they hit the mark though, they hit dead center. 
 
Character: 7/good 
Kill La Kill has a large variety of characters, from comedic dunces to ultra-unlikeable villains, the show has everything for anyone's taste. Between the main characters: Ryuuko, Satsuki, Mako, and my personal favorite Senketsu, they become more fleshed-out and likable by the end of the series. You start to grow feelings towards them like all great anime characters. But once we get to the supporting cast, it gets a little harder to find any good apples. For example, the elite 4 were a good set of characters, and were fun to watch and interact with. However, the only one that got the most screen time was Gamagoori, and was also the only one that changed throughout the course of the show. The rest of Mako's family are all mostly tropes, and ""NUDIST BBBEEEAAACCCHHH!!"" are just there to be there. Ragyou and Nui are some nice heels and villains, but there motives are so over-the-top you can't appreciate them for who they are. Besides the main four cast members, the list of characters is mostly barren of good talent for this anime. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/great 
Kill La Kill may not be the show stopper that ""Saved Anime"" like it is being touted as, but it was still a barrel of laughs and a hell of a lot of fun. I was always waiting to get another free moment to watch the next episode in the line and learn more about this fantastical world these characters live in. It was very fun watching them interact with each other, have unique experiences, and watching them duke it out. Many an anime fan will enjoy this next amazing home run by Studio Trigger, as much as I did.

    _Honey and Clover_ was odd. I *wanted* to like it, but for some reason it just struck me as mediocre. I was going to leave it at 7, but I thought the final episodes developed Takemoto's character at least a little, and I was deeply amused by the comedy interlude episodes ('Ham-senpai!'); as well, I have a lingering fondness for the visual elegance & music of the first ED. I'd like to see where the characters go, so I'll watch season 2.

    Like most of the community, I was watching Sword Art Online whilst it was airing about four or five years ago, and I remember how everyone collectively became more and more disappointed with the show as it was airing. Not only was the show's pacing completely out of control with constant time skips amongst many other glaring issues during the first half, the show practically imploded in on itself during the horrendous second arc, which only left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth. At the time, I hated the show, and still do to a certain extent now, but my main thought was that, at the very least, Sword Art Online couldn't get any worse... right? Unfortunately, I was proven wrong since the second season of Sword Art Online proved to be even worse, becoming one of the worst anime I have ever had the displeasure of consuming in my entire life. While there are perhaps one or two elements of the show that is worthy of praise, the negatives far outweigh the positives and this review will be tackling all three arcs in order while practically spoiling every event in the show, so take that as a warning if you're planning to watch this anime at some point. With all of that out of the way, let's jump into the Phantom Bullet arc! 
 
PHANTOM BULLET ARC (1/10): 
 
This arc is one of the worst story arcs I have ever seen. What could have been an interesting look into the mental state and psyche of Kirito, just becomes an aimless mess with no sense of direction, followed by glaring pacing issues and awful characters as well as a terrible villain. This arc does so much wrong that's insanely annoying to watch and I constantly wanted to consume cyanide during my viewing to taste the sweet, sweet relief of death. The second season of SAO takes place a year after the events of the first season and opens up with Kirito and Asuna on a date, happily reminiscing about their time in Sword Art Online. Y'know... that place where thousands of people met their horrible demise? Perhaps they view the entire experience as some sort of romantic honeymoon or something. Anyway, whilst on this date, Kirito is asked by some government dude if he could speak to him about some strange incidences involving the massively popular game known as ""Gun Gale Online"". Government-kun tells Kirito-sama that in this game, a player has been able to successively kill other plays in the game, resulting in their real-life deaths. The viewer learns of this player, called ""Death Gun"" from the opening scene of the show. Not only is the character design a lesser version of Darth Vader, but the name ""Death Gun"" just seems silly and stupid. A gun's primary use is that of a weapon; to kill people and bring about death. So, I guess the gun is double the death then...? I guess it does make sense in the context of the show since this ""double death gun"" does result in the avatar and the real-life death of the person controlling said avatar, but the name does seem a little silly for someone trying to be so intimidating and feels more like a cheap knock off, of the Death Note than anything else. 
 
Anyway, Government-kun asks Kirito-sama if he will work with him by going inside Gun Gale Online to try and put a stop to Death Gun, and, after some reluctance at first, Kirito agrees and the rest of the arc sees Kirito attempting to find out Death Gun's true identity. Now, this sounds fine on paper, but the execution for this arc is terrible. First of all, let's discuss Kirito's character and the HUGE waste in potential this anime throws out the window in regards to his PTSD. At some point in the show, while Kirito is about to enter a tournament in the game (I'll get to the specifics of this in a bit) we learn that Death Gun was a part of a group called ""Laughing Coffin"" in Sword Art Online; a group that Kirito and Asuna fought and was forced to kill some of their members. This triggers Kirito's PTSD and this is easily one of the most interesting things that have ever happened to his character since he actually exhibits symptoms of actually being a real, genuine person for once; it helps his character feel more grounded and relatable than simply being a generic self-insert. Kirito's psychological stress and hang-ups in regards to actually killing someone and having this link into the main villain was a smart idea and could have allowed for so much development and understanding of his character and just really how much damage SAO had done to his mental well being. This COULD have been the case if the show expanded on it at all. Kirito's physiological hang-ups barely last for even one episode, which means that his character hardly develops as a person and, instead, is completely absolved of his stress and worries after only a five-minute talk with some nurse at a hospital! They throw out the only interesting thing that has ever happened to this character in only one episode! After this, Kirito just devolves back into the boring, self-insert that he is and his character ceases to ever be interesting ever again. The fact that the show throws out its only redeeming quality is just a flick in the nuts to the audience and, again, is such wasted potential. The show should have started with Kirito waking up in bed or something, after having a dream about the time in which he killed someone in SAO, which would imply that Kirito has been suffering from his PTSD for a while now, as the rest of the show sees him come to terms with what he has done in the past and slowly learn to accept it and move on with his life. It could have made for a fantastic character study, but is just thrown to the side like a child with a toy. 
 
Speaking of wasted potential, this also brings me to the other main character of this arc, Shion. Shion does have a bit more in the way of investment and drive in this narrative but is just as poorly handled like every other element in the show. As a child, Shion was caught up in a post office robbery, in which she manages to get the gun of the robber and shoot him, effectively killing him and saving the lives of everyone in the post office. This, however, has given her a severe phobia of guns, to the point where she throws up at the very sight of them. In order to overcome her phobia, she plays Gun Gale Online, a game all about battling it out with guns in an attempt to overcome her fear of them and she believes that, by winning the Bullet of Bullets tournament (the same one as Kirito enters) , she will be finally strong enough to overcome her fear and move on with her life. Her motivation in this narrative is not so bad but it lacks intrigue. Shion, herself, is a boring character since her characterisation is minimal and I always found it hard to connect to her or care for her struggles or goal. She consistently repeats some of the corniest and irritating lines in the entire show, most prominently during a fight in the second episode where she proclaims that another player is ""strong enough to smile on the battlefield"". The entire show is filled with these corny lines, and I understand that, to this character, the game is a huge deal in overcoming her ordeal but it feels like the show is trying to force drama and narrative stakes with cheesy, hyperbolic lines; it feels superficial and clunky. Shion's character is effectively ruined once she meets big strong Kirito who saves her at every hurdle and sorts out every problem for her. Like every other girl in this series, Shion does begin to feel feelings towards Kirito and she simply becomes just another boring, uninteresting love interest. Her character feels lazily thrown together, with all of the typical Tsundere traits you'd expect. She slaps Kirito after seeing her in minimal clothing (despite it being a video game), she has an apprehensive personality and her character is as inconsistent as a corrupt politician's views. The main problem I have with her character is how quickly the show is willing to let her become the damsel in distress who needs Kirito to save her when it should be the other way around. Shion should have been a side character Kirito meets inside the game, who helps Kirito work out his own mental hang-ups, but instead, she is used for pandering to the Otakus and all the teenagers who see Mr Kirito Mclovin as a self-insert for themselves. 
 
The Villain, Death Gun, is just as bad as these two characters, if not worse in many regards. Myself and many others were able to figure out the identity of who Death Gun really was only after the first episode. Once I saw the opening, I pretty much figured it out since A-1 Pictures doesn't understand subtleties in the slightest. Whilst watching the opening, we see a shot of Shion's friend, Shinkawa, reach out his hand to her while she is on a swing. As he does so, the screen explodes into flames with Death Gun riding on a horse. This visual queue was more than enough for me to understand and suspect that he was Death Gun, which later proved to be correct, but even without this blunder, it is painfully easy to get since Shinkawa seems too nice to be true to Shion and the hints they drop are not exactly subtle. Not only that, but the way the author wrote the way around how Death Gun kills people is needlessly convoluted and stupid. It turns out that Death Gun was working as part of a three-man team, and one person out of this team would go the player's house in the real world, with a lethal injection, ready to inject the person with this stuff, once Death Gun's bullet connects with said person in the game. This would mean that the person at the house would have to be watching a live stream of the tournament, waiting until the bullet connects in order to inject the person. There is so much goddamn wrong with this. For starters, there was no need for such an overly complicated scenario since we already know that this is a fantasy world in which anything is possible. Why couldn't Death Gun kill someone in the game without resorting to this overly complicated and frankly, messy, idea? Not only that, but what happens when the person ready to inject the medicine believes that the bullet connected but it didn't really? What happens if the player is hit but he doesn't see it? This is so stupid it hurts... 
 
Another huge problem is the lack of tension in this arc. Kirito, as usual, is a damn God who can do anything the plot demands from him, just because he is Kirito. One of the things I was most looking forward to in this arc was the fact that Kirito was playing a gun game, a weapon he was not accustomed to and he would have had to learn how to properly yield one and adapt to this world. Much like how the audience wouldn't know anything about this game, Kirito wouldn't either and we could grow attached to this character, seeing him learn the rules and get better the more he played. It would have created, y'know... NARRATIVE TENSION AND STAKES! But, no, Kirito finds a light saber, and thus is now unstoppable since we already know he can use a sword with no trouble whatsoever. Not only that, but despite this game being for hardcore players, Kirito pretty much destroys every single one of them instantly, learns how to use the very hard to control buggies straight away and pretty much deduces the entire plot for the audience through very long and drawn out monologues and exposition scenes. And holy hell is the exposition for this arc terrible! There are so many cafe exposition scenes in this show that it is insane and all of them just essentially tell the audience directly about the plot or how the characters are feeling. Setting exposition scenes in cafes is one of the laziest and boring ways to push a story forward and there are so many scenes like this that I almost fell asleep on many occasions. It's visually boring and only serves to pad out time, and the pacing for this arc is also pretty bad. Stretching out the source material into such a length was a bad idea since it leads to many scenes feeling as if they're dragging on for far too long. Take for example the episodes where Kirito and Shion are taking refuge inside a cave during the Bullet of Bullets tournament. We spend nearly two whole episodes in this god damn cave as we see both characters explain their predicaments and back stories to one another in slow and dull ways. We don't learn anything about the characters nor do we see them grow either, only in that Shion wants Kirito's dick a little more as a result. It's incredibly boring to watch since they just explain their backstories once again to the audience, which, at this point, only serves to pad out the arc and episodes.  
 
The game of Gun Gale Online itself feels so badly done and I imagine that, if this game were real, nobody would be playing this damn game! I have a lot more respect for a show that goes the extra mile to make their world believable but here, the game mechanics that the author thought of to put in the game feel so stupid. For starters, we are told that Gun Gale Online is the only game that has professional, hardcore players which is just a ridiculous notion since I can think of plenty of games off the top of my head that already have pro players, but the customisation option presented in the game is stupid too. We learn that in this game the player has no control over their avatar and it is randomly selected for you! Why on Earth is this a thing? In games, developers are constantly trying to expand on customisation, and the fact that Gun Gale Online locks you into only one playable class only adds to the fact that this game is broken! Moreover, if the avatars are randomly selected for you, then why the hell does Shion look like herself just with blue hair as well as Kirito, only now with longer hair and his character model is that of a female, while other avatars look nothing like their real-life owners? You may call these pedantic things to complain about, and perhaps they are, but when the show is this boring and dull, my mind wonders over to such things since I am not immersed in anything that is happening.  
 
Even the animation wasn't that stellar with frequent use of recap footage and many of the scenes set inside cafes with two characters simply taking. Even the final fight between Kirito and Death Gun is incredibly dull and anti-climatic to boot. This arc is just SO bad on every level from the insanely bad writing, to the stupid as hell plot, to the wasted potential and characters. Everything about the Phantom Bullet arc is awful and I still have even more things to complain and talk about, but I'm getting way ahead of myself. I still have two more arcs to go! 
 
CALIBUR ARC (4/10): 
 
I actually don't have too much to say with this arc since it is rather simple. After Gun Gale Online had finished airing its episodes, many people were tired out from the experience, and for many fans of the series, this was the arc that brought them back to enjoying SAO once again. This arc is a lot more simple in its complexity and is essentially about Kirito and his harem, dicking around in Alfheim Online. Essentially, Kirito and friends hear news of the legendary item, Calibur, has been found and set off on a mission to get this item, along with newcomer to the harem, Shion, who is now put on pause forever and is now part of Kirito's harem bitches. It's an arc that fans of the series will enjoy since it is mostly just comedic hi-jinks and while I did find some of the jokes funny, mostly regarding Klien, I found the arc to be pretty boring since I don't have a modicum of interest for any of these characters at all. It's not a bad arc, but an incredibly boring one for those who, like me, do not like these characters. 
 
MOTHER'S ROSARIO ARC (6/10): 
 
Now, I believe it is time to give some credit where I believe credit is due. This arc is actually not terrible and manages to do quite a lot that actually managed to impress me while handing a character death in a mature and even quite sad way too. This arc focuses more so on Asuna as the main character which I was happy for considering that Asuna is the only character that has anything going for her and luckily her character is not completely ruined and gets some small development. This arc focuses mainly on a girl called Yuki, who is a fantastic player in the game of Alfheim Online, who actually manages to beat Kirito in a fight! Can you believe it?! Anyway, we learn that this character actually has aids and is close to her death, but what is great is that this death and character is actually handled with a lot of care and heart. Yuki's character is simply not there just so that she can be used as a cheap plot device to evoke tears and drama into the story, but actually develops nicely over the course of this story arc into a respectable character, and, while I didn't cry at her death, the show was successful enough to evoke sadness in such a cynical cunt such as myself.  
 
It's easy to feel emphatic towards Yuki's character since she is very lovable and easy to care about. She feels like a real kid going through such a horrible ordeal and her final moments were surprisingly well done. The arc isn't great, however, since the pacing, again, is pretty bad and the newly introduced characters, other than Yuki, don't get much attention and are pushed to the sides, but overall, this arc was a massive improvement. Not only that, but the animation quality and fight choreography are a bit better than that of Gun Gale Online and the arc has a killer opening too. There is much to like about this arc but it ultimately doesn't absolve all of the crap that Gun Gale Online put me through either.  
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
In conclusion, SAO II is a mess. It has frequent tonal shifts, the narrative is terrible with glaring plot holes and other glaring writing issues and even the few things that are worthy of praise, are not enough to raise the bar or change my stance on this show. I know that recently, it has become very trendy and hip to hate on SAO, and while I don't think this show is the worst anime ever made, it certainly is far from good, and every aspect of the show is so lazily produced and boring.

    The story revolves around young children who were wronged and how they come to terms with their grief to ensure their voices are heard. 
 
Zankyou no terror is a show that can burn a hole through your heart. The show portrays a pain that feels so real, even if it's not yours to bear. 
The underlying romance depicted adds wonders to the story. It's restrained but profound. At one point of time, you feel your heart cry out to the possibilities that could have existed. 
 
The music adds on beautifully to the feel of the anime. The Icelandic tunes mixed in with the Japanese tracks and with an English OST appeals not only to the Japanese audience but to a greater population. 
 
The art – one word – spectacular 
 
The characters could have been developed if the show was longer than 11 episodes (which I wish it was). 
 
Definitely a must watch. It’s not a feel good show but gives a reality check.

    So let's start with episode 1, 
in the first scene the male protagonist Yuuto is sleeping and a pink haired girl comes into his room. She says she's a vampire but looks more like a Succubus with the bat wings, the arrow demon tail and the ability to grant wishes. She says that she's gonna suck his soul...so yeah she's a Succubus. 
But the series is actually getting ahead of itself so lets see how it all started: 
so the boy was hired to be the servant at this mansion where lives an oldish man and 3 hot women (a blond, a green haired and a pink haired one) with huge breast and who dont wear bras.  
The boy is replacing his father who the old man claims to be a criminal (maybe that will be explained in ep 2) 
Now lets go back to the boy and the Pink Haired. He's supposed to die by tomorrow since his soul was sucked (actually his dick was sucked, his soul was sucked through his dick, seems like a good way to die) 
Tomorrow comes and he's still alive! Could he be ""The One""?!  
We'll find out next episode. 
 
Ep 2 
So yeah he's the chosen one, not much to tell. He does end up evolving from Yuuto to Super Yuuto though, he ends up looking like Inuyasha and Demon Kurama (from YuYuHakusho).

    Kill La Kill is one of the most ""anime"" anime I've ever seen. The animation and fights are over the top and fun as hell, the plot is fanservice and the show is very much style over substance. 
 
That may seem like a somewhat negative statement but it isn't. 
On the surface, the show could be seen as nothing more than an ecchi magic girl high-school anime, but to some, it can mean so much more and that's what I love so much about Kill La Kill. Sure, to some it can be an utterly ridiculous overhyped mess but for me and I'm sure many others it can be a deeply touching show about maturing and coming to terms with who you are, it could also be about friendship and loving someone no matter what their background may be. It also portrays many more mature themes a lot of anime wouldn't touch very well. 
Maybe it wasn't created with any of the themes I love about it so much in mind but personally, I don't care. 
Also, the second half of this anime is the greatest thing I have ever seen, period. 
 
This show and it's characters mean honestly an endless amount to me, I completely understand why some people hate it and their opinions are just as valid as mine.  
 
Oh and one more thing, the soundtrack is incredible and if you don't like ""Before my body is dry"" (DONT LOSE YOUR WAYYY) then we can't be friends.

    The universe sits atop a house of cards, with revolution shaking at the base. And Kaiba truly does hold an entire universe in its hands.  
This is Sci-Fi through and through, and every bit of it overflows with imagination and experimentation. The strongest aspect of this show is how comfortable the writers felt in their own world. They put passion into this, and tried to make something that would last in the audience's memories. Apart from any pacing or plot problems that may have arisen, this was written in confidence. None of the lesser points are because of weak willed writers unwilling to be adventurous. If you want to see something different and intriguing, I give a hearty recommendation on that basis alone. If you also happen to be a fan of Sci-Fi, well then, sharpen your knives and prepare for a feast. (Viewers with little patience should probably sit this one out though.)  
 
Right off the bat, Kaiba starts with a character that has amnesia, and that sends up a bunch of warning signals. Many stories with poor writing will proudly display an amnesiac protagonist because it frees up the job of writing complex personality, pre-existing character interactions, and is just a giant gateway to spoon-feed plot and exposition to the audience. But do not fear, for Kaiba never once considers being a shoddy, overused amnesia story. In fact, the amnesia is more of just a presence that is ever-looming, not overbearing. They don't waste energy trying to cover holes with it, but instead rip apart the foundations of this trope and rebuild it anew, devoting the entire premise of this show to memories. Even if the execution wasn't masterful, they plunged head first into trying something different, and of course, that is where this show excels. 
 
With the whole element of memory storage and body swapping, our main character Warp actually spends a great deal of time in a cheaply made, mute body, incapable of speaking. This does suppress how much of his personality can be expressed, and in the beginning, his position in the show isn't clear. The same can be said for many of his companions. But in the same manner that silent or minimalistic films make more from less, we are given brief moments to step into the mind of Warp. Each little morsel of his character development made more savory by their rarity and good delivery. 
 
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the entire cast. Kaiba is more about the story, and does sacrifice the quality of its supporting characters for the sake of plot points. Being partially episodic, Kaiba sometimes tries to cram entire character arcs into one or two sittings. Leaving the writers to fall back on melodrama to try and relay an expansive history or grand emotions in a compressed time. It can distance the viewer from the characters and belay the intentions of the production team. In other cases, certain episodes will excel within their limited time, and give us touching, memorable characters and anecdotes. This is a fluctuation in quality that wanes over time, leaving most of the second half solidly written. 
 
Much like GitS: SAC, it's less of a classical narrative, and more of a series of experiences woven together. The precision is still there, and the plot takes you somewhere, just not in the typical manner. Power, lust, greed, lies, righteousness, pain, and bonds of friendship all weave an ever tightening noose that threatens to choke the ruling class. In the world of Kaiba, human equality isn’t even an afterthought, and our crew is ready to take back their dignity, and a little more for good measure. Caught in a power struggle with ever shifting tides, the weak are forever pushed further into the abyss as the strong climb upwards. Puppets and scapegoats, forced into destructive bodies and unable to feel or draw happiness, they are scattered about as simple war machines. Despite all of their artificial power, they remain true helpless souls. With minds used, battered and abused, they dwell in the deepest pit carved by humanity, and sit there alone, betrayed by others' ambitions and their own tainted memories. Kaiba performs a tragic duel between our own identity, and the persona that others sculpt for us. 
 
Kaiba takes up residence in the ""here's what we can do with anime as a medium"" category. It's artwork contests traditional design and usually comes up on top. On the technical side of things, it goes for fluidity rather than individual details, meaning this show rarely sits still. The frames keep turning, and action, reaction, and intricacy are all captured in the animation. They can afford to do this because of the simplistic character structures and complete lack of shading. Now this is a stylistic choice, and I think it goes well with the overall atmosphere of the show. At times it's truly jaw dropping, and you get the impression that any other style of art simply wouldn't have worked for this series. On the flip side, there are a few moments where nothing is happening, the movement stops, and the magic sort of drains away for a second. However, there is something in the art department that is uncontestedly good. The CG integration is hardly noticeable at all, even when the fast, sweeping shots cover a lot of background, it looks very smooth and naturally painted. 
 
Sticking with story over characters, the score doesn't really have any character themes that show up like in other anime. There are mostly just soundtracks to enhance the action or accompany the mood of a scene. These only show up occasionally, and for the rest of the show, and bulk of it, we're given diegetic sounds and environmental noises that usually complement the atmosphere. In this aspect, it's not the best sound editing I've heard, but most of the time there are clean transitions, good sound effects, and nothing too obtrusively out of place. The music itself is poignant. The melodies of Kiyoshi Yoshida range from whimsical to pondering melancholy, and will stay with you long after the episode has run its course. Just like with Warp's character moments, the music is withheld until it's appropriate, and when it'll be cherished most by the audience. Now, while the compositions are very good, the implementation is a bit clumsy sometimes, and it can get noticeable when songs are reused too often. 
 
Given how Kaiba tries to avoid dry heaps of exposition, the dialogue is an ever occurring source of world-building. Just like the viewer, Warp is trying to absorb everything from other people and his surroundings. This calls for more intricate writing, and is very effective in synchronizing the audience with the emotions and experiences of Warp, when it works. Sadly, the first couple of episodes were still exploring this, trying to find a solid tempo and direction, and so some of the scenes can feel scripted and unnatural. This is particularly noticeable with some moments of oddly placed comedy. But again, this all gets ironed out as the episode count grows, and it becomes a much smoother ride.  
 
The voice acting is above the standard fare, but won't have you clamoring to see the actors in other roles. Everyone does their job, and they do it well, particularly one actor who does deserve special mention. Hisao Egawa knocks it straight out of the park from the very moment he appears on screen. Providing the voice of Vanilla, he steps directly into the character, encapsulating the absurd, blundering, and over-the-top personality of our not so noble sheriff. 
 
In the end we walk away with a very well controlled space oddity that radiates familiarity from the writers, as if they've spent part of their lives in this future universe. A superb drama? Not quite. But an intricate story that explores outside the realm of typical series. With that in mind, this is not a show meant to be watched casually. An attentive viewer is required to get the most out of what it has to offer. If you're looking for something to put on in the background, hold off on this show until you have time to truly watch it. Otherwise, get ready for a fantastic Sci-Fi experience. 
 
My final verdict for this show is a respectable 8.4

    Code Geass is one of those animes that you look back on and remember the emotional roller coaster that will forever change your view on mecha animes. Code Geass is quite possibly the most entertaining and amazing anime to date and here is the review.  
 
Story - 
 
When I started watching the first episode of Code Geass when it aired I immediately thought it was going to be another generic mecha but when I continued the episode and finished the series i ate those words. The pace of the story is quick in the beginning that really draws you in. Not in a way that gets you confused but a smooth and nice flow that works great with the story. You will never feel board or feel that the story is moving to slow. For Code Geass picks up the action at the right time and develops characters well. Code Geass's action is great and the visuals are well done for its time but, whats more important is the action scenes have purpose. There is reason for fight scenes, never mindless action to appeal to the audience which makes Code Geass's story shine above all other mechas. Scenes matter and they are well thought out and the action too is always justified, for there is always some larger plan or scheme going on.  
 
- Characters 
 
Another way Code Geass shines above other mechas and other animes is the way the main character handles himself. The main protagonist is Lelouch Lambouge. He isn't the strongest character or even the best pilot for the mechs (which are called Knightmare Frames) but what he lacks in strength he more than makes up for in leadership and cunning abilities. You never feel that Lelouch is a static character but, you see him grow and change through out the series. Each time a tragic event happens it has an effect on him not for just an episode but, carries on and you really see how things that effect him change him as an individual. This gives you a feeling that he can change his way of thinking to any direction and gives the viewer a suspenseful feel about him.This doesn't only happen with the main character but several characters in fact. Code Geass has many out standing characters who do well with an already strong presence like Lelouch. You never feel like the side characters don't contribute to anything or they are there to fill the screen but, each side character have interesting plots that are fleshed out. 
 
- Negative  
 
Code Geass does at times feels like it has an identity crisis. The reason for this is the show gives humor (which there is nothing wrong with this) where the characters feel clowny and not realistic in a serious toned anime. Comedy is needed in a show to break the all serious tone of the show but, some viewers may feel that it goes over the top and at points ridiculous. At one point of the show a character is introduced (Mao) that you feel is over the top and his point is just to give the viewer some information that could have been told. This character in the show I feel really they could have done without and the show would have benefited greatly. Code Geass Also may feel sometimes like things work out to well. Some may feel that Lelouch is too smart for his own good and seems to be a genius just because the writers say he is without giving any indication on how he became a genius.  
 
- Conclusion  
 
In conclusion Code Geass is a great anime that I feel everyone needs to watch. This anime has everything, Mechs, great battle scenes, love interests, plot twists, intelligent story, interesting characters who are well fleshed out, and amazing art and sound. Code Geass amazes me every time I re watch it and those who are on the fence I would say take the leap you wont regret it.

    Spice & Wolf II is uniqe series for many reasons. It is such good or even better than 1st series (which already was great).  It is one of the most magical and sentimental story I ever watched and on top of it there were many words play which I love. 
 
Story is outstanding. It is about Lawrance (traveling merchant) and Horo (the wise wolf) who are traveling all over the world together and heading towards Holo's home town while making trades along the way. The story is building atmosphere from the 1st to the last second of each episode. The plot is great and everybody will enjoy it. What catch an eye is great balance between romance, jokes and money-making stuff :) 
 
Art is great, surroundings and backgrounds are well detailed, the colors are showing atmosphere, feelings sharp and clearly. The line is good too with old fashioned anime noses and eyes ^^  Animation is good and smooth. Characters are beautifull detailed in every aspect. 
 
Sound is well matched to the middle age action. It is good prepared for the background and in many important scenes is well matched and don't disappoint. It gives me chills then =]  Voice actors suites well and are full of emotions when it is needed (bravo for them).  
 
Enjoyment is obviously great and I think this anime is one of the best in this year so far. 
 
Overall: I can say just this 99% of you will be attached to this story because it is one of the uniqe and unforgetable anime.  For anime 9/10  for me and my english 3/5. Thanks for reading, now go and watch ^^

    I was a huuuuge fan of Inuyasha back then when it was shown on TV. At the end i was soo sad to see that open ending. So you can imagine how happy i was when i saw that they made a final season :) 
I try to keep it short so you don't get bored reading this review. 
 
Story: 
The story begins where the last season ended. Inuyasha, Kagome, Mirokou, Sango and Shippo are on there journey with their final goal - defeat Naraku.So you can guess the main focus of this season is the fighting between Inuyasha and Naraku. Of course there are also some sidestorys which are at least as interesting as the main story. 
 
Art: 
It's at least as good as in the previous season.I found myself sometimes looking at the background and not only at the characters because it looked very nice. Also Inuyashas sword Tesaiga(did i wrote it right?) lookes just awesome. Especially when he gains new Abilitys with it. 
 
Sound: 
The opening ""kimi ga inai mirai"" from Do as inifinty is nice and the endings where also just awesome. 
 
Characters: 
Of course there are the precious ones like Sango, Naraku and who would have though, Inuyasha and Kagome. But there are also some knew and important character(If you want to know watch it). 
 
All in all Inuyasha - kanketsu-hen is just the perfect ending of an amazing series. I have nothing to complain about this anime.I hope this helped you to get some information about Kanketsu hen:)

    This is my first review, even though it's for a show I dropped, I just couldn't resist ranting a little due to its popularity. I tried to get into this anime multiple times, but I still don't get its phenomenon. Maybe I'm just few years too late and I can't appreciate it as much as when it was airing. On top of that there's a lot of good comedies in recent seasons. 
 
Story: 
Seems like there's no real plot, it's just a slice of life gag comedy with a bunch of little girls. And since comedy is the biggest part of this show let's talk about that - it's not for me. I think it's too random, the jokes drag on for too long and sometimes it feels like there was no actual punchline. Part of the jokes just fly over my head, simply because I'm not japanese and part of them aren't that funny to begin with. If it manages to make me laugh/smile only few times per episode I don't think it's doing a good job as a gag comedy. 
 
Art: 
The animation itself is very good, however I really dislike this artstyle, the character design is so simplistic that I wouldn't even count it as moe. It actually starts to remind me those chibi spin-off shows rather than a proper anime. Kyoto Animation is known for making cute and gorgeous-looking shows, but this one is neither of those things to me. 
 
Sound: 
It's ok. Nothing in the soundtrack really stood out to me. The voice actors are doing a good job, but nothing really worth noting. 
 
Characters: 
They're so forgettable that I can barely remember their names and personality traits. I feel like if some of the characters got replaced by other people, some viewers wouldn't even notice the difference.  
 
Overall: 
This show has nothing to offer besides comedy which is subjective. But even if you'd enjoy this type of humor it's still lacking the story and characters while having passable art and sound. You probably won't miss anything if you just watch some ""Nichijou funny moments compilation"" on Youtube instead of watching the whole anime. I sometimes wonder if the people who give it a 10/10 score do it as a joke in similar way to Pingu in the City.

    ""If you want to destroy my scarves~ Pull this thread as I walk away..."" - Weezer 
 
This movie was absolutely dreadful, as expected of a Naruto filler. I'd give it two thumbs down, 0/5 Stars, but 1 is the lowest score I'm allowed to give on myanimelist. Essentially Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 7 - The Last is nothing more than a marketing ploy to milk this franchise for what its worth by impliedly promising this is the last time we will ever see Naruto and friends. Here's what you need to know.  
 
1. It's super cheesy (""I will punch you until you learn the meaning of friendship! Dattebayo!!!"" - Naruto) 
2. There's plot holes galore (None of the Antagonist's reasonings for his actions make any sense. Why does he live on the moon with a bunch of little slave children? Seriously, does no one care about the little slave children?) 
3. There's very little fighting (unless you consider raves and light shows fighting) 
4. There's no plot progression (nothing gets resolved, and we don't learn anything new) 
 
(Spoiler Alert: Because no one should be watching this for the plot) 
 
Really, the best things about this movie was the peanut gallery humor and finding out Naruto loves Hinata. Oops, did I spoil that for anyone? Yeah, didn't think so. Speaking of humor, the ""I'm going to take your eyes"" gag of Naruto canon has got to be the most hilariously pretentious meme I could ever imagine. Kishi must have been on crack when he came up with that one. And for those holding out a shred of hope Naruto and Sasuke would team up one more time Avengers-style (which would have been awesome considering how the manga ended and the fact that they are literally the two most powerful beings in the universe), they don't even meet in the movie. Sasuke gets less than 10 seconds of screen time, only to blow up the plot even more by saying ""Hey, I pretty much could have done this movie by myself if only I weren't too busy avoiding my clingy girlfriend's vajayjay because I'm totally into dudes."" The graphics quality is obviously high but the animation and choreography is pathetic. The music is Naruto 101.  
 
""Last The: Movie Naruto The"" (or whatever the fuq its called) can be sum up as such - Girl meets boy. Girl likes boy. Boy and Girl are destined to be together. Aw... Creepy Guy wants to destroy the world, but he has another equally important agenda - marry Girl. Why? Because saving the world is not enough motivation for Boy. Creepy Guy coerces Girl to his castle, then gives her the freedom to walk around and destroy his plans. Boy is worried Girl left him for Creepy Guy because everyone knows men who want to kill everyone are SoOoOo Dreamy~ *cough* Sasuke *cough*. Creepy Guy says ""You cannot punch me! Hahaha!"" Boy punches Creepy Guy. World is saved, because why not? Seriously guys, most fan fiction is better than this.

    While the original Yes Precure 5 had some very good points to it, it's undeniable that there were some consistent flaws in the series that bogged down its enjoyment. While GoGo is far from flawless, it definitely succeeds in being a very solid sequel that helps to pick up where the original Yes 5 had fallen. 
 
The plot doesn't stray too far from the typical thing that you'd expect from a Precure season - an evil organization is seeking out items that, if in their hands, could destroy the world. The five girls, who had given up their powers at the end of the first Yes 5, are resurrected as Precure when a guardian named Flora calls for their help. The plot proceeds pretty typically, though it does have some strong points to it. For one thing, there's a sideplot that revolves around one of the characters' past and inner conflict with the evil organization that flows very well. The plot also ties up many important things that are brought up. In general, the plot of GoGo can shine when it truly wants to. There are some aspects in it that could be better fleshed out, and there's also the fact that the plot takes a while to properly progress. There's also the fact that later on in the show, GoGo ends up completely dropping and forgetting about two of its villains and never gives us a resolution in terms of their whereabouts. Regardless, the story of GoGo manages to be one that keeps itself steady throughout most of the run. 
 
However, most people don't watch Precure for the plot, but for its endearing characters. GoGo has the advantage of having viewers that already know and are attached to the main cast, so it's not hard to become reattached to them in the sequel. Seeing as there are five (later six) girls on the team, the show makes it a point to give everyone equal screentime. Although our leader is quite obvious, the spotlight doesn't hesitate to shine on the other girls when need be. GoGo also makes it a point to focus a bit more on the girls' goals and the struggles they face when attempting to achieve them. One of our main characters has an implied learning disability, yet seeks to be a teacher, and shows some very real struggle and inner conflict in trying to attain her dream. While most of the development took place in season one, GoGo still gives us room to give everyone a bit more depth to their character when it comes to things like their goals and dreams. 
 
Anyone who watched the first season would know that there was quite a lot of, to be blunt, cilche and cheesy romance, namely between Nozomi and Coco. If you weren't a big fan of this, then you'll be very pleased to know that GoGo features little to none of the dramatic, shoujo-y romance subplots that Yes5 had. This season has a bigger focus on both our main female cast and our two new main characters, Kurumi and Syrup, and cuts out the unnecessary and kind of embarassing romance the first season had. Speaking of Kurumi and Syrup, the development for these two characters is also a big plus in GoGo. Syrup in particular undergoes a lot of inner and outer conflict and develops into a very solid ally of the Precure. While Kurumi's development doesn't reach near those levels, her relationship with the girls throughout the show  helps her become a more fully-fleshed out character. 
 
GoGo also improves with its villains in a way that would help shape Precure villains in the future. Pretty much every season pre-GoGo would follow a route of having one villain attack the girls for a few weeks, get killed off, and replaced. The reason this wouldn't work well is because it wouldn't give the viewer time to get to know the villain or their past and motivations. GoGo, while it still does do some quick villain killing, keeps its villains alive much longer than usual and also lets one become redeemed. This lets you become much more invested in what they're doing, rather than wondering when they're going to be replaced.  
 
The art for GoGo has a much sharper and cleaner look to it, and it's definitely worth nothing that there's been an animation upgrade. Regardless of that, the season is still riddled with many instances of off-model scenes from Toei, which is to be expected in any long-running Toei show. When it tries, however, the animation can end up being extremely fluid resulting in very well-animated fights. The transformations also received an upgrade, which finally involved dynamic movements whilst transforming.  
 
The soundtrack is not much different at all from the original Yes5, and still consists of composter Naoki Sato. There are many familiar tracks included in GoGo that you may notice when watching the show. Sato's music is very well-done and helps to exemplify both the slice of life and the dramatic moments of the show. His music generally compliments the show in a very positive way.  
 
GoGo, in many ways, ranks above Yes5 when it comes to enjoyment. GoGo manages to have quite a few memorable episodes and the more consistent villains helps add on to this as well. Again, being familiar with a majority of the cast also helps to raise the enoyment of the series, giving it an advantage in that sense. It definitely does a great job at keeping the viewers entertained, and when it really tries, ends up doing an excellent job at just that. 
 
While GoGo is far from a perfect sequel or season in general, it's able to have a solid enough cast and story to be one that is worth watching for anyone that got enjoyment out of the original Yes5. It's improvements in romance, villains, and even animation help bring it up a few notches over the original season as well. If you were a bit disappointed in how the original handled these things, then I'd recommend that you give GoGo a gogo and see how it fares up to the original. While it's a generally forgotten season, it's one that fans of Yes5 should definitely pick up.

    I would definitely recommend watching this anime, though note, that if you are a beginner in the drama genre, it will be a pretty heavy title to start with. But heavy does not necessarily mean bad, it just means that the emotions that you get from the story will need to be cycled through, since when you watch through about half of the episodes, you will start questioning a lot of things and just overall will start thinking about life and how such situations might exist. Which goes to my suggestion that you should have a day off at that point and continuating from there later. (Trust me that's the best way.) 
 
As for story, it is really well written and in the end you shouldn't feel like there is something missing, since everything has a reason for being there, and if you have watched it till the end, you will understand what I mean. (The ending just makes sense.) Every character in the story has a purpose, which is really great, since it doesn't feel like the tipical cliche type of story and also the characters give it more depth along with it. The characters are almost perfect, there aren't exactly many flaws or even big flaws, since it is mostly about their thinking and perception in the story, about making sometimes questionable decisions. Artstyle is really good, didn't really see any flaw there either and it's great that they chose to go for that, since it makes it more mellow and easier to interpret. 
 
So for overall I would give the anime a solid 9.5/10, because nothing is perfect, but this is definitely really close to it. This is definitely what I would call a masterpiece. 
And like I said in the beginning, this is a heavy title, but if you want to give it a shot (which you should), do it like I said and you should be fine. I hope you like it as much as I did!

Seen via japanese audio with english subtitles. 
 
Generally found this animation to be fine but in terms of the ecchi perspective you are getting a fair amount of material on a couple of girls.  
 
The story remained true. Although going from what proceeded the intro to what this episode came to be about was slightly confusing. Then you throw in that tiny speed bump for a conclusion. When you really think about it it makes sense but could have used more or an aid for explanation. Like recall that time or the use of dreaming sequence transitions.

    Pros: 
+  Art, animation and music are outstanding 
+  Some episodes are genuinely touching and can make you cry 
 
Cons: 
- Full of plotholes that could have been easily fixed 
( how do they have advanced bionic limbs in 1918 equivalent, how was Violet a super soldier at the age of 10 without any superhuman modifications to her body, why people who can clearly read and write use the service of ghost-writers and many more ) 
- The general plot is very simple and feels like an excuse to make Violet act in a certain way 
- Violet sometimes presents so little reflection about the world around her that it just makes you cringe 
 
Summary: 
Does this anime deserve to be so highly rated? 
From the plot standpoint - certainly not. 
From the artwork standpoint - yes. 
Should you give it a try? 
Of course - even if you have much higher demands when it comes to the storyline you will certainly appreciate the form it is presented in.

    Gintama is the perfect anime comedy. Everything about it is perfect, you can watch any episode at random and it will be the absolute best choice you make this day! Go watch it! Stop reading! 
(long pause) 
+THAT'S IT?? THIS DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY FOR A REVIEW! THIS IS NOT EVEN YOUTUBE COMMENT TIER!! 
You don't understand, dear Shinpachi. If I told something else my text would reveal too much about myself and people wouldn't like to watch the show. 
+Now you are making dumb excuses, aren't you? 
So this is the end of the review. And remember, watch Gintama! This is everything that matters. 
+NO!! WE ARE DONE? WHAT ABOUT THE REASONING? AND WHY DO YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ARE BEING PAID BY SUNRISE? 
Fine, fine. Then we'll make something else. I have a revolutionary idea. An interactive review! 
+How does that work? 
Easy! We only need to pick random phrases from previous reviewers and form a cohesive text. Like this! 
 
The characters convey a sense of visual individuality that at times goes beyond that of other shounen anime, although this is tempered with a small degree of genericism that allows the humour to flourish. They're imaginative, memorable and varied creations, each unique and appealing in their own different way. The main characters present incredible amounts of enthusiasm and are the real driving force behind Gintama, but certain members of the unbelievably vast supporting cast are almost as integral in their own right. Most of them are used for one or two jokes and that’s pretty much it. 
+HEY!! STOP IT! MAL IS GOING TO SUE US! AND YOUR PARAGRAPH DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE! 
Fine, we'll try with another type of review. Ah, MAL loves nostalgia! Let's go with this! 
 
I remember when I was just a little kid, playing with my toys, going to school and having fun all the time. Every evening I was the first to leave the classroom and go home, so I wouldn't miss a single episode from Gintama... 
+What are you talking about? You were an edgy teen when Gintama first aired! These memories are fake! 
But does it really matter if these memories are real or fake? The important thing is that they permeate with the viewers and help us manipulate them and take control of their poor souls. 
+Psst, Jal, they can read us. And what is this evil scheme for a review anyway? 
Okay, okay, I get it. Maybe it's time to bring the technical review. 
 
The Amanto, aliens from outer space, have invaded Earth and taken over feudal Japan. As a result, a prohibition on swords has been established, and the samurai of Japan are treated with disregard as a consequence. 
 
However one man, Gintoki Sakata, still possesses the heart of the samurai, although from his love of sweets and work as a yorozuya, one might not expect it. Accompanying him in his jack-of-all-trades line of work are Shinpachi Shimura, a boy with glasses and a strong heart, Kagura with her umbrella and seemingly bottomless stomach, as well as Sadaharu, their oversized pet dog. Of course, these odd jobs are not always simple, as they frequently have run-ins with the police, ragtag rebels, and assassins, oftentimes leading to humorous but unfortunate consequences. 
 
Who said life as an errand boy was easy? 
+THIS IS NOT A REVIEW! YOU JUST COPIED THE SYNOPSIS AND PASTED IT! 
The perfect objective review. 
+TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! 
Oh my God, you are so difficult to please, Shinpachi. This is MAL! We should be able to get away with anything! 
+DON'T SAY THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF A REVIEW! 
What is your pick then? I'm so tired... Maybe we should stop being pressured to please everybody. You know, this text is meant to be personal. 
+BUT NOBODY IS LIKING IT! 
Jeez, this is exhausting. I'm taking a nap. You take care of the rest. 
+HEY! WAKE UP, YOU ASSHOLE! 
Alright, you know? Do it yourself. Bring your awesome idea and I'll join. 
+Maybe we should start our review with a memorable quote from the series. Something that feels both epic and representative and convinces our readers to watch this show. 
Fine, I'll go with your second-rate idea. Like this? 
 
""My anus is bleeding!"" - Kagura, episode 270 
+NO! WHAT KIND OF QUOTE IS THIS? IT'S NOT EVEN IN THE SHOW! And what is supposed to be epic about this? 
Well, it is quite accurate for the mood of the show... 
+You have a point there, but what is so epic about this? It sounds like the catchphrase of some obscure rejected cartoon! 
Agh, I get it, I get it! Let's do it your way! 
 
""""Listen… I don't care what you do somewhere else in the universe, but anywhere within reach of my sword, is my country!"" - Gintoki Sakata, episode 13 
+Finally! This sounds perfect! 
Gintama is anime comedy in its ultimate form. A long-running collection of anecdotes, quirks and a playful narrative that mixes some serious with tons of crazy fun, the series has caught the attention of the viewers due to its creative and irreverent style of comedy and its flawless delivery. Over the years it has gained a well-deserved cult status and a growing dedicated fanbase that receives every following season with renewed enthusiasm. And the staff has answered properly by keeping a standard of quality that is unmatched in such a long run, with clear and crisp visuals and an animation that captures both the choreographied movements of its fascinating fight sequences and the awkward quirks and gestures of its routine comedy, and a soundtrack that after so many years keeps adding pieces that resonate and become the perfect accompaniment for any mood the show intends to create. 
 
But we all know that the aesthetic presentation is not the only thing that matters, and in the case of Gintama, it may be subsidiary. So, what is the secret of its success? Is it worth investing this huge amount of time? 
 
The Gintama Review Show will be back after these messages. 
+OOOOOOOII!! WHY ARE YOU INSERTING A CLIFFHANGER AND A COMMERCIAL BREAK IN A REVIEW? 
Our readers need time to assimilate the information we provide. 
+You haven't said that much. Do you really trust our readers? Besides, they can just scroll down and ignore this filler nonsense. 
We are back to The Gintama Review Show. In the previous episode... 
+WHY ARE WE DOING RECAPS NOW? THIS ISN'T EVEN A SERIALIZED PROGRAM! JUST GO ON WITH THE REVIEW! 
Jeez, you must be so fun at parties, Shinpachi. Okay, let's continue where we left it. 
 
The answers to these questions lie obviously on the writing department. After all these years the jokes of Gintama haven't grown stale despite being based on predictable quirks and outcomes. How is that? Simply, because the characters form one of the most well-rounded casts an anime series has ever displayed. Each with their own individual personality traits, that complement each other and offer hundreds of possibilities for interaction. The fact that Gintama is such a vast and open world helps as well by keeping the series fresh. Almost anything is possible in the realm of this show, from dirty to complex fourth wall jokes, from hilarious slice-of-life to far-fetched premises. And this huge variety of scenarios forms a cohesive whole thanks to a large bunch of characters that remain solid and recognizable through any of them. The voice acting for each of them is spot on and makes sure that the quality of the delivery is at its highest every time, and in the end, even in the least amusing bits, you can't help but enjoy the little interactions between characters and quirks you have grown so fond of. 
 
In spite of the above stated, Gintama is a series that is doomed to be divisive. Comedy as a genre almost guarantees irregular reception from the viewers and this is no exception. On the other hand, such a long run is an investment and people may feel pressured by the insane amount of episodes they have to go through. It is commonly agreed as well that it starts very slow, and the huge variety of ""Gintama gets good after the first X episodes"" newcomers get from fans can be exhausting. On that matter, I suggest to just try and establish your own pace. One of the advantages of this series is that you can leave it and go back to it any time you want. It is structured in either episodic stories or short standalone arcs, making it an ideal anime to watch under this routine. And if you eventually get tired, feel free to leave! Nothing is less recommendable than struggling through a show that is supposed to be laid-back fun 80% of the time. 
 
In the end, this is a show I am very fond of and I will very happy to see people trying, no matter if they end up liking it or not. I don't know you, and you don't know me, but if you ask me ""Is Gintama worth it?"" I will always be glad to answer something like [url=https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1353749#msg38178609]this[/url]. 
+Pssst, Jal! BBCode is disabled for reviews! 
And why didn't you tell anything? Now my conclusion sounds stupid as hell! Nobody is going to like this! Nobody will find it helpful! 
+We can fix it! Just focus a little more on it! You were doing well before! 
Shinpachi... 
+What? 
Time's up.

Kimetsu no Yaiba.. 
 
It's an enjoyable watch and a lot better than other shounen anime's I've watched in the past (i actually made it to epsiode 200 odd of bleach but had to give up because each fight took 2 episodes and the characters got very repetitive although i did like the cat woman) 
 
The animation is great that gets solid 9 from the first episode to the last it's been consistently good. 
 
Story line, the main character is a shining light in front the dark world he's been thrown into, he has no choice but to survive and we embark on his journey to save his sister which is  a pretty tall order. Thankfully we don't have a character that constantly knocks himself and has self doubt every episode, he is motivated and will get his man in the end albeit with some sacrifices on the way no doubt.The story moves along pretty swiftly and most of the characters including the enemies have their own history which is covered nicely and not prolonged. Some filler bits and also his sidekicks that join later in the series which i would've preferred them not to have existed but they will have a part to play. There's some touching moments, you really feel the connection between himself and Nezuko and also from the other demon slayers that believe in him. Script wise it's pretty action type stuff unless it's a memory of the past etc then it goes a little deeper, for an easy watch with no real thinking involved it does it's job. 
 
Sound, I can still hear the opening theme song so it's decent. 
 
So i think 8.5% is a good score for the show, if you haven't seen it then it's for sure one to binge on.

    Coppelion is an anime about these radiation immune Charlie's Angels who cry all the time and whatnot.  
 
It's a melodramatic sci-fi story about these girls who won't die on radiation unlike all the other people in the world. These people are of course saints, and we get to see missions where our three radiation immune saints save people from radiation while crying. By three radiation immune saints saving people, I mean our main girl, Ibarawhatever, saving people while the other two watch. Alternatively watch and cry.  
 
The character are pretty useless and stupid and for some reason there is three of them instead of one. There was a seemingly interesting settings; normal people getting saved by radiation immune people. The catch being that normal people don't think these immune people as people at all. People see them as dolls, basically. However, their actions on saving normal people would change normal people's views about radiation immune people == change for character development. Unfortunately situations like these get turned back to zero by our main girl who simply replies "" I don't understand such complicated things."" Then we move to an another scene about crying. Followed by the next mission. Leaving me wonder why the fuck. It's not deep, there is no message. She just literally says that I'm too fucking stupid to follow what you are saying about me being like human and I also have to cry since I haven't for a while.  
 
This really could have been an interesting series if there was other things going on, the characters had some sort of brain function and there was a reason for all of this. A plot, some motives, a tiny bit of depth of some sort, but instead of this the creators decided to take a way which should be referred as ""I have a emotion thingy."" This is seriously more like some project which is still on the beta stage, only way to make it sell is to add 5 radiation immune and 5 normal bishies to the series and call it a reverse harem.

    Story: 7/10 Really average, full of cliches which have been seen hundreds of times in other anime. While this anime might appeal to newcomers to the genre for most people into the slice of life / school anime you will feel like they have already seen everything this anime has to offer previously. On a positive note the story has very good pacing and does a good job to keep your attention.  
 
Art: 8/10 The art was pretty good as a whole although it did have some awkward moments. The backgrounds are really detailed and the animation was fluid. Very pleasant to watch, overall no complaints there.  
 
Sound: 5/10 Piano, piano and more piano. Again, nothing revolutionary here. It does the job relatively well however do not expect to fall in love with the OST. 
 
Character: 6/10 While the characters look very generic they make up for it in their development throughout the series. The characters have somewhat realistic personalities which many viewers can relate to however they develop in a very predictable way. For reference I don't even remember the main characters name after finishing the series about two hours ago - not due to the anime's short length but due to the generic design.  
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 Although the anime is nothing special, it is not by any means bad. I enjoyed my time watching it even though there were some negatives. If you enjoy other slice of life anime you will like this one too, no doubt - however do not expect anything revolutionary.  
 
Overall I gave the anime what some people might consider a ""low"" score not because the anime is bad. But it has simply all been done before, would I recommend this anime to a friend? No. Would I put it in my top 10 list? No. However what is here is still a decent anime to get us through the season.

    You know, after watching the series of the same name, I would never think it would continue or developed to be such a big franchise. However, the ending of the series didn’t quite satisfy some folks or that it went some confused and/or dazed (I was just confused some of the time in this show) but luckily after 3-4 years when the series ran in 2006, there was a movie adaptation coming to the fray in 2010 in Japan, but I didn’t know if it was one of those compilation movies where they just put scenes from the show and make it different somehow. 
  
  
  
Shirou Emiya finds himself an unwilling participant in a deadly competition where seven Mages summon heroic spirits as servants to duel each other to the death. They compete for the chance to make a wish from the Holy Grail, which has the power to grant any wish. Shiro is unskilled as a mage and knows nothing of the Holy Grail War, but he and his servant, Saber, enters into a temporary partnership with another Mage, Rin Tohsaka. However, problems arise between Shirou and Rin's servant, Archer, who seems to seriously despise him. 
  
  
  
You know what, I could go over how I feel about the characters and story of this show but I would be repeating myself from the series’ review. However, I will say that the story has a very darker tone, compared to the PG-13ish tamer nature of the series, cutting out some of the high school filler and anything with the two non-major characters and while it does a retelling of it, some characters who you expect to make it out alive in the series, without giving spoilers away, some of them got some fucked-up deaths and for some of the latter part of the movie, it’s centered around Shiro and Archer, as opposed to Saber, who still have a major role in this but more in the background. Also, you know Shiro still has ideals of him becoming a champion of justice, being a hero and all that while Archer, who’s been through it all, became cynical about it and feels the need to kill Shiro to remind him of that. 
  
  
  
Honestly, I’m with Archer on this, mainly because I still stand by the fact that Shiro is that noble jackass who has these traditional hero traits but when it comes to him going against opponents that are more stronger and powerful than him, he is still the hard-headed moron that doesn’t get it that he can easily die of that. Sure, you can say he may not be strong, but he has heart but you forget that you also need brains to fighting an opponent or uses their advantages against them, which Shiro did sort of used in the end. 
  
  
  
For the animation by Studio DEEN………this actually does resemble the animation in Fate/Zero but this is on a movie budget so of course, it’s going to look better than the series since that was made in 2006-07 and the movie in 2010 with the fighting animation more fluid, the brutal scenes feel more gripping as you watch it and maybe felt some scenes that involves a lot of blades, hence, Blade Works. The music has the mysterious and haunting tone that it was going for but I barely notice some of it as I watched it. 
  
  
  
The Sentai Filmworks dub with used the original (sort of) voice actors from the series, provided by Bang Zoom Entertainment and if you remember, I said, they used THREE DIFFERENT VOICE ACTRESSES for Saber and this is the second one voiced by Michelle Ruff and for her performance…..it was nothing outstanding. She did fine or close to Kate Higgins to an extent as Ruff always works her monotone voice in most anime characters and it was just a “meh” performance. The dub as a whole was more of a step up from the TV series, it was a 60% improvement over the TV series. 
  
  
  
FINAL VERDICT: The movie passes on levels that it took a darker tone in the franchise, making it more serious than what it was but alas, it still suffers from the same problems with the same characters. If I could say this, I would just watch the movie and just skip the show now that I have seen it and like many others say, some of the answers will be further explained in Fate/Zero.

         I have to say if one new anime gives me hope that anime is still epic that is Fate zero. Probably the best anime since FMA brotherhood a masterpiece and a beautiful one at that. The best part of the anime is its art and animation its mind blowing i can find only few other anime that can come close. The story picked up during season 2 with a faster pace and my favorite part the story about kirisurugus childhood in episodes 18-19. Almost as good as the animation is the music its epic thats all i can say. And every of the characters are interesting and fun to watch my favorite is emiya kiritsugu his like spike spigel version 2. 
all in all a fantastic anime recommended to any anime fan the only thing that i can take from the anime is its ending i liked it but it was kinda  anticlimactic but thats only one episode. OVERALL 10/10

    Having just finished half a dozen or so light-themed shows, Alderamin was a great palette cleanser. This show is a military-based, strategy-focused action show featuring an early rising general, Ikuta, and a merciless melee swordsman (what is it with swords and redheaded gals these days). It takes place in an alternate world where cavalry is still in use and rifles are considered the bleeding edge of technology. The show reminded me strongly of Valkyria Chronicles in many ways- primary protagonist, early plot progression, and the technological state of the world. 
 
Though not a complete masterpiece, the show tells a contiguous story and is led by a protagonist who for once is not an all-powerful Kira Yamato like figure. Unfortunately, the story isn't really complete; it only tells the first chapter of Ikuta's rise. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable ride and leagues ahead of other recent shows like Qualidea Code. 
 
Animation: 
Alderamin has a rather bright, saturated color palette, giving the show a bit of a happy mood despite the brutal reality of war. Shading is actually pretty good and you get a lot of pretty colorization effects in the background. Some of the battles feature a bit too much 3D CGI for my taste but I guess this is becoming the norm these days. I'm also not a particular fan of the character styling, honestly I almost skipped out on this show because of the facial drawing style. Emotions are fair overall but occasionally characters feel a bit stiff, especially the heroine Igsem and our princess. The show also feature miniature fairy-like spirit beings that specialize in generating light, fire, etc. They kind of look like less-cute, emotionless versions of Normins found in the Zestiria world. 
 
There is a large amount of action in this show though the choreography isn't anything special. Expect a great deal of blood in this show, especially whenever sword master Igsem shows up. There's a large amount of suffering and death in the show but they almost always spare you from the more grueling parts. This isn't a show about a particular character's invincibility in battle, the excitement comes instead from the protagonist's ability to tactically outsmart his opponent. Though there are a few suggestive scenes and Ikuta is a bit of a player, this isn't an ecchi-focused show. 
 
Sound: 
The sound package was a bit underwhelming overall. The show opens with a rock-based OP that badly needs a more focused melody and ends with an ever-so-slightly slower ED that likewise isn't particularly memorable. The BGM is mostly orchestral, supportive but nothing special. 
 
The show has a fairly good VA cast led by the commanding performance of Risa Taneda. We also have rising stars Haruka Chisuga and Inori Minase in important roles. That said, there are tons of guys in this show; expect a large amount of screen time to be taken by stereotypical military/politically-inclined male voices. 
 
Story: 
From the very beginning of the show, we hear the princess narrate that this tale is about the early career of Ikuta, who will eventually be revered as a genius general. Despite this giveaway plot shield, the show still manages to draw the user in through rather clever tactical troop strategies - it's like mystery but you're guessing how he'll overcome the next obstacle. Despite being a war-themed show, the mood is surprisingly light for a good portion of the time- whether it is the playful, relaxed nature of our protagonist or just inappropriate atmosphere is up to the viewer. There is a bit of political maneuverings and some hints at racial divides, but compared to A/Z or Schwarzesmarken I would say it's on the light side. 
 
The story can be roughly divided into four main story arcs, each with its own rising action and climax. There aren't too many cliffhangers per say but there are a multitude of nicely placed plot twists. Though we have a military genius in our protagonist, there are some pretty interesting curveballs thrown his way. The show ends on a ridiculously large cliffhanger that begs for more episodes, this feels like but chapter one of a long and interesting novel. One drawback is the huge number of unanswered setting questions, the largest of which is what the heck Alderamin and the unexpressive spirits that accompany everyone are. Thank goodness, the main plot is exciting enough that you won't have too much time to dwell on such questions. 
 
Character: 
If you're tired of the typical male protagonist, then Alderamin sure has a treat for you. Ikta may be a smart, cunning military officer, but he is also lazy, outspoken, and a flirt. He is as commandeering with the ladies as he is on the battlefield, though this is by no means an action based harem. He reminds me a lot of Welkin Gunther from Valkyria for obvious reasons, but is much more unpredictable in general, and thus much more interesting. Rarely in this genre do we see a leading figure so blatantly heedless of rank. 
 
The other characters are more average in general. Supposedly, the first arc introduces Ikta's friends, but honestly other than our redhead heroine, the others don't really get that much serious interaction or exposition. Even the princess is still quite the mystery at the end of the show. The antagonists are likewise fairly generic and some verge on downright inept. 
 
Though there are some character interactions and light development, don't expect any particularly deep relations to form; just look at how small a part Daru Nanaku and Suya end up playing. Honestly, if you're going to like the characters, you'd better like Ikta. 
 
Value: 
Alderamin is an above average show that does a good job of differentiating itself. Though production values are not particularly strong, Ikta and his interestingly unpredictability give the plot a strong boost. It is a bit annoying that the show leaves such a huge portion of Ikta's back-story unexplained, but there's enough of it to whet one's appetite. This is an entertaining watch, and I hope we'll see more of it.

    Ok, so the anime itself was short, it was slightly rushed and stacked. The plot was faint, but as a yaoi it was good. 
Story was good, because it was obviously a love story. The idea of it being held on a cruise ship and outside of Japan was good. The story takes place in an equally romantic place, Italy. And while the whole idea of an affair happening among the main characters has been done, this one didn't over exaggerate on that factor too much. In fact- the wife seemed mellow about it. The molestation is another element in the story that just presents another evil to the story I suppose, and I think gives another reason for the mains to fall even more in love. 
The artwork was,,,,,well personally to me amazing! The way both main men were drawn just brought out the sexiness and the beauty. Especially Al- his blond hair, so shiny- and Ranmaru's whole body, and his kimono- very nice. The backgrounds and scenery were nice too, and detailed. 
Both sound and character were 8. The majority of the sounds were either fighting or sex- oh and the woman's rage. It was decent and just made certain scenes stand out. Characters didn't have too much background, enough for the story and to the characters themselves. and how what was there was explained eventually and made sense.  
Enjoyment over all- it's yaoi...gonna love it. I appreciated the artwork and the awesome characters. I would recommend if you're into romance and something different from the usual one-shots. ^^

    two words 
Group Sex 
Imagine a city that decided to give up sex for 2 months and then the mayor said go!! That pretty much decides the kind of craziness that goes on in this hentai  
 
The first episode was OK, but the last three knocked it out of the park! 
 
Man if only THIS hentai didn't go overboard with the censorship it would have gotten a 10. easy.  
 
The story was awesome for a hentai. allergies that turn everyone on was a great idea. If only.  
 
The girls where amazing! art was great. Body positions where well thought out. 
 
My wife says for the female audience this one would be OK. The men weren't faceless dolls, they actually had some upper body to them. there where some scenes where the movement of the male private was pretty relish. the censorship for this Hentai was a pain.

    This an anime that should be appreciated by those who fond of anime. It shows a different side and genre of anime. Full of surprises, emotion and humorous. Rozen Maiden also define the actual meaning of drawing with details. Every inch and waves draws perfectly nice and satisfying your hunger for anime's art remedy. It also shows a variation in plotting an anime's series. Story stirring about : 
 
-Bonds of friendship and among siblings. [Main] 
-Each person have different characteristics that give our life more colorful even sometimes giving us much pressure. 
-Treasure our happiness without being lonely and felt imperfect.  
 
Sure does this anime rocks, colorful and though have lots variation.

    Violet Evergarden is worth the watch because I was so captivated with the story. It tells an emotional story of how Violet experiences living a hardworking and fulfilling life. As generic and cheesy as that sounds, I assure u this anime is neither generic nor cheesy. I personally like basically anything because I watch anime for entertainment, not really to think about what it means. HOWEVER, this anime was entertaining and made me think (kinda). It was worth the hype. Here are the memorable aspects to me: 
 
Ability to make me feel emotional:  
I like how Violet has a background of being in the war, and she is defined as capable because of her life experience. I can see it in the reserved and observant way she talks to people, and how she interacts with them. Watching her grow and help other people makes me so emotional because sometimes it's sweet, other times it basically pains me. This tornado of emotions sweeps me away. IDK how to phrase it without giving examples and spoiling the anime. Anyways, I cried and I hope that you do, too.  
 
Suspenseful:  
There are a lot of people and circumstances up for interpretation. I'm glazing over them and there are most likely clues and more hints to a deeper story that have flown over my head, but I know that I'm fine not knowing. I like that not everything is spelled out for you. The story consists of dialogue and also what is left unsaid. 
 
Etc: 
Art and music are relevant to the story. The art is vivid and the way people look is unique and detailed. You already knew the art and music were amazing, though.  
 
Watch this please! Also, the ranking is based on how I feel, not based on how it compares with other anime. Like I said, I'm really not picky and analytical.

    What can I say this anime was a perfect balance of Action/Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy , all four of these genres are shown so well and I enjoyed it so much more than the the other magi series. 
 
The main character Sinbad has such a positive personality that it makes me want to be more positive in real life. The action was well done for a fantasy anime, the adventure of the dungeons and different countries and the comedy of the crew that actually made me laugh out loud! 
 
This anime definitely sets the ground works for more seasons which it truly deserves!!! There is so much more to explore and to be honest I binged this whole anime in one day so I am sad there is no more :( but I really hope there will be another season, this anime is really under rated because it is a spin off series but to be honest you could watch this without having seen the other magi series. I feel like this should've been a 24 episode anime so they could explore the characters more cause I really wanted to see more adventures!!  
 
Lets all hope we get another season!!!!!

    Suisei no Gargantia, at first I assumed that this was going to be another common, standard anime that focuses on just nonstop battle of giant robots and snail aliens in space. To my surprise this proved to be the opposite.  
 
Story:6 
Art:10 
Sound:10 
Character:7 
Enjoyment:7 
Overall:7 
 
Story: The story of Suisei no Gargantia, even though it wasn't what I initially expected of a space giant robot themed anime, the story was still ""Fair"" at best due to it's lack of originality. The story lacked this because of how easy it was to predict the events that would occur based on the common plot line it follows. The beginning has its own arc and then the story progresses into a more slice of life, romance, themed anime. With the time spent on the character development of Ledo (the main character), who is forced to adapt to a society that is completely different than the one he grew up in. During this lapse of a main plot goal, the story focuses on Ledo's reintegration into a new society while bringing up the problems Ledo has with his past. When the story begins to move again, as I said before, the outcomes were very predictable, but that doesn't mean the Anime was bad. The way the producers went about bringing the resolution was a little different. The ending wasn't amazing, but it left a somewhat satisfied feeling.  
 
Art and Sound: I've never had to complain about the art and sound of an anime before, and the art in Suisei no Gargantia, being from the year 2013, was very good. The flow of the pictures whether during action or the slice of life moments, was exceptional. That's the main thing I look for in the Art, the quality of the drawings, and the flow the pictures have. The fan service that was included was put in there nicely. It didn't have a major role, but was  like a mint on your pillow.  
 
The sound was beautiful. The OP and ED were very nicely done, and the OST during the anime accompanied the mood of the moment well. To very few anime that I watch can I say, ""I need to download this"" and Suisei no Gargantia has a few tracks that I do want to put into my phone so I can listen later.  
 
Characters: The character development was mainly focused on the two dramatic characters of Chamber and Ledo. While Chamber's development surprised me a little bit because not only was Ledo was affected by the kindness and different atmosphere of Gargantia's population, but Chamber, an artificial intelligence, was as well. Ledo's personality change was mainly seen in his goals. As he went through a lack of purpose without the military and the Hideauze to fight, he found another meaning for life, and reasons to protect a society that is different from the one he knew.  
 
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this series mainly because of the characters, the plot didn't interest me too much.  
 
If you like anime such as, Asu no Yoichi, Hataraku Maou-Sama!, Oreigaru, or Princess Lover! they all have that kind of feeling of when the main character is suddenly thrust into a new society that forces them to adapt and change for the better. Although comedy wasn't a main focus in SNG, one can certainly find it through the interactions between the main characters and the society.  
 
Thanks for reading, 
-Nebarto

    Youjo Senki was an uncomfortable anime for me to watch as a man of faith.  Tanya's blasphemous rants against God were disturbing to watch, but I've heard worse in sharing the Gospel with others.  However, I didn't find the anime itself to be blasphemous, rather a poignant look at the battle between a God who desires to be worshiped and unbelieving Man, who refuses to do so.  I think it even gave a truthful look at how God reacts to those who rebel against him.  While the Church teaches that God is only love, he does have wrath, and he has brought calamities to those who would not believe in order to get them to believe in Him.  Which is the crux of what this anime is all about.    
 
I think you're going to have a different view of this anime depending on whether or not you actually believe in God.  I didn't become a Christian until I was 20 and spent years refusing to live for God, until he brought calamity into my life like Tanya.  I then submitted to Him, and realized I was a fool for not doing it sooner.  But, from that perspective I understand Tanya's desire to ignore God and live the life she wants to live.  But, as someone who found the peace in submission, I also felt like I wish she would just submit.  The most irrational thing for her to do, in her mind, would be the only rational choice.  She cannot win against God.  It was immensely entertaining to watch her try, however.  It made for a fantastic plot, especially intertwined with the horrors of war.  
 
As for the characters, this anime revolved completely around Tanya and her struggle with ""Being X"".  As such, the entire cast was pretty much cut and paste military grunts and generals around her.  The only other character to stand out from the pack was her assistant Serebryakova, a strangely bubbly character for the anime, that in spite of her persona, was able to get things done and not hesitate in battle.   
 
With Tanya being the primary focus, her character had to be excellent in order for this anime to shine, and it did.  While the anime says it's ""The Saga of Tanya The Evil"", in reality, it's ""The Saga of Tanya the Schemer."". Only twice in the whole anime does she do anything that could be described as ""evil"".  A more apt description of her would be someone who was callous and calculating.  She's no hero, to be sure.  She's not even an anti-hero.  She's basically a Nazi with villainous tendencies.  But, she's not particularly evil.  Although, you get the sense that she could become the Hitler of this world she's in and thus become evil.   
 
Another thing this anime excelled at was the battles.  Tanya leads a battalion of mages, that fight similar to Strike Witches.  These aerial battles are intense, especially each time she fights her nemesis, Anson Sioux.  The final battle of the anime was particularly amazing.   
 
The animation style of this is similar to Full Metal Alchemist.  Very good motion, decent character design, and full, rich European environments.  I was particularly impressed with the drawings that came at the end of each episode.  They were just photos of Tanya, but they were incredibly well done.  Something else that stood out to me was the sound.  The sounds of war were very realistic, especially the explosions.  It's a weird thing to notice, but the sounds of the explosions were deafening.  They sounded very realistic.  
 
Overall, I highly enjoyed this anime and am looking forward to a second season of it.  Especially if it ends like how I anticipate it to end.   I would definitely recommend it with high marks.

    I overall thought this whole movie. Was one word: AMAZING. It's the best i've seen in a loonng time. Everything was well put out. The whole story line made me not want to look away a second. I thought at first it was gonna be one of those movies where youd come out and say ""ehh it was alright"" but noo not this one. It left me with tears on how dramatic it was. and I loved ever second of it.

    My favourite and the best anime of all time. I really loved it. I really really love Mashiro, she's my number 1 waifu but i love this anime as a whole.  
 
The Story is just a masterpiece written by Hajime Kamoshida and illustrated  Keiji Mizoguchi . 
The art quality is really good for something made quiet a while back just what you'd expect of J.C Staff. 
 Every episode was fine paced and beautifully animated. The art quality is outstanding the most and although it doesn't have a second and didn't fully adapt the light novel it was really great. 
 
It has the best romance and comedy elements, at least for me. 
 
 I had best time in my life watching this beautiful anime.

    I found out about Soukyuu no Fafner quite some time ago, actually it was 8 or so years ago when i was looking for something similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Even though i heard many good things about the show, the stigma of being a very ""shounen ai"" anime kept me from watching it. With the airing of last years second season i decided to finally give this mecha classic a shot. 
 
The story about angsty teenagers piloting giant mechs against an alien invasion of so called Festums doesn`t deserve any awards for creativity, though i have to admit that the show throws a multitude of themes into the mix that were really interesting. The theme of young people being thrown out off their ordinary lifes, facing the grim reality of a war for survival, was very well executed and one of the strong points of Fafners narrative. Not only is the loss of innocence strongly emphasized in some of the shows calmer moments with the reocurring metaphor of changing into something else while piloting the fafners but also portrayed in the opening with childhood pictures of the protagonists. What sets Fafner apart from shows like Evangelion though is the stronger emphasize on the theme of family. Seeing how their parents struggle with the decision to send their children off, basically beíng child soldiers was one of the strong points of the first half. 
Sadly the shows focus drastically changes towards a pseudo philosophical approach to themes like existentialism, the meaning of life and the concept of understanding each other. Even though these themes aren`t uninteresting on their own, quite the contrary, they just feel not well executed at all to the point where the show starts to feel unnecessarily convoluted, even pretentious. There are many other shows (other than NGE) that dealt with these kind of themes in a much more cohesive and elaborate way (Rahxephon, Serial Experiments Lain, Zegapain). 
The story itself though, as earlier mentioned, is nothing special, to the degree of being quite bland if not for the convoluted mass of (never explained) terminology it throws at you. It`s as if the writers try to cover up their lack of creativity with pretentious terms and convoluted concepts. That may sound quite harsh but despite the beforementioned themes the story in itself wasn`t more then mediocre.  
If you are looking for heartshattering drama though, this show will not let you down. Without spoiling anything, Fafners reputation of being one of the most saddening anime is quite earned. Just be prepared for melodramatic death scenes... You know, the good stuff.^^ 
 
For death scenes to have any meaning the show of cause must provide characters that you can empathize with and Fafner, for the most part, delivers. Actually i would say this is the shows biggest strength, though also its biggest flaw. Let me explain: Almost all the side characters (and there are many of them) are not only characterized perfectly, with their own physical, psychological or emotional burdens to carry, but also go through some drastic character developement. This of cause ties in to the beforementioned themes of the loss of innocence and familiar bonds, as the show spends quite some time on how the characters live with and relate to their respective families. That of cause makes some of the dramatic deaths even more intense for the viewer as you really feel the loss those people must experience at that moment. Needless to say, i can only give highest praise for that accomplishment.  
 
But as great the side characters are, the main character did in no way resonate with me. This may be because of his quite ""shounen ai relationship"" with Soushi (even though a romantical relationship is never directly stated or even ""physical"", the show makes it quite clear that Kazuki shares a very ""special"" relationship with Soushi). Without insulting fans of the shounen ai genre, i have to say that this was very alienating for me, to the degree that i couldn`t relate to Kazuki at all. The problem is: He came off very unsympathetic because he was very distant to most other characters beside Soushi, even to his close friend Maya, who clearly had feelings for him. Well, nonetheless, i am quite aware that this is extremely subjective as fans of shounen ai would definitely like his relationship with Soushi. For me though it was hard to relate to Kazuki. 
 
In the art and animation department studio Xebec did a wonderfull job in bringing the beautiful landscapes of Tatsumiyajima island to life. That is especially true to the very detailed and vibrant scenic backgrounds. The animation itself was also really good for its time even though i have to say that the mecha fights weren`t the main attraction here. I didn`t expect the mecha-battle animation to be on par with something studio sunrise could pull off, but at times i felt that the mech fights were really boring and uninspired. The character animation though was really good. Yes, Hisashi Hirai`s character designs are a hit or miss, but i feel that they felt much more distinct in Fafner than in let`s say Gundam Seed. It also helps that there are some really creativ character animation sequences to underline certain chracter driven moments. 
 
The soundtrack was also amazing, even though there were some tracks that were more than inspred by NGEs OST. Interesting enough it was recorded by the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra. I also have to mention the amazing opening and ending themes by japanese artist angela. 
 
All in all i have to say Soukyuu no Fafner was an interesting experience to me, even though it had its flaws in the story and character cathegories. On one hand the story was quit simple and uncreative if not for the needlessly convoluted pseudophilosophical approaches, on the other hand certain social themes like loss of innocence, familiar bonds and how to live a peacefull life in a world under constant attack were mor than interesting. The shounen ai approach to the main character will certainly leave a sour taste for some viewers, but i think the excelent side characters mak up for it. 
Not to forget the intense, heartshattering drama, for what the show is known for.  
I`d say, if you`re a mecha fan you should definitely watch this show.

    This anime is one of the few who has brought me with his sad but at the same time overwhelming beauty and accompanying story tearful. 
 
Before I saw the first episode I did not know much about the anime and I've not much intended, but after the first episode I was excited by the idea that characterizes the anime. The other episodes could immerse myself completely in the world of Plastic Memories and me the feelings of the protagonists witness, which were marked by sadness, passion, love and laughter. 
 
But in the end it was the sad idea that characterizes the amines that made me do more than one episode to watch and which one the whole anime has accompanied over and made him what I can simply described as brilliant!

    I peeped this anime because the mandem were watching it and said it was an xd type of show and I was bored at 12 am. The first episode was intriguing my headtop enough to make me watch another episode, which was more intriguing than the last episode otherwise I would have dropped this anime like Sanjam as a baby. 
 
I rate how mans were battling each other wif love cause even in love you cant take no L's, know that. I thot Ishigami was gonna be a Sasuke TO but then he just turned into a weird incel type mans like Affan.  
 
Chika was just ur stereotypical idiyappum type anime shordy, but she was okay sometimes; ion know how tf she thot of that clock strategy when playing cards thats actually a mod thonk. 
 
I didn't really rate when Shinomiya became e-girl half way through the show I liked it better when she was roasting Shirogane cause it reminded me of how my parents fought and beat each other while I was growing up.  
 
Hayasaka kinda coocoo as well but I rated how she made Shinomiya link and build with Shirogane when she was being a dumby. A likkle bit sus how she told Shirogane he could run a battry ting on Shinomiya while she was sick but I'll overlook that cause mans have seen Sayuri b4. 
 
The ending was modddddddddddddddd disappointing; episode 11 was literally just Chika and some mans eating newdels which was jokes but had me thinking the anime was more than 12 episodes since they decided to waste the 2nd last episode on random filler bullshit. The last episode I thot there was gonna be gang shit but they just tickled my schmeat and left me hanging with a boaner. I didnt like how throughout the show they built up this hype for the inevitable confession from one of the two and then it never happened. It makes sense plot wise cuz they bof stubborn waste yutes so I rated that they stuck to their stubbornness but I still wanted to see some cute gay shit or at least Chikas bobbies vro....

    Once again, Afro Samurai received poor reviews all around because ""its storyboard is shallow"".  
 
No shit sherlock.  
 
Afro Samurai is NOT a anime you watch if you want a deep storyboard, its an anime you watch if you want to see ass kicking. And lots of ass kicking.  
 
Afro Samurai has good animation, great fight scenes, an amazing soundtrack that totally fits the character and good tidbits of humor inbetween all the fights to keep you enjoying this anime.  
 
This is the anime for you if you like mindlessly awesome fight scenes, crude humor and more awesome, violent fight scenes.

    ItazuraCrap is of all the anime I have seen the one I detest the most. Sure, there are tons of stupid, annoying, brainless shows out there but this one exists in a craptastic category of its own. There is so much wrongness stuffed behind the mask of a cute shojo that it makes me want to get myself into a Tardis and erase every sign of this anime ever having been created. Let's dissect the wrongness… 
 
Story: 
The story kicks off clichéd to the n(th) degree: plain, ditzy girl is unrequitedly in love with the School Prince™. Now, this kind of setting can be charming given the correct ingredients: the right characters and the right dynamic between them. Far from being a good recipe, this anime requires an enema after viewing. The first few episodes were predictable enough in that the girl got her face shoved in the mud and suffered through lots of expectable humiliation. However, I was looking forward to the time when she would pick herself up, grow as a person and win the affections of her love interest. Respectively, I was expecting the love interest to stop being a jerk and show that he was actually a good enough person for the heroine. Instead, I got an S&M show. The heroine could not get enough humiliation and outright abuse, even at a point in the story where you'd think she'd get some love and affection. The love interest was such an abusive, unlikeable, insufferable asshole he only needed a Nazi uniform to make him complete. Honestly, if any viewer actually believes he is the ideal love interest then s/he is in desperate need of psychiatric evaluation and should not be allowed to care for small pets or children.  
About the only positive thing I have to say for the story is that it moves fast. For the shojo genre it moves at warp speed 9 since it moves past high school and college and professional life. I suppose it shows more but I didn't make it past episode 15 so I wouldn't know. Nor would I want to know. I’d rather unclog my toilet.  
 
Characters: 
Kotoko: this is the kind of non-role model people should steer their kids away from. She has no self-respect, no life, no goals outside of loving the Jerk. I kid you not, she is a pushover and a doormat like no other. She even chooses her career only to complement the career the Jerk has chosen. She suffers untold humiliations and abusive behaviour because “she loves him“. Her only purpose in life is to love the Jerk? I wish I could put her head to the meat grinder and feed her to my cat. Then her life would have a better purpose.  
The Jerk: has a name but I'm not going to use it. He's just the Jerk. He's supposed to be very pretty and very smart, so smart in fact that he has the supergenius ennui flu and views the rest of humanity on the same level as cockroaches. His “love interest” included. At no point does he become someone we can root for. You know, someone a girl in her right mind would actually love or even like. I wish I could put his head to the meat grinder and feed him to my cat but I’m afraid she’d just vomit him up.  
 
By no means is this relationship the only problematic relationship in this anime. Throughout the show we have the message that boys should “smack their bitch up” and that the only good woman is the woman that is submissive to her man (re: total doormat). If you look closely, you'll see that any female character that is not a doormat (or does something against the wishes of her man) is portrayed as an evil bitch from hell. Honestly, I've seen hentai with healthier relationship portrayal.  
 
Animation: 
Below shojo mediocrity 
 
Sound: 
It’s there.  
 
Overview: 
Lighten up, I hear you say, this is just a romcom. No, it's not a comedy. It's a mean, sadistic piece of shit. You're not laughing because what you see is funny, you're laughing because you see a character being humiliated. And it's about as romantic as child brides.  
Seriously, if you still can’t spot the shit compare this turd with romcoms like Skip Beat and Lovely Complex.

    When it comes to Gakusen Toshi Asterisk or the Asterisk War, there are a few things that can go side and side for me. On one hand the show wasn’t so bad as I thought, considering the way the show went wasn’t as terrible as I thought, in fact; I will say that there were actually a few things that I liked about the series and this would include my personal evaluation, some few of the expositions and the way they handled the battle tournament aspect which was really nice. On the other hand however, the show still has some flaws that holds the show back the scales which is not really a good thing considering having some issues to my standards can cause some difficulty to recommend the show (including someone that’s looking for battle tourney series of this type of genre). So you would have a mind from what I am going up towards this review, but let’s just see if Gakusen Toshi Asterisk of The Asterisk War is considered a show to at least be watchable even with the issues or it’s just considered a bad experience. 
 
Story:  
 
To give a thought about the show, let’s get into the synopsis. 
 
 In The Academy City on the water (also known as Asterisk) is the world’s biggest battle entertainment, “Star Wars Festival.” The young boys and girls belonging into six different academies made their wishes Shining Armaments in their hands. 
 
Basically in a way, our main protagonist Ayato goes to this said academy by an invitation from the Student Council President Claudia Enfield and suddenly he stumbles upon Julis, the main female protagonist. 
 
In other words as how people call this show “Star Wars: Harem Edition”.  
 
Basically the start of the show goes to the same old generic trope, this usually happens and depending on the person this can go both “let’s go and just wait” or towards “we’ve seen this before”. Of course we’re going to see this every time, this is usually one of the trends actually, however what matters is the execution afterwards that introduction. 
 
To start things off towards the anime, I will say I will give some props towards the show for giving at least enough information without feeling spoon feeding like Mahouka, because it in cooperates enough info without feeling left out for me. It’s something I like about the show because it has a way to not get me bored enough or feel quite lazy about it, just giving at least enough details to know about said mechanics of the world and the aspects of the show so it would give a more decent idea of how it goes. However exposition can depend for people actually, for me I find the way they did the info nice without feeling like I can’t comprehend stuff. 
 
Also the show doesn’t really go and become too dragged out for me to get straight into the main events, it actually goes and build up the training at least for the actual things happening. 
 
To not go into further details on the anime, even if the show goes to a generic way start as the episodes passed by, you would sooner or later notice that it goes to a degree into a different direction, where it mainly focuses on the Ser Veresta the battle tournament, which was the main event that the series has built up from my previous statement. 
 
The show also focuses on the teamwork aspect along in battle tourney trainings and battles, now that’s actually cliché however for my personal eyes the way it’s handled for say the least it was good enough considering the relationship between the two main characters and the other supporting character, but talking about the two main characters' partnerships, the teamwork between them weren’t as bad at first, as the episodes passed by the relationship in terms of that was nice enough however not one of the best to say the least. 
 
Also to keep another note the anime doesn't focus on the romance (since it has a romance tag in) and for my eyes it's kind of saying there's a romance but my previous statements are their main focus of the plot. 
 
Pacing for the show seems rather nice and also perfect and suiting for the show considering for me if it does rush somethings I think it could break and destroy the buildup for the main event the anime has made throughout the anime and it just doesn’t go well for it. Just my personal thought on the matter. 
 
Interactions are not one of the best but they’re not as bad as I thought for the main cast of characters. In all honestly and this comes as rather personal but I liked some of the moments of the anime where I actually giggled upon. 
 
To say the least the anime has some sort of nice things to go across however there are somethings that could become out of place for the show. 
 
For one thing sometimes I personally think some the fights could have been less predictable in a way although there were a few nice surprises along the way, it’s just at times I felt like it could have been done better for me, although the fights aren’t really bad in all honesty, also predictability it’s just depending for my perspective on the viewer. 
 
The second being the couple of clichés being around the show which kind of affects some few things and little aspects of the anime because although it’s not a bad thing it just how its utilizes kind of ticks the viewer off in some way to say the least for my personal eye, and as well with the fan service it just depends on the person as well. 
 
The third issue being the main character, although this all depends on the viewer's eye, Ayato basically beats everyone. Anyone in the case, but I guess not to the point of being on the same level as Tatsuya or Kirito I suppose. I will state why down below in the characters category, and in the end of the day, this comes for different people. For me I felt rather annoyed with it a bit but it's better off than having one person giving a one hit K.O badly. 
 
And the final part being the final episode of the first season. In other words the final fight, while the final episode was very good overall, I can't deny there was something that came out of place and that's actually something buggy and I really don't know if they can explain that later on in it's second cour. 
 
In the end of the day for the story department the show isn't really unique with its story in terms of the whole plot but the episodes made up for it decently enough for me, and to at least have this considered as passable due to the balance of entertainment and the exposition. The series isn't also one of the better written series since the writing of it can be considered either way simple and not everything so special in it's way. It's not also supposed to be a series that it needs a lot of stuff to make it better, in fact adding too much in this case would break the show, so that for me at least the story is passable enough for people to enjoy. 
 
Characters: 
 
I wouldn’t want to explain much in this department considering when it comes to anime characters in this type of genre they’re not quite special in all honestly. They are your stereotypical archetypes and cast that you have probably seen in the previous shows. If you have seen anything like these of course. However it doesn’t really mean they’re bad either for my eyes unless how they’re really presented. They are just… mediocre to a degree in the overall curriculum of character departments, which is a weak point on the matter. 
 
Ayato being the main male protagonist is shown as your stereotypical dense protagonist with to say the least, copy and paste personality to say the least. However the only thing that makes him a little interesting for me would be his actual backstory that was brought after said episodes, in which he actually has a limit of using his powers due to that flashback being presented in the anime. It’s nothing very unique in all honestly for my opinion but that at least is more interesting to see along. I give him bonus for that. 
 
Julis being your main female character which she acted like a Tsundere girl at the show from the start, I somehow managed to like her in all honestly because that was of course strayed away to a degree for some reason. She also has a motivation in this case in the anime which makes it more reasonable of why she was participating in the events in the first place. Now saying that doesn’t mean it’s nothing special for her but as I would say for Ayato, she gets bonus at the very least. 
 
The other two girls from the main four characters, Kirin and Saya are your stereotypical Loli character and Kuudere, the only thing I would say about them is that for Saya, most of the time she makes me laugh with her commentaries and at the same time for Kirin, she doesn’t really fight in all honesty (if I can say) like how the others’ weapons. The only bonuses I can give is that they work together as a team and that’s something nice. 
 
 
The other girl Claudia doesn’t really become presented or relevant most of the time in the first season and she only appears in some scenarios, other than that I would say I like how they put her later on in the anime however it’s quite a sort of disappointment. 
 
The supporting cast are quite forgettable with the exception at the moment for Irene since she did got a backstory at the final episodes, while it was kind of a awkward move I found this quite passable enough. Everyone seemed used as some sort of characters just for the sake to be there, unless they make them more relevant in the second season of the anime series which quite frankly I was impressed it got a second cour, which could mean more things would come for the show. 
 
That’s why I said the characters are overall mediocre to be honest. Yeah.  
 
Art/Animation:  
 
If anything I would say about the art, I would say the art style for this series is not quite one of the best out there, however it does look decent enough for its quality. As well for its background art it looks nice enough that it also fits with the designs of the characters. 
 
The designs are not really original to an extension however the designs looks above average enough and not that much complaining about it to say the least. Each character looks dandy in a way. 
 
For the animation standpoint I will say it’s not one of the most fluid animation out there, but surprisingly enough it’s not anything ground breaking to my eyes. If anything, it has a minor amount of choppy moments where the most it seems rather passable enough. It also can be an eye candy towards the viewer and depending on the person watching if you like battle tourneys you might enjoy this one. 
 
In the angle standpoint they actually do a decent job with the angles and the moments when the characters are fighting against one another, it doesn’t feel off for half time but for me half the time I would say I didn’t liked how it actually looked. 
 
Overall I suppose I could put the animation and art category as being one of those good ones overall because it really doesn’t look that bad, and it has some little decent stuff into it. 
 
Music/Sound:  
 
I would say the music isn’t one of the most memorable things around, however the music has a mix of techno and a bit of instrumental ost at times at the fights, where it seems really enjoyable and at the times it’s quite catchy when watching. At the same time I would say the few comical osts seem very fitting. 
 
As for the sound I would say nothing stands out from the sound department as in the effects, however they’re put at the right place and time without feeling quite cringey. 
 
For the voice acting tone department (since by the time this review is released it will be reviewed with tone of the Japanese dub) I wouldn’t say the voice acting was bad, however they’re not all that great either in a way. Though I give props to the voice actors to say the least because it fits with its cast of anime characters and it’s rather fine to say the least (despite me hating the voice actor for Ayato but not as the person voicing but for the voice for the character itself) 
 
As for the Opening and Ending songs both are one of my most favorites of the season considering it goes to my personal taste to my eyes. In all honesty music is subjective, let’s say that.  For the Opening it gives a catchy J-Pop vibe and the tone of the OP fits with the show, as for the ED it gives a harmonic in a sense feel when hearing it, and the English sounds right. 
 
Overall Enjoyment: 
 
To be quite honest I liked the show a lot, this is rather a personal income due to the previous points above that the show did benefitted in a way that for me I felt satisfied with the outcome, in the end we’re getting a second cour of the show, so let’s expect for the better or for the worse. Just to say. 
 
Overall Conclusion: 
 
Would I recommend this show? This all depends on your taste on anime actually, or the genres in itself. If you want at least a show that buildups the events bit by bit (for this season) you can give the show a shot actually, and maybe you would have fun with this, however I wouldn’t recommend it to people that do not like anything like that from a series, especially for those that hates or dislikes the ecchi/harem battle tourney. To conclude, I will leave it at your hands, you’ll decide.  
 
Until the second cour, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk.

    Watcher beware! 
 
I knew the anime was going to have a lot of sad moments from the numerous memes online that meld this with other classics like ""Angel Beats"", ""Clannad Afterstory"", ""Little Busters"", and ""Anohana"".  I was ready for some feels, but instead all I received from 7 episodes was a ludicrous plot and forced tragedy for the sake of creating forced pain and drama. 
 
The whole plot that surrounds the idea of androids that have a set lifespan/memory/personality but are fully treated in every way as a human, especially emotionally, is just plain annoying and not even remotely believable.  
 
Why would anyone invest so much emotion into an android knowing they exact date they will leave you and why would anyone allow them to raise children or act as surrogates for family members? 
 
I tried to suspend my loose grip on reality so that I can try to enjoy this anime full of demented logic and plot holes, but I just wasn't able to suspend reality to that extreme. 
 
I really did give ""Plastic Memories"" a full shot, but in the middle of episode 7, I promptly dropped it and am much satisfied with my decision.   
 
I'm not a hater of tragic anime.  Heck I've watched ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and have kept a somewhat faith in humanity even after watching it.  ""Plastic Memories"" just made me not want to emotionally invest in any character once you understand the plot premise because you just know how it will go.  People will emotionally invest in androids that will ""die"" on a specific time and you will be hurt.

    I've seen a lot of slice of life anime themed around gaming. This one manages to stand out among the noise. I went into it not expecting much but was literally surprised at episode one. 
 
It's the way the show surprises you that makes it so great. Sure there's a plot that spans the entire season, but the feel of each episode is quite independent of one another. They play with your expectations. It's an anime that will both defy and reinforce stereotypes, and then make fun of itself for doing so.  
 
The situational comedy is great. You will cringe for sure, but not so hard your muscles cramp! I found myself shouting at the characters on multiple occasions. You like them all, but, much like Tsurezure Children (which also aired Summer 2017), you pity them for their lack of being able to express their feelings and all the glorious miscommunications that result. 
 
On top of all that, there is actually some good commentary on how many gamers actually feel and some of the pitfalls of the gaming industry. It's an enjoyable ride!

    Fate/Zero - 6/10 
Fate/Zero 2nd Season - 7/10 
One major let down of Fate/Zero is it's characters. Plain and boring, sometimes they do things for absolutely no reason behind it whatsoever. Only interesting characters are Archer, Kiritsugu Emiya (So Edgy that Matoi Ryuko seems like a fairly balanced person) and Kirei Kotomine (Especially Kirei literally the only reason to watch the show). The rest are just stupid and look like they've been copy-pasted from some saturday morning cartoon. Shitty pacing issues, an actual filler episode (the show is only 13+12 episodes long, get ur shit together). Action scenes look patheticly low-budget and are normally only 20 secs long before some fragment with characters talking for hours and hours (witht he exception of bike chase with Saber and Rider, that was epic). The Story is ok, even though it's presentation is shit. In the Pilot episode we are shown how Mato is the guy, the main char and then he is just erased from existence for next 10 episodes. The show then concentrates on telling us how Saber is the strongest class and shit, and yet for the next 20 episodes it's showing us the exact opposite of that. Music in the episodes is ultra shit, didn't even notice there was a soundtrack.  
What i liked was the interesting and even somewhat original setting, which was also reduced to nothing in the following episodes. Best moments of this Series is ""Wow did he just kill a character off"" moments, even though they get you sometimes, mostly you will just brush it off because THE CHARACTERS DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE YOU NOT GIVE THE SLIGHTIEST SHIT ABOUT THEM, though sometimes they fail and you may feel feels at tear inducing moments like in episode 20. Although for another positive comment the show somehow does keep you entertained in a way that ""what are these fags gonna do next"" but if you're that easily entertained you may aswell watch cheap american comedy series on budget tv channels.  
You know what? I just really liked the opening cinematics, i think i literally enjoyed LiSA's singing in the opening more than the actual series. Guess what? They got rid of that. 
The characters actions just make you think you're in a trash comedy movie. The Tension only appears in the 2nd half of the series. On the good side there is an original setting and concept aswell as tear-inducing ending which i respect, but the rest is just Naruto-tier, SAO-tier utter trash.

    Here's the deal with Major. Despite its length and despite your opinion on baseball, its awesome. Watch it. 
 
Major is a simple, but well-thought out story following Goro Shigeno as he journeys through life with baseball. The story is what you'd find in many sports anime/movies; try hard enough and succeed. Major pulls this concept off so well that it never feels stale, and includes some very good, unexpected plot twists, especially later on.  
 
The place where Major shines most is the characters. Everyone is so interesting and well-developed, including back stories and front stories. They have very unique personalities with multitudes of reasons as why they play baseball. Over the course of the 6 seasons, everyone grows literally, and in characters, from child to adult. Its refreshing to see where they go with their lives after each season. 
 
Sound and art are good. Everything looks as it should and sounds as it should. Voicing is very well done and believable. The art also well done. Scenes that are meant to look intense are given extra detail and Shigeno's fastest pitches are drawn, showing off that speed. You can feel how fast he pitches many times. The only gripe I have is that they re-use his pitching animation a lot. I understand pitches have a certain form they never break from (as a basketball player, I know this), but it would've been nice to see more variety in how they animated his pitches while showing his same pitching form. Also, sometimes the lively, cheering fans can look pretty stoic despite a major homerun. Otherwise, everything is very good. 
 
All in all, Major is a must-see for sports fans. Its well-done and a great pleasure to watch. Regardless of your opinion of baseball (I've never liked baseball in the past), there's so much to take away. Great characters, great story, an overall fun time. 154 episodes, one movie and one OVA sounds rather daunting, but I can say this; Major will have you hooked from very first fastball.

    Never thought that I would ever write review of any anime or manga... 
But I am surprised how low can be people's taste. 
 
I was happy when I see 9 score, I thought I got chance to watch masterpiece and thats was total disappointment, bullshit. 
 
Maybe I would give 8 or 9 score to Demon Slayer when I discovered anime for the first time, when I didnt see any bloodshed before and it was absolutely new world for me... I dont believe that any Veteran anime lovers will give that anime more than 6 or 7 points. 
 
hmm... mal asks me to write longer review, so  
Story is most likely good, buy story telling is total bullshit, you always know what happens, for example evil says ""heh I am so strong his katana wont manage to cut me"" and you know that that evil will die by that strike in next second, also too much talking, too unnatural expression, I want to vomit when I watch it, so why I still watch? because 9 score got me, I was like ""hey maybe in next episode something amazing will happen, otherwise how that anime could get 9 score? it must amazing"". thats how I watched maybe 8 episdes, but I am not going to watch Demon slayer anymore, I mean I finished all animes which I ever started, even when I disliked them I always finished. and yet I cant bring myself to finish watching Demon Slayer, total waste of time, and its shame how it is on 18th place. total shame

    Story: It's typical girl have a crush for a boy, who is famous in his school. On Sunday is Valentine's Day and Mami-chan want to give some chocolate to Ishida-senpai. But does she have enough courage to do that? It's pretty clished, but also really cute. 
 
Art: It seemed like someone have just draw something using paint. So it's not really good, but it's in someway really cute and fits to story. 
 
Sound: Character have good voice's. It fits fine by the characters and heard fine to me. There wasn't any background music, but it sounded good even without it. 
 
Character: When this special takes time only nine minutes, watcher didn't get a good touch for characters. Mami-chan is cute and shy, Ishida famous and Koko-chan is a good friend. But they were also really cute and that's why I gave five points. 
 
Enjoyment: Even if the storyline is pretty normal, I liked it. Story was so cute and characters too so it was really enjoyable to watch this.

    After watching this anime, I really can't help as to wonder as to what is the main theme of this thing; is it the female cahracters struggling to find a way to ease their boredom co'z they're assigned in some outpost which is too far away from any action  or is it the bugle call ""AMAZING GRACE?"" So, how do I rate this anime? Here's how: 
 
Story: Fair 6. 
 Ok, so the genre of this anime are the following: Military, Shonen, Sci-fi, Musical, Action (appred only in the last 2 episodes) and Comedy (just a little bit). However amongst the genre only the musical part is most prevelent pertaining to Kanata's bugel calls, everything else are trivial and a mediocre  of ""Make love not war"" kind of thing. 
 
Art: Poor poor 3. 
Question: what the heck was the artist thinking when he or she got inspiration to don the Helvetia soldiers (feamle charcters inculded) in a Nazi style uniform, which by the way inculdes the utility vehicles and the guns that they use except the tanks, also the Roman soldiers were donned with a wrong kind of uniform, in reality, during WW2 the Italian (Roman) army donned an Olive Gray uniform and not the typical WW2 Soviet Style uniform, frankly everythings that were drawn were composed bits and pieces of something during WW2 that the artist of this anime seem to based it from ..   
 
Sound: Dreadful 2. 
 
If you're talking about the opening theme, I hate it. 
If you're talking about the various bugel calls inculding the ""Amazing Grace,"" I say it's a bit of a Sacrilege (pataining to the ""Amazing Grace"") to even make it part of the anime. The said bugel call is reserve only to a solidier, fireman or any member of the law enforcement unit who died in the line of duty. There is a diffrent bugel call which is used to call for a truce, and I'm surprise that the author of this anime doesn't know it. 
 
Character: Mediocre 5. 
 
It is not unusual for a female soildier to be regulated for guard duty or any non-combat duty. So, if the setting is in some European country then all charcters should sport european names, particulary in German, unfortunatly most of the charcters still have Japanese names like: Kanata Sorami, Rio Kazumiya, Kureha Suminoya and Noel Kannagi. On the other hand, the supporting character Aisha Aldola is not a typical roman name, The character's name is more like a combination of French with a touch of Spanish, also she should be speaking Italian or latin instead of German. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: Fair 6 
 
As in fair enough to be watch by all ages. 
 
 
Trivia: During WW2 the Soviet Red Army utilizes women for sniper duties.

    What a series.  
 
I love these drama, romance & action anime that take place in the future. But not just that. The art is outstanding, as well as sound effects & music. The protagonist ""Shu"" is really sympathetic at the start, but changes throughout the series.  
 
Much is going on, but the story is easy to follow and to understand. Characters are not just beautiful (Related to ""Art"" mentioned before), but are also special. Every character has its own personality, which makes it easy to find a favorite.  
 
In general the series is absolutely enjoyable, but could have been more exciting in some episodes/places, but that is alright. 
 
I really recommend this anime. Even its number of episodes is perfect.

    Sword Art Online Ordinal Scale was released in Cinemas is Australia on March 9 2017 for the general public viewing. This is the first time I’ve written a review but I’ll do my best to give you my honest opinion about the film. 
Story: The story was good but not great, we see all characters in this film but not all are well executed perfectly, some characters were just there for the sake of it. The story is also pretty predictable on most parts even if you haven't read the Manga. 
Art: I believe A-1 created the art sequences for this film. they also created the CGI on Fate/Stay night Unlimited Blade works so you know it’s going to be good. The CGI is amazing, battle scenes are also well executed 
Sound: Sound was pretty good as well, the sound and visuals are in pretty good sync, though I didn’t give it a ""9"" because I personally believe that they wasted LiSA's song ""Catching the Moment"" and used when the credits roll, I believe they should've used it on battle scene instead of just putting it on credits. 
Character: I gave it a ""7"" because the story focuses on other characters but not all, a few are just shoehorned there for the sake of it which is why I gave it a ""7""  
Enjoyment: Well this is Sword Art Online, again, they nailed the battle scenes and action, sound and music is being great and Visual are very pleasing 
Overall: Sword art Online Ordinal Scale is an enjoyable film with great visual, sounds and art but character issues and a predictable Plot makes it a great but not an amazing movie to watch

      Clannad after story... This anime taught me everything, the impact it had on me was life changing. Clannad After Story will teach you everything, encourage you,make you laugh and love the characters like they were your closest friends. It will then tear you down, rip you apart piece by piece and make you realize how important certain people are... Then it will build you back up again, put the pieces back the way they were and make you love life and everything about it!  
 
 That was meant to be a brief description of what clannad after story is about.. haaa im not joking when i say clannad after story will have a very strong impact on you. Unless you don't have a heart :) You will probably cry just a little... Okay your gonna cry a lot, I did. Both happy and sad tears! 
 
~Story~ (Alright im trying not to have any spoilers here so bare with me) 
 Clannad After Story is a second season to the original Clannad and is different in so many levels. The series starts with a couple of character arcs on characters who were kind of in the shadows in the first season. Then however unlike Clannad (which is made up of mainly arcs alone) there is then a big climax that leads on from there. The characters of focus, Tomoya and Nagisa, begin to develop their relationship which leads to a somewhat happy but somewhat catastrophic event which is were the tears normally start to kick in. This climax introduces a new character called Ushio and the drama starts. However the ending involves an unexpected, supernatural twist which changes everything!  
 
~Characters~ 
 The characters of focus are of course Nagisa the female main and Tomoya the male main. The other girls who had there arcs back in season 1: Kotomi, Tomoyo, Ryou, Kyou and Fuko are mainly background characters but are still as loveable as always. Now Nagisa Furukawa, shes just genreally a lovely character her role in this series is indeed veyr significant. Tomoya, he's just so inspirational, one of my favourites! He started as an average, bored teenager who had no motviation at all to this wonderful, courageous and brave adult and his character development is just lovely to watch! And of course Ushio, she's just adorable! She's strong and fearless like her father but has the sweetest personality like her mother :) Nothing else can really be said without giving spoilers :/ 
 
~Art~  
 What makes this anime even more beautiful is the fact that all these beatuiful paths, cities, fields and places are real places in Japan! They have been defined and enlightened and every scene just seems like a work of art, something you would hang on your wall or paint on a canvas. The use of lighting is also fantastic and really helps portray the atmosphere and the time of day making the scene even more breathtaking! 
 
~Music~  
 The opening song is catchy and well composed also the art is brilliant! The other various soundtracks used like ""The palm of a tiny hand"" work perfectly with the scenes they are allocated to and sound simply beautiful! Also Dango Daikozuku is also interpreted in their often. Some may think ""euggh thats songs so annoying"" thats what i though at first. But after experiencing Clannad After Story you will probably tear up just listening to it! And the ending... Wow. Its cute but a complete mood killer, its upbeat and happy but utterly ruins the atmosphere. Not a bad song though 
 
Now to summaries my review i have to say i have been so inspired and motivated by this anime! I get this unexplained feeling just speaking about Clannad After Story, it has made me want to live life to its fullest! I can't really explain the impact! Tomoyo has gone through true despair, he hated life and thought nothing of it. He grew and expereinced some heart shattering events and learnt a very valuable lesson along the way and is a very inspirational man! Clannad After Story will teach you the importance of friendship and family! It definatly deserves more attention! 
  
 Okay i think im done now! So message me your thoughts or tell me if your agree or disagree with this review if you want :) Thanks for reading!

    This is a very fun and cute movie. 
 
This is a very entertaining movie, I was pretty much smiling the whole time watching it. All the characters are very likeable from the five year old boy Sosuke and his mum Lisa, and even the minor characters like the residents of the rest home. The movie is well paced with a strong eco friendly theme throughout shown through many amazing shots of underwater scenes, and them being destroyed by man. The importance of love and being together is also emphasised in the movie, shown really well with Ponyo, Sosuke and their families.  
 
Constructive feedback is appreciated :)

    Another isekai, shield hero impressed a lot in his first episode, bringing a more ""dark"" theme to the series and to the protagonist, not only that but bringing the theme revenge, prejudice, injustice, hatred, betrayal something hardly seen in a isekai, besides Naofumi being an interesting character, not being that good guy, nor of those more ""powerful"", having to use strategies to defeat his enemies, but, that is thrown out and still apply the various cliches of isekai ... Tate no yuusha tells the story in which 4 heroes were invoked from another world to protect this one who invoked them of ""waves"", events that would bring diverse monsters to attack and only of them would have the power to defend them. Well, when Naofumi gets his first ally, Raphtalia, a demi-human, a child still on top, he is rigid and right, after all it serves precisely to help him, but at no time is he cruel, there is every moment he is protecting, caring, and educating, the problem here was: Naofumi sees her as a daughter basically, but then she grows up (still ten years old, but looks 20) and starts looking at Naofumi as a romantic interest , why? At no time does it make it visible to have such an interest, so it does not make sense. Following, one of the points that attracts in the work, is its beginning, with all the drama and desire of revenge of Naofumi by Myne and the King, since both accused him of acts that he had not committed, a whole background is created behind this hatred, reminding the viewer at all times how much Naofumi hates the character, also causing the public to feel this hatred (remembering that at no time did this cause me any kind of feeling, after all, Berserk preached in me much better the concept of betrayal and hatred). Speaking of the characters, except for Naofumi, who has some interesting traits, all the others are horrible, seriously, Raphtalia is submissive to Naofumi, obeying every order of him, without a trace that the highlight of any girl of a harem Isekai, the second companion it's Filo, my god, that boring character ""goshujin-sama"", I do not even need to talk about why it's not attractive, as I said before, Naofumi was brought to that world with 3 more heroes, (the names have no relevance here), during the first wave, these 3 heroes are in charge of defeating the boss and Naofumi is in order to protect a village that was being attacked, okay, these heroes have relevance, Naofumi can get more powerful than the three of them together, because apparently he knows how to actually use the shield (even just putting some things inside it, and being deprived of most of the information), nothing Naofumi becomes strong through the knowledge of his weapon, but that is ridiculous, in the waves following the other heroes have zero importance, and having idiot personality too, the spear is a slave of the woman who betrayed Naofumi (this practice in Brazil is called ""being cattle""), the sword is a cosplay of Kirito (having even the same voice actor) and the bow trying to be the holder of reason, but in the background being only more characters with crooked ideals. Another serious problem here is the balance of power per episode, in one part Naofumi is having problems to face a respective enemy, but in another he wins another easily, which in theory would be stronger, this happens in the last two episodes, which also are quite disappointing, with Naofumi hesitating to shoot down an enemy who clearly had intentions to kill him, for no reason, since at no time were they ""friends"". And the biggest disappointment was (spoiler ahead) the conclusion of Naofumi's revenge, as I said, a whole plot was created behind it, of hatred and thirst for justice, for everything to be solved in an anti-climatic way, Myne for example will continue to follow the hero of the spear and the King will probably try a coup d'etat. ""I'm going to call them garbage and bitch"" and they will live free but lost their titles of nobility, Myne for example will continue following the spear hero and the King will probably try a coup. At least the anime soundtracks are good. (I apologize for my spelling mistakes) 
 
(PT-Br) Outro isekai, shield hero impressionou muito no seu primeiro episódio, trazendo um tema mais ""dark"" a série e para o protagonista, não só isso, mas trazendo o tema vingança, preconceito, injustiça, ódio, traição algo que dificilmente se via em um isekai, além de Naofumi ser um personagem interessante, não sendo aquele cara bonzinho, nem daqueles mais ""poderosos"", tendo que usar de estratégias para vencer seus inimigos, mas, isso é jogado fora e ainda aplicam o diversos clichês de isekai... Tate no yuusha conta a história em que 4 heróis foram invocados de outro mundo para proteger este que os invocou de ""ondas"", eventos que trariam diversos monstros para atacar e só deles teriam o poder para defendê-las. Bem, quando Naofumi consegue sua primeira aliada, Raphtalia, uma demi-humana, uma criança ainda por cima, ele é rígido e com razão, afinal ela serve justamente para ajuda-lo, mas em nenhum momento ele é cruel, há todo momento ele está a protegendo, cuidando, e a educando, o problema aqui foi: Naofumi a vê como uma filha basicamente, mas então ela cresce (ainda possuido 10 anos, mas com uma aparência de 20) e começa a olhar para Naofumi como um interesse romântico, por que? Em nenhum momento ele deixa visível possuir tal interesse, então não faz sentido. Seguindo, um dos pontos que atrai na obra, é o seu inicio, com todo o drama e desejo de vingança de Naofumi por Myne e pelo Rei, já que os dois o acusaram de atos que ele não havia cometido, é criada toda uma background por trás desse ódio, lembrando o espectador a todo o momento o quanto Naofumi odeia a personagem, fazendo também que o público sinta esse ódio (lembrando que em momento algum isso me causou algum tipo de sentimento, afinal, Berserk pregou em mim muito melhor o conceito de traição e ódio). Falando das personagens, exceto pelo Naofumi, que possui alguns traços interessantes, todas as outras são horríveis, sério, Raphtalia é submissa ao Naofumi, obedecendo cada ordem dele, sem um traço que a destaque de qualquer garota de um harém Isekai, a segunda companheira é Filo, meu deus, que personagem chato ""goshujin-sama"", eu acho que nem preciso falar o porque dela não ter nada de atrativo, como eu falei antes, Naofumi foi trazido para aquele mundo com mais 3 heróis, são eles: a lança, a espada e o arco (os nomes não tem relevância aqui), durante a primeira onda, estes 3 heróis se encarregam de derrotar o boss e Naofumi fica afim de proteger uma vila que estava sendo atacada, ok, esses heróis tem relevância, acabou, pois depois por algum motivo Naofumi consegue ficar mais poderoso que os três juntos, porque aparentemente ele sabe como realmente usar o escudo (mesmo só colocando algumas coisas dentro dele, e sendo privado da maioria das informações), nada contra o Naofumi ficar forte através do conhecimento de sua arma, mas aquilo é ridículo, nas ondas seguintes os outros heróis tem zero de importância, e tendo personalidades idiotas também, o da lança é um escravo da mulher que traiu Naofumi (essa prática no brasil é chamada de: ""ser gado""), o da espada é um cosplay de Kirito (tendo até o mesmo dublador) e o do arco tentando ser o detentor da razão, mas no fundo sendo só mais personagens com ideais tortos. Outro grave problema aqui é o balanceamento de poder por episódio, em uma parte Naofumi está tendo problemas para enfrentar um respectivo inimigo, mas em outra ele vence outro com facilidade, que em tese seria mais forte, isso acontece nos últimos dois episódios, que também são bastante decepcionantes, com Naofumi hesitando em abater um inimigo que claramente tinha intenções de mata-lo, por nenhum motivo, já que em momento algum eles foram ""amigos"". E o maior desapontamento foi (spoiler ahead) a conclusão da vingança de Naofumi, com eu disse, foi criado todo um plot por trás, de ódio e sede de justiça, para tudo se resolver de forma anti-climática, em que simplesmente a tão esperada execução é trocada por: ""eu vou apelidar eles de lixo e vadia"" e eles vão viver livres, mas perderam seus títulos de nobreza, Myne por exemplo vai continuar seguindo o herói da lança e o Rei provavelmente vai tentar um golpe de estado. Ao menos as soundtracks do anime são boas.

Isshuukan Friends caught my interest off a recommendation from one of my anime viewing sources.I was a little iffy to get into the show based on the art style, but as soon as I started watching it that quickly changed. What I got was a good slice of life anime story.  
If you don't want to go through all my personal views and get on to the main wrap-up go down to the memorable anime section of my review. 
Personal Ratings: 
 
8/10 Main Character Mindset 
Throughout my history of anime watching, most of the shows tend to be a romantic comedy just like Isshuukan Friends. With all those animes beginning to gather under the belt, you start to realize some of the commonalities between your male lead in a RomCom. You usually get the perverted, dense character hosing those down around him with the blood erupting nose as he gets that touch of a girl's magical oppai. This lead however was quite the opposite. Yuki is a rather average highschooler just looking for friendship of a mysterious, cold girl. Not looking for boob, just a friend. He's goofy and shy, but knows how to handle certain quizzical situations. He's a good, relatable, and a different character from a good amount of RomCom leads. 
 
7/10 Romantic Qualities 
The romance begins towards the second half of this anime. Just enough to really get me by, me being someone hard to please as far as a romance between characters goes, this anime barely hits the spot. I do like this anime's cuteness though. Saki by far is one of my more favorite characters of the anime for her goofiness and her cute forgetful ways (Only being beat by Shougo, the guy is pretty damn funny and realistic), and the adorable interactions between Yuki and Kaori. But, don't come into this expecting over the top romance with the highest uguu factor you can expect, from the title you should understand the show revolves around friendships. 
 
10/10 Fan Service 
There is none! It's great! Trust me i love seeing fan service placed justly throughout an anime, but Isshuukan Friends doesn't need it. This anime takes a more serious tone, although being a comedy, and focuses on real romance and friendship, not just upskirts and tits all up in your face. 
 
8/10 The Plot 
The idea of the story is pretty good in my opinion. A boy who likes a girl has to deal with the constant reset of her memories and try to help her remember their great times together. The pacing is alright, i do feel like certain things were rushed (I never read the manga so I don't know how it worked there), like the first episode and it's dive into the fact of her losing her memories. The story progresses pretty well in my opinion, showing character progression and introduction of other faces with in the story.  
 
Is This A Memorable Anime?(No pun intended.) 
In my opinion this anime isn't on I'll remember compared to some of the other shows I've watched this past summer. BUT! This anime is pretty interesting. It has a good assortment of characters. A problem I have is that I liked the side characters more than the main ones. Shougo and Saki were actually my favorite pair in the series. Although this show isn't memorable is it worth a watch? Yes. You have a good lead on a romcom. No fan service thrown at you in the whole show unless you count the two main girls getting dressed up as stuffed animals arousing(WHICH IS COMPLETELY FINE!), It doesn't have a bad moment. The animation looks great and the characters are interesting. A good idea for the plot, this show is a good watch. I give it a 7/10. If you have any questions about the anime be sure to message me on my profile and I'll  be sure to answer, and check out my other and future reviews! 
Game.Set. And Match!

    I enjoyed this one, a facinating series about people with powers, it has some great action moments, followed by some wonderful just family moments.   I liked it. 
 
Story:   It's cute, it comes off as more action packed at the start, but as it progresses it becomes more about just family and these kids with powers. 
 
Art:    The art is nice, especially later on, I can't say much without spoiling, but I liked how creative it got in the last few episodes. 
 
Characters:  I think this is where it shines, it has a nice cast, each with their own personalities, a bit of drama that worked, and some hard moments dealing with things that just worked for me. 
 
Enjoyment and overall:   I liked it, I would recommend it, I say if you want, give it a shot.

    With the oncoming rush of fantasy worlds forcing their existence into the lives of would be heroes, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar takes a step back from the inexhaustible series of standard heroes. 
 
Ever wonder what happens to the NPC generic characters you pick up in a game such as Final Fantasy Tactics?  This is more their story, the bottom of the litter who get left behind as the strong push further into the world they have found themselves in.  The party takes their adventuring at a snails pace, attempting to accept the world they have found themselves in. 
 
Welcome an archer who can't fire arrows properly and stands in the frontline with a dagger. 
 
A thief that can't DPS or assassinate properly and has taken a tank role. 
 
A Knight that is afraid to tank. 
 
A Healer that holds the front line despite being the core of the team. 
 
A Mage whom has the utility of a support from League of Legends. 
 
A darknight who off tanks and DPSs (doing his job correctly i might add) 
 
 
The cast is set and the growth of these would be heroes is a long road. 
 
The pacing for the story is fairly slow, but is meant to capture the essence and the very atmosphere of these characters.  They are not good at what they do, and the series attempts to make it painfully obvious as they grow into goblin slayers. 
 
I found myself grinning as the characters steadily grew, doubtful of their complacency, and on edge as they fought for their lives.  If you're looking for a series to slowly wind into the World of Grimgar should be a welcome home.

    Full Metal Panic! 
Another anime that let me down, i had high expectations towards this anime because how well praised is, and from the beginning to the end this was just fine but not what they say it is. 
 
Story 
The setting of the anime is kinda interesting, the problem is that is not well developed and not to mention that the bland characters didn't help at all, with an annoying MC Chidori Kaname who has constant angry problems that comes out of nowhere, and her mood doesn't make sense, why bitch to the person is trying to protect you, and she acts like if he doesn't have a military job, poor Sousuke, he's sent to protect her because she is somehow special she's a ''Whispered'' and they explain a little what they are, but not what we want to know and they didn't explain how and why they exist, a lot of unexplained topics and the problem of the why wasn't explained is that there are a lot of filler boring eps, a lot of inconsistencies are found in this anime and again Kaname is really annoying, i hate that kind of characters, i like tsunderes but to the extent of being stupids, no thanks; There's a guy also, Gaul (whose reason of being a bad guys isn't explained) he's hard to kill even when he explodes, it's stupid how he always survive without any hint on to how he did it, i don't know why people are saying this is romcom, i don't see the romance in here, an attempt, yes but i don't get why people say they liked that aspect of the anime, makes no sense. The story is ok but not well presented. 
 
Art & Animation 
The animation sometimes can be good, but it has something that i didn't like, and i don't know what it is, the mouth and sound sync was weird, almost all of the time there were weird camara angles and unrelated shots for example when Sagara was fighting other AS mechas and all of a sudden shots of Chidori in the beach (?) but i think overall is ok. 
 
Sound 
The VA is good but sometimes sounds bad, maybe because of the animation of the mouths being looped to do the same movement, the OP is bad and skippable just like the ED and the background music wasn't fitting at the beginning but after 10 eps. it gets a little better and good and to mention that one song reminded me of an A-Team song, overall it was fine. 
 
Character 
Most of the characters you don't care if they could be taken away from the anime and never appear again, because you won't miss them. 
-Chidori Kaname is a meh character at the beginning but with her attitude becomes a bad one, she is useless and doesn't stop to be angry at Sousuke for some reason; She all of a sudden gets angry or gets angry at stupid reasons and even gets angry at him just because he's working on a mission where people die and that affects him but she doesn't ask him how he feels rather than that she gets mad at him, she doesn't have a background of any kind, what a bad character. 
-Sousuke (Isegar) Sagara is a person that doesn't have social skills and that can be conflictive most of the times, but he's like that because he's a soldier since he was a kid, he has little background, just flashbacks; He's a good character but nothing amazing, i liked that he finally got angry at Chidori and somehow at the end he had more social skills. 
-Tessa Testarossa is a sweet girl that wants to save everyone and she in fact is the captain of Mithril or was it just the Ship with the weird name? i don't remember, i liked her more than Chidori who in fact falls in love with Sousuke too and is more open than Chidori about it. 
Then there's the rest of the cast that are meh, nothing special worth the mention, i thought the characters were ok jus for Sousuke and the Cap. Tessa. 
 
Enjoyment 
There were good eps. that i enjoyed but the enjoyment was just fine for me, i wanted to finish the anime already, too much eps. and no explanations.

    Story: I really liked how the story was laid out, because there was a consistent overall storyline that was mixed with just the right amount of plot twists: not too many, but not too little. 
 
Art: A lot of the older gundam series have crappy art that makes me want to puke. However, this is one of the exceptions. I really like how the characters are designed, and I applaud the way the mobile suits are drawn. 
 
Sound: The OST was OK, and most of the time it was the right music at the right time. The bigger part of this sound review is about the openings. Daybreak's Bell may be well liked by many fans, but it did not really appeal to me, since its background guitar and drum music was not really as appealing compared to other anime openings. However, Ash Like Snow is awesome and would make a good opening for many psychological action animes. 
 
Character: The characters that I mainly focused on were Lockon, Allelujah, Setsuna, and Chris. Chris is basically your happy go-lucky and sometimes absent-minded girl. Lockon is basically your average badass with a slice of cool. Setsuna is a person who is dedicated to ending conflicts and doing stuff for the better good. Allelujah has a slice of sociopath (Hallelujah) and is kind of like Shinji Ikari in that he basically just hates his life and tends to go berserk. Unlike Shinji, however, Allelujah wasn't forced into Celestial Being. These characters were special and I liked it. 
 
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this series, since it provided a large amount of juicy action involving mobile suits. It also had a slice of psychological and dark stuff, making it a very good anime 
 
Overall, I think this is a great anime and that it is worth watching and remembering.

    Even though I love yaoi, I didn't put this OVA on my list when I read the summary... This is because it says to be incest. 
 
But, because my sister already saw it and said it wasn't to bad, I tried watching it too. 
In the beginning I still had the feeling of 'Ewl! This goes way too far!'  
However, I just tried not to think about the man and teenager being related and in the end it seemed quite logical to do so, because it really isn't that much incest in the end. I won't go into details about this, but if the incest is the only reason for you not to watch this, just try it and watch it till the end, and not till you finish the first episode. 
 
I loved the OVA. It was cute and had a beautiful story. I also love this way of manga/anime art and I recommend it to everyone who loves yaoi.

    Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi, A Bridge to the Starry Skies gave a promising start but as it progressed it came out to be a generic harem. After reading the synopsis i thought it might be something different from usual harem but after first two episodes the quality really started to deteriorate. 
 
Story: 6 
Story has nothing new to offer and is highly predictable in fact the synopsis given for this anime itself tells the whole story. 
 
Art: 9 
It has a high quality art and you can watch this anime for it. 
 
Sound: 9 
Sound is also one of the positive aspects of this anime. Starting theme is really a nice one. 
 
Character: 7 
It has all the characters of a classic harem. Male protagonist is somewhat better in the sense that he is not indecisive so it is not as frustrating as other harems turn out to be. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Though an average anime but enjoyed it since i like animes of this genre. 
 
Overall 7: 
It is a lighthearted anime and does not get tense at any point. So if you are bored of watching serious animes and just want some typical harem, itchy, romance you can watch it. But don't watch just for romance genre as it never gave that feeling of a romance anime.

    I've always been a sci-fi person, and this anime certanly attempted a new perspective in the future. 
 
I enjoyed the concept of the story as well as the individual characters. 
 
Glad though it only lasted 13 episodes, it felt like thats all the story needed.

    So the only part I actually enjoyed where the last 5-10 minutes with Senjougahara. The problem is that: 
1. they miss the whole thing that made Monogatari a cult anime: the mystery, the puzzle, the interesting interjections. There is none of that. It is all so boring that you feel the dread and want for it to be over 
2. All the ""reveals"" are already well known by both us and Araragi from the previous installments but he seems to have forgotten them for no reason 
3. The ending made absolutely no sense and made Araragi way too powerful 
 
In a word the show looks like a bad fanfic . There are times when story tellers lack inspiration and try to fake it. They produce a lot of low quality material like this one. A similar thing can be said for Stephen King recent novels. 
 
Basically if you are the person that accepts a show only because it has you favorite characters and is created by the same creators as the previous work you may like this. But if you are someone that cares for quality and asks questions and wants something actually interesting you will find it as a way too long filler. If this would have been one episode 20-30 minutes I would have been ok with it. But stretching it to 6 20 min episodes is way too much for a filler.

    first things first i didn't like OPM probably bcoz i had too much expectations from the hype it was getting and got disappointed in the end although it wasnt a bad show. 
 
so here goes my review: 
 
story 2/10: 
    well its same pattern till the end a bad guy comes kicks all the hero's asses to show how powerful he is then our super op mc comes and defeats him with one punch with ""so easy"" face just to be funny. Well it worked as a gag at 1st then i got bored of it. 
 
Art  9/10: 
       Art was nice nothing to complain here. 
 
Sound 7/10:  
        Sound was decent too. 
 
Character 5/10: 
        Everyone had their unique personalities which was nice but dont hope for any character development.our 2nd mc Genos was their to get his ass kicked 1st b4 mc comes puts everyone in awe how easily he beat bad guy to even make people think that he cheated lol. 
 
Enjoyment 2/10: 
        Didnt enjoy it bcoz of my high expectations which i gave up after 3 ep then i was watching for comedy which didnt really had much impact either only the action was good to enjoy 
 
Overall  6/10:   
         After all my complaints it was still a decent show.They couldnt have done much with the concept they chose of one hitting every bad guy. everything was done properly but it gets boring after 1st few ep ,showing same patterns which makes us easily predict what to expect next.

    Ok, so here's my opinion: 
Let's be honest, we need an opinion of someone who has seen HoneyWorks ever since they started making this saga or, at least, started watching it and comprehended it. 
 
First of all, story: 
I'm really pleased at all of this, Haruki is a guy who loves making movies as his passion and thanks to the influence of his brother, Chiaki. Miou is a girl who's not only shy, but brave when the moment catch her, she loves painting as a passion even though she categorizes it as a ""hobby"". Both of them had already appeard in a lot of HoneyWorks PVs (including Hatsukoi no Ehon, their story's PV) as well as in the past 2 movies: ""Zutto mae Kara suki Deshita"" and ""Suki ni naru sono Shunkan wo"", so people may already had a hint they both liked each other, however, it is not necessary to lean on the movies to know their stories, but otherwise, compliment. Haruki and Miou have a really good relationship but never get to cross their own 10cm distance, that's where the title comes in action ""Our love has always been 10cm apart"" (clever, since the lyrics of Hatsukoi no Ehon touch the same words and topics) 
This series, not only cover and adapts cleverly the songs and manga we've already seen, but also develops the story in its own with some thing we hadn't seen in anyways (like when Haruki got his own self-problem), however, a lot of songs were not covered and were a vital part of the story like Inokori Sensei and Hatsukoi no Ehon -another story- (which takes the song's same name into the point of view of Haruki) but aside of that, everything went nice and smoothly. 
 
STORY: 9/10 
 
Art 
Sincerely enough, Lay-duce made a better job than Aniplex with the art of the characters, making their characters less ""shiny"" and more plain (in a Lovely Complex style or Kimi ni Todoke), however, most of the scenes were made out poorly. comparated to Yamako's (Mogelatte and Rokuro as well) great work as an artist for Honeyworks' PVs and Mangas. But, it went smoothly and felt really soft and shoujo-like, so, I'm not really mad nor sad about it. 
 
ART: 8/10 
 
Sound: 
Perfect enough, I loved how they inteded in making songs with famous utaites like Amatsuki, and some character songs like Kiokemasuka, I'm amased by the content of the albums the group already released (surprisingly enough, all songs appear in the anime except for Romeo which appeared in the latest Honeyworks movie). Another fact we can add is that they didn't use the Chico w/Honeyworks formula for the opening, instead, they used the in-universe idol group ""LIPxLIP"" with the song ""Nonfantasy"" sung by Kouki and Nobunaga. And, you may not know it, but I love when the seiyuus sing in-tone, and the ending felt perfect, it fitted enough for the anime (and the last episode's ending was amasing, a reconstruction of Hatsukoi no Ehon, in the point of view of Aida in the present [this is not counted in as a spoiler since it was announced way before and the song released the same day the anime went airing]). Simply, delightful. 
 
SOUND: 10/10 
 
Character: 
*EXPECT SPOILERS IN THIS PART, READ WITH CAUTION* 
Unlike the last 2 movies and the mangas, here we see a develop in character atmosphere, like Haruki after he realized he was only carrying out his brother's dream instead of his own, driving him crazy. Or Aida when she discovered about her savior, trying to escape from Haruki's wrong reaction. This is not the ""sugar sweet sweet"" couple people were expecting, no, this time, the characters had a deep connection with the background story, giving influence in their decisions. 6 episodes were enough to make my heart race and develop with Aida and Haruki, the best couple HoneyWorks could have (FUN FACT: They were planned to be the only couple in the Kokuhaku no Oto saga, but thanks to their PVs success, they expanded the whole saga universe) 
After everything that happened, they both changed in their adult ages, both of them grew up and knew how to get afront the ""10 cm"" that were keeping them away. 
 
 
CHARACTER: 10/10 
 
Enjoyment: 
I TOTALLY ENJOYED THIS ANIME, I was waiting for it ever since they announced it, and totally fell in love with various soundtracs (even though some of the tracks are re-used from past movies). HoneyWorks' fixed the errors they made with the movies, and made them look better, one thing for sure that I liked the most was the abscense of some characters like Hina, Kotaro and Sena. ¿The reason? Obviously enough, because of the focus this couple was getting (I'm still proud of Gero because of his TV-anime debut as a seiyuu). I can't wait for HoneyWorks' next proyect.

    School Days is like watching a bunch of terrible people (with the exception of Kotonoha - God bless her soul) do retarded things and then get their asses handed to them for doing retarded and terrible things to one another - additionally, this applies heavily to the main character of this show, Matoko. 
 
Nothing about this show is in any way well written - many of the characters are quite shallow, and not a lot of depth is put into them, and many of the twists and turns of the plot can be considered outrageous and out of place, especially towards the show's conclusion. Even the visuals (art, animation etc.) isn't anything to write home about (with the slight exception of episode 4 and the last episode, which for some reason had their visual direction improve in quality). 
 
Though this may not be the case for all viewers, the only reason I enjoyed this was because of how terrible it was - it was terrible enough that I laughed at least once in every episode, in spite of the heavy atmosphere it would often try to convey. I'm not sure why, but it may be due to my sheer disconnection with the events of the story that I see everything from the outsider's view. 
 
As Charlie Chaplin did say once, ""life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot,"" and I can't think of a better example of anime than School Days. 
Please note that in no way am I praising the craftsmanship and writing of this show - if you're a person that loves ironic viewings and watching anything for the shits and giggles, then I definitely reccomend this show for you, as you will indeed have a great time. 
 
But for others who are seeking a genuinely good narrative, I would suggest to steer clear of this for now - unless the ancient memes about nice boats start to pique your curiosity.

    If you have ever had a wild night out: the kind that pushes you to the brink of destruction and gleeful, impossible, slightly magical victory all at once, finished with a morning of inner peace and illumination, watch this show. It's a timeless lesson in trust, risk, fortitude of the heart - which all sounds a bit too epic (though not unlike Studio Ghibli's subtle moral lessons,) - but the life-affirming story saturates after it's over, like the fine wines the characters freely consume.  
 
Animation sometimes appears crude and the drawing lazy, though that's part of storytelling and perhaps necessary to convey a feeling with only a single 'episode'. Several plots unfold at once, but they are not difficult to grasp and play well with each other. 
 
One of the few anime that I would add to a physical collection.

    Boobs, everywhere... 
There, thats grenadier in two words, but since i'm such a nice guy and enjoy spending my time writing reviews for free \(*_*)/ I will elaborate a bit for you at home. 
 
This basically follows a super well-endowed ditzy blonde chick as she runs around trying to prevent fighting and violence in general. How does she plan to do this? by stripping them of their armour, which is meant to be taken the dirty way, but after so long the phrase just gets really lame, but yeah thats her plan. To do that she decides that flashing smiles will solve all the problems, guess what, it doesnt. Instead she stops people from fighting by shoving her boobs in their faces, which in my opinion would work far better; if nothing else, it would work on me. 
 
Character wise, shes about it with the exception of some samurai dude who litterally brings a knife(or katana in this case) to a gun fight. Yeah, everbodys runnin around packing heat in the form of machine guns and he walks in with his sword, and is all like ""l got this guys"", no he doesnt, the blond chick with the bazookas ""has this."" 
 
The story is as weak as a pot of three day old coffee, and involves minimal story line progression. It makes sense at least which is one thing it has going for it.  
 
To be completely honest, the ONLY reason that l kept watching after a certain point was the boobs, but l still almost got bored with them. My opinion is that if you like boobs, you'll love this; if you love boobs, you'll go nuts for this; if you are like me and enjoy lots of boobs, but need a story behind the to keep you interested, you will probably watch this whole thing but then realize that it came to nothing. As with everything in life however, you just need to try it yourself and see how you feel.

    WATCH OUT! This review and rating is based on Hentai scale. Parental discretion is advised. 
 
Okeee, my 1st review. Anyways. Here goes nothing =) 
 
The title of the Hentai is ""Rape! Rape! Rape!"" I could stop writing right now, because that is simply everything what that Hentai can give you! 
 
STORY 
The story is just a disaster.I mean, i'm a Hentai-Fan and since so many years have passed, since the first Hentai came out, you may think something like ""OK. Maybe there are coming more Hentais with a cool plot."" and then u watch Rape! Rape! Rape! and the world disappears in front of your eyes. The whole plot is about a guy with a mask, who rapes many girls combined with some fetisches, like lactation and (of course) schoolgirls. That's all. That's the story. There is no background to the characters or stuff like that. And about the first ""Gang bang"" stuff in the beginning... i gues i'll never figure out what this was all about, maybe they tried to get all fetisches at once... u better don't ask me about this. 
Rating: 2/10 
 
ART&SOUND 
The art, and the animation is quite good, nothing u can get angry about. But here is the problem: It's like the producers were like ""OK. The viewers also need to get raped, so we do it like this: We give them no story, no backgrounds and a standart animation and art quality."" I guess that were the thoughts of the producers. 
The sound is also standart, as well as when it comes down to the sweet, japanese dubbers. So that's the highest rating for this anime: The art and the sound which is just ""standart"". Oh, i forgot to mention the ""Soundtrack"", but hey, this Hentai is called ""Rape! Rape! Rape!"", so what  do u expect? =D 
Rating: 5/10 
 
CHARACTERS 
All right. You got some sweet random girls. And a guy with a mask. That's everything you can say about the characters. As i already mentioned, the deepness of the characters is as deep as the ocean... but only if the ocean decides to be a mountain. I mean, come on, the title of the Hentai is Rape! Rape! Rape!, so do u expect something else? If yes, then you should check and improve your english skills :D 
Rating: 2/10 
 
OVERALL 
The only reason, why i'm going to finish this Hentai, is just because i had the GREAT idea to finish every Hentai, i started watching. But i'll give everybody a handshake or a handslape who is also willing to finish this, when he saw the first episode. No doubt, i bet that there are Hentais out there who are a lot worser than this one, but this one is another example what u never should lay your hands on. And, as i already said, the only good thing about this Hentai is the art and the sound, but everything else is just ""Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!"". 
 
So my overall rating for this piece of rape is 3/10 
(Why 3? Because i think there are Hentais out there who are just poorer than this one.)

    Most people would say this anime is hilarious...and it is. I mean, boy gets flushed, becomes king of some weird place, tries to bring justice to the world in some very weird ways. Only, I think it's very good because it's not just hilarious. 
 
Somehow, it's hilarious but also tragic. But not full on crying your head off tragic. It's almost like admist the comedy and the light side there's this dark side seeping out.  
 
The plot takes really unexpected twists and turns. But not so sudden that you're taken by total surprise. You're hinted at it, but you only actually realise what you were hinted at until something actually happens. Although this mainly happens at the end of the anime, where things start to go wrong, which is also when it's most interesting.

    Despite the obvious flaws of having a generic, weak, uninspiring plot and being filled with fan-service-y scenes... Not to mention it has harem... 
 
Despite all of that, I thought the characters in Asterisk are pretty cool. They have thoughtful discussions and face their problems in a reasonable manner, unlike most other shounen anime where people collide and scream at each other for no apparent reason. The MC also isn't annoying and emotionally naive like, again, most other shounen anime's MCs. Those traits for me are a big plus. 
 
Even if the story itself isn't interesting, I think you could give it a shot if you're prone to liking those alternate, cyber-ish world-settings (e.g. if you somewhat liked Mahouka).

    The title suggests it to be a random anime, the beginning gives you the image of a random goofy comedy anime honestly i didn't expect much out of this anime but it all changed once i began watching this series. 
 
5 episodes into the series all this begins to change and the story becomes more emotional and heartwarming and at sometimes gives you a nostalgic feeling of how it felt like when we were kids. 
 
""Chuunibyou"", i looked up what it meant on Google and this was the answer that i found:  
 
""A Japanese slang term which roughly translates to ""Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome"". People with chuunibyou either act like a know-it-all adult and look down on real ones, or believe they have special powers unlike others. 
 
This is a common stage in growth; for most people, it happens--you guessed it--around the 2nd year of middle school (Grade 8 in Japan). However, the problem is, there are some grown-ups who have this symptom."" 
 
Just looking up this meaning made me grin like from ear to ear you know why? 
Because it was something that most of us have experienced in our school lives, whether it be in a severe form of mimicking your favorite TV character or in a cooler form of trying to be a wannabe music artist and developing newer ways to look good like your idol. In any case when we remember this some of us just smile and think ""that was fun"" and some of us think ""i wish i had never done that, i just want to roll over and die"". 
 
Now coming to the anime what does the above written extra info have to do with the anime?? EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!! 
 
The entire series is about a boy named Yuuta Togashi who has overcome his chuunibyou and Rika Takanashi who is still going through it somehow. The two meet each other on the night before their 1st day of highschool only to meet in the same classroom. Rika contacts Yuuta and calls him Dark Flame Master (Yuuta's former alter ego) and tells him that she has a wicked eye which is responding to his dark aura and she wants to form a contract with him, this makes Yuuta embarassed but somehow the two become friends a nd are drwan to each other. 
 
Well that was the gist of the story of the anime but now we come to the main point that why should you watch this anime?? 
 
well its simple............. Its amazing! 
 
When one looks at Yuuta's character he/she is reminded of their own phase of childhood imagination. The plot turns really do remind you of the points and realizations that made you stop with your imagination.  
This anime will get you in the heart, it will make you laugh, will make you emotional and remember your own childhood and bring back memories that seem like a distant dream, and make you wish you could be a child again. 
 
WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!

    Tldr; It’s good.  
 
If I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear. - Mary Shelly 
 
What’s better to watch at the late midnight if wasn’t horror story? A whole new premise that brings you amidst of folklore, that’s for sure to haunt us. When I watched the first episode, I got this little tingling vibe that this series actually frightens me. The show itself, promise you a very realistic horror that overwhelmed you with fear.  
 
The story is altogether from a collection of horror stories, one by one with their own unique than each others, to show you how interesting horror story can be. People always afraid of something that is unknown to them, either ghost or monster, simply because we fear what this ‘unknown’ entity could do to us. But before you know it, you’ve already delved deep in each stories like you’re actually the main character to see how one reality can be a door to what you’ve fear the most deep inside your heart. Every story get it own stage, and when the least you expected it, the worse is already in front of us. It could be something grotesque, creepy, and gross but then again this is actually what we’ve hidden deep inside our heart. The show just make way even when we try to deny it, the imagination of how scary it actually is, already running in our mind. The realistic of the premise itself seem so unreal, yet we still can’t avert our eyes from the screen, completely oblivious to the fact that we are already being captivated. In the end the stories just keep diving depth to the path where we just wish to see more, to see how it plays until the bitter end.  
 
We’ve got to see more than what we can actually imagined. From the curser to the victims, all played their role so natural in this unbelieving horror. The feel of pain and anguish with overall despair has been combined altogether to one piece. It freaks you out to a certain level, which is something rare to see nowadays. Every story got a different characters, but it always interesting to see how each of them being toss into a box of fear. Not to forget the monsters, where all bears the same feels, fear. Each of them portrayed different kind of fear, but it still related to one another in the hearts. How ugly can it be? It’s truly a nightmare to behold. 
 
While the animation is not that good, it still manages to blow what is means by a horror story. On the other hand, I really love the OP, it’s certainly good and interesting work of art. By no means, I really love it. 
 
As a big fan of gore/horror I truly enjoy this piece of animation. The shows had both upside and downside, but to certain degree it is indeed successful to present the horror theme. I had my share of fun, the horror run wilds, that you truly being captivated. Amazingly, you just wish to see more, how a glimpse of horror can be this interesting to see. At the very end, it is truly a works that worth admiration while not completely perfect.

    the story was great. really liked how the story went.  
I like the fighting and the determination of the main characters. 
I don't like the director and the doctor for Alisa but the story was still good. 
I would like to watch season 2 if it comes out. 
The story is kinda like attack of titans. 
I would like some romance in the anime. 
Overall, only one thing: I ship Alisa and Lenka, they are like soooooooooooo cute together and i would hope if they could get together sooner or later in the anime if there is going to be season 2

    Violet Evergarden has been an emotional roller coaster from the first episode until now. The first few episodes introduce the character and the world around her in a way that certainly isn't amazing but, is still quite good, while the rest of the season I'd consider to be outstanding. The overlying theme of the show is with out a doubt love. Love of a significant other, love of a mother, father, daughter and love of ones self. As each episode ended, I found myself craving to watch another episode every time because, I knew I would feel an abundance of emotion. Happiness, sadness, anger, fear are just a few of the things I had felt throughout watching this show. Now is this show for everyone? Absolutely not, but for myself? I have found what I believe to be one of the greater  anime's I have ever seen and I simply can't wait to watch more.

    I am really sorry that I am not gonna write something like a formal review. I prefer and try to give you what I taste right now in mind and heart and also what does this anime gives you at the end. 
 
Right from the middle of the second chapter you just got a ox sit on your chest(Well its an expression in turkish but I hope it will make sense to any reader (: ) and never move from there. The story telling method, the sceneries, diaolagues they just all perfectly fit; every moment you are shown the story it just takes you into the world of theirs and their world is just full feelings. I think the director and the artists real outdone themselves because this anime's a type is that grabs you and makes you feel them inside your heart. Well for example at the end of episode 7 if you can't get the soul, feelings and mind of miyako then you just don't have a heart!! and there are many moments and expressions like that in this anime 
 
A must see for everyone who loves romantic animes!

    Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch aka Lelouch of the Rebellion is set one year after the failure of the Black Rebellion and the supposed death of Zero. Unsuspecting high school student Lelouch, oblivious to his rebellious past as Zero, stumbles upon a scheme on his life and the life of a mysterious woman known as C.C., who reveals to him his forgotten purpose and his ""true"" self. Destroying his assailants and declaring himself Zero once again, Lelouch sets out to finish what he started.(Synopsis from Anime News Network) 
If you haven’t seen season one i recommend that you go do that right now before even thing of watching this season as they are both directly related to each other. You will have no idea of what is happening, its deep enough as it is. 
 
Sound 8.5/10 
The opening and ending songs of this series OP #1: ""O2"" by ORANGE RANGE,OP #2: ""WORLD END"" by FLOW, ED#1: ""Shiawase Neiro"" by ORANGE RANGE, Ed#2: ""Waga Routashi Aku no Hana"" by ALI PROJECT were all good solid efforts with your usually heavy metal/rock themes. They are nothing to complain about but they can do better. However, the background music throughout the series was exceptional. The suspenseful senses contain slow, ominious music while the school scene contained light hearted, fact paced music. It is truly amazing how the music various just enough to match the temperament of every scene perfectly. The finally ending was also commendable, “Continued story” by Hitomi Kuroishi is only placed in the last episode and allows your to reflect on what happened throughout the series. The slow classical music is unintrusive and reflective, perfect of the finale. 
 
Story(9/10) 
Throughout the story there were numerous plot twists which ssignificantly altered the storyline and circumstances of the main characters, especially Lelouch. It follows the classic formula of best friends are your worst enemies and keeps you guessing untill the very end. The most unexpected and heart breaking twists come completely out of the blue, however this leads to a more dramatic and thrilling story. I found the story very captivating as it doesn’t focus completely on the war, death and destruction you would expect from an action/mecha(like Neon Genesis Evangelion, bodies blowing up every few minutes, sheesh) anime but it also gave us glimpses into the characters school life and friends which let you build a strong link with the characters. The story was somewhat slow paces at times becuase of the constant suspense but it is well worth the wait,This anime had one of the most memorable endings ever. 
  
Characters(10/10) 
The characters are truly the highlight of the whole anime. Not only does it feature compelling protagonists/antagonists throughout the , the roles are constantly in motion. The use of “anti-heroes” and “anti-villians” as well as more traditional character models such as the the motherly figure, the girl with unrequited love towards the main character etc make for very interesting interactions and alliances. Each character is unique in their own way and each have problems that they must face.Many people end up liking the minor characters more than the major ones.Through the characters the show confronts viewers with conflicting views of morality, different individuals will see the characters in different lights. Where one person sees an anti-hero another will see an anti-villian or antagonist etc. 
 
Animation(9/10) 
The animation throughout the series is superb. The fight scenes are extremely well animated allowing the viewer to play the same scene over and over again without getting bored of it( i know i did).The large scale wars are well animated without the background losing its color or the masses of soldiers turning into mush and appearing like a swamp of mud. 
 
Overall(10/10) 
Overall the series was amazing. I ended up staying up overnight waiting for the last episode to be released. This show will never cease to amaze you, whether it be through unexpected plot twists, massive large scale wars, an unexpecting fanservice shot or  touching relationships.  This anime will meet your demand and surpass it.

    Story. Main character Kimura Yui lost a family. The psychiatrist helps to cope with the pulled hard stress. On one of sessions the girl felt badly and lay down on a couch. Having woken up, she finds the psychiatrist in a blood on the floor.  
""- Whether do you know something about Yunko Kanzaka's murder?""  
""- Yes.""  
There is caption. At once there is a question: ""Already end?""  
 
Ideal epigraph to this roller is poem of Vladimir Vishnevsky ""Oh, as the sofa came to an end suddenly"". Probably, founders didn't have enough money for continuation shooting. It is a pity. The quite good series could turn out. However the first and unique episode simply breaks. It is not open ending. It is not ending at all. I do not recommend to look: only frustration. (Itself looked casually: I thought that there will be an integral short thriller). Fiasco...  
 
A monotonous anime based on exclusively human's feelings. Plus a little detective. The picture is subject, but incomplete and compressed. Characters are interesting. But aren't opened almost. The viewer sees any sincere throwings, but gradually starts to miss, for can't understand, from where they appeared in a plot … Posing is pleased. It is quite realistic. And it is qualitative. OST’s … Partly faceless, however, as well as an anime. But all create the same mood.  
 
P.S. Whether did really money suffice? Maybe founders wanted to leave mysteriousness that we reflected and presented how to be developed events further. I think that. I will not be surprised, if the guy, who wrote the letter to the main character, appears the murderer. It is only guesses and as everything will occur further to solve only to you.

    This is a review that i wrote after i watched the first season of this show remastered , in other words Space Battleship Yamato 2199 . Also beware , there are spoilers ahead , and some big ones i might add .  
By the way , i will compare this with the Yamato 20199 , so if you didn’t watch that i suggest that you won’t read this .  
First of all i have to say this season had some plot holes that could've been avoided , spoilers incoming .  
In the end Teresa could've just teleported Kodai near Zorder and killed him there and she wouldn't had to die . Yamamoto could've ejected not salute Kodai like a idiot and Saito would've lived if he didn't go Guns Blazing ...  
For some reason i find anime this old influenced by cartoons of the same age , you will see what i am talking about if you will watch Yamato 2199 and after that this as a second season , and no , i am not talking about the animation , sound , voice acting and so on , from my point of view this lacked the anime feeling that nowadays shows have .  
The biggest dissapointment was character interactions , in the first season ( Yamato 2199 ) when Yuki ‘ died ‘ our protagonist was devastated in the least , he acted , if you can say that , like a normal anime character , but when Shima ‘ died ‘ in the second season he was trembling for a few seconds after that he had nothing , but why would he , it was just his best friend that just died , he was a minor character like that Arakome guy ( Rookie ) after all .  
And that’s not all it felt like there was some kind of distance between characters , they acted like robots or maybe that’s what I was seeing .  
If we get passed this point there is still something that bothered me , the plot holes that I talked about earlier . There were a lot of chances to avoid stupid battles and stupid deaths , but for some reason the author wanted some of the crew to die just to get things more emotional , I for one don’t find that a good idea , some of you might think that I watched to much Bleach where characters refuse to die , but meaningless death is retarded , even in anime .  
Ok , now that I said what I didn’t liked about this , let me say what I liked about this show .  
Lets start with the story , a generic one , like the first season they take Yamato and go to a lady that summoned them for a reason that will be told after a few episodes . Personally I don’t dislike this kind of story , even if it was used a hundred times at least , but saving the Earth from bad aliens never gets old .  
Animation is good if you think 30 years in the past , as some other reviewer said the animation was top notch then by those standards and I have to agree with him/her .  
The OST is just perfect for this anime , better said it wouldn’t fit for any other show except this . The opening song is something very catchy and I found myself listening to it almost every eps , talk about weird , the music when Yamato was in danger or when it was almost certain of victory fit like a glove . But what could’ve they done better was the sound of the engines of the ships and those lasers , damn that sounded like someone scratched the blackboard .  
 
I think I said enough of the characters , if I will add some more someone might trace my IP and wait for me at nearest corner with a bat .  
 
For some closure I will say that this could’ve been done better , but still I found this rather enjoyable .  
My only wish is that this season and the third one will get a remaster version .  
Thanks for reading .

    Claymore is an anime that can be really interesting and boring to watch.  There were episodes which were among the best that I have seen but the start and the end of the anime disappointed me.  Due to those episodes in the middle I actually hoped that the ending would be as good.  I was disappointed 
 
Characters are monotonic, that you probably either like that character or hate him/her.  There are a few characters that I absolutely love, but there are also these whom I would almost skip the scene when they appear.  Just remember that, when you are getting pissed of by the little boy Raki just like I did when I watched it, watch on; since he won't be in most of the episodes anyway. 
 
The artwork and sound aren't especially impressive either, but they are not that bad that it affects the overall enjoyment of the anime. 
 
Despite all these, I thought Claymore is definitely worth watching just because those few episodes.  You will know it when they come.

seen via Japanese raw 
 
art:crisp 
 
this was a trailer mind you. There was some Japanese writing but i think it was only in mention of character's name and function. Otherwise it said nothing else.  
 
Trailer ran for about 4 minutes and 30 or so seconds not 6 minutes. The remainder of the six minutes would be the credits. 
 
Shame to hear it got canceled as of 2012... i wonder if still is. I will update this if i find out it is not canceled. 
 
the show or movie would have been a battle of opportunists in saving the world from evil. 
 
Sincerely your reviewer,

    The ending of this anime struck me RIGHT through the heart! My emotions were everywhere and I was unable to process it for a while. 
The story was wonderful, great characters, and one real ending. This anime has moved me in many ways. It covers well on subjects like war, revolution, sacrifice, and peace. I normally don't enjoy revolution/war animes, but this one did well in my book. The ending was the main thing about Code Geass that really took its rating up a level. Whenever I think back to it, I am still just simply shocked! Very influencing on me for an anime.

    To be honest I don’t really like the pure comedy anime that all that much. One of the reasons why I don’t these types of anime because the comedy/gags can get really repetitive to the point where the comedy/gags become predictable, unfunny and at worse annoying. Konosuba 2 and School Rumble, in my opinion, are the worst examples for this because not only they kept the same jokes to the point where they overstayed them welcome but those shows ended up being wasted potential. You can the viewer laugh all they want but if you don’t have any substance to back it up as well timing your comedy/gags then you have screw up your comedy series director. As much I don’t like the pure comedy anime there were a few pure comedy anime that I actually liked such Excel Saga, Baka and Test and Osomatsu San. 
 
Now I am here talking about Mahoujin Guru Guru (2017). 
 
Now I was originally going to avoid this show altogether because since I didn’t like Konosuba 2 all that much and I thought this show would just be a repeat of that. However, some of my friends have recommended this show to me because they said its really great comedy/parody series that is really funny and it doesn't have problems of other comedy series such as Konosuba and School Rumble. 
 
Since my friends have told me great things about I decided to take the bait and watched it and after watching al 24 episodes of Mahoujin Guruguru (2017) all I can say is its one of the better comedy animes out that I have seen but at the same time it does have some problems which I will explain throughout this review 
 
Now with that hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to of Mahoujin Guruguru (2017) and with that out of the way let’s get started. 
 
Story. 
 
The story follows a young boy named Nike who gets sent along to a quest against his own will to defeat the newly revived devil king. He soon meets a magical old woman where he gets entrusted with caring for a young girl called Kukuri, who still doesn’t know how to control her mysterious Guru Guru magic. From there Niki and Kukuri head off for an adventure together. 
 
The story of Mahoujin Guruguru (2017) is not that special in fact it's pretty generic. However, while the story is generic it makes up its comedy, gags, and RPG (Role-Playing Game) references which for the most part this show does a good job. 
 
The best part of Mahoujin Guruguru is the RPG references that this show does. From the word, items are “acquired” instead of Nike has picked up a bunch of items. 
As for the comedy itself its pretty good for the most part. 
Now unlike most comedy anime ever made this show, for the most part, knows to times its jokes and gags. Because of the jokes and gags being almost well timed the show can be really hilarious at times.  
 
However, the show has some problems. 
For starters, the show is not always consistent with its pacing as the show sometimes the show goes way too fast for its own good and it makes the average viewer feel confused about what is happening on screen. I also find that ironic because the original series had the slow pacing and not to mention filler. 
Another problem that I had with the show that shares with other comedy animes such as School Rumble and Konosuba 2 is some of the gags/comedy start to get repetitive over time such as the Kita Kita dance gag which got annoying as the series went on and that gag alone made me heavily dislike certain charter in this show which I will get in a bit. 
Overall the story while being generic was still pretty funny thanks to its comedy, gags and RPG references.  
 
7/10 
 
Characters. 
 
When it comes to the characters I thought they were pretty great overall minus a certain character which I will mention in a bit 
First, we have Nike. I liked him as a character. Yes, he’s just your typical male fantasy protagonist but what makes him so enjoyable to watch is he’s gags, reaction to situations and character interactions with other characters especially with Kukuri.  
 
Next, we have Kukuri. 
 
She is easily the best character mainly due to her character development which was great. Yes, Nike gets a bit of character development as well but Kukuri character development was more impactful. 
 
As for the rest of the characters, they were range cool to annoying. 
 
Udberg Eldol is easily the most annoying in this anime. His gags were funny for the first couple of times but after the 6th time, it got really annoying to point where I cringe every time he appeared on screen doing that god-damn Kita-Kita dance. Not only has the Kita Kita decent that it general became unfunny and repetitive had hell. The only redeeming thing about this character is some of his references that he does throughout the show. Other than that this character is an annoying piece of shit who actually ruined my enjoyment of the show quite a lot and every time I hear the Kita Kita I just close my ears. Because of that he’s easily one of my least favourite characters from 2017 period. 
 
Juju and Raid are funny characters overall that being a lot of good comedy. I just wish Raid and especially Juji had more screen time in this show over a certain character that I really dislike throughout the series. 
 
Overall besides from Eldol the characters were funny, likable and enjoyable to watch. 
 
7.5/10 
 
Visuals. 
 
Visually this show looks good but at the same time, a bit disappointing. 
 
The backgrounds were great and they have that nice flat retro color feel to it that perfectly represents the classic JRPG games from the 90s but in an HD format. 
I also loved the 8-bit style of the show as it reminds of the fantasy games from the NES library like the legend of Zelda to Final Fantasy. 
As for animation is pretty basic and it fits well with the show however I wish they did more with it. 
 
Now the things that I don’t like about the visuals. 
 
For starters, if you compare to other anime from Production I.G such as Haikyuu, Guilty Crown and even to Ghost in the Shell stand-alone complex from 2002 you find out the animation is kind limited especially for Production I.G standards which are known for they great productions values. Am not trying to say the animation of Guru Guru was bad or anything. In fact, I would it has unique animation, however, I still have to say it’s one of Production I.G weaker animes in terms of production values. 
 
Another problem that I had with the art-style constancy. I have no issues with the many art styles of the show as it fits with the show, however, the show like to change its art style way too often. 
 
Overall the visuals were good for what they were but it could a lot better if it was more consistent. 
 
6.5/10 
 
Sound 
 
The soundtrack is good for what it is but ultimately is not that memorable. 
However, the sound effects in this anime are amazing and well executed. It feels like you’re playing a real JRPG game with these sound effects. 
The openings are pretty great overall. 
Opening 1 Trip Trip is a great catchy theme that fits well with the adventure tone perfectly. 
Opening 2 Ryuusei Dance is good but I prefer opening 1 more.  
As for the ending themes. Both of them were fine but they were not that memorable. 
 
The voice acting is great overall as each of the seiyuu did a great job with the roles that they were giving. My favorite performance of the show was Konomi Kohara as Kukuri. She did a wonderful job voicing this character. 
8/10 
Final Thoughts. 
 
Mahoujin Guruguru (2017) is a pretty good series overall. 
 
The show has a lot of good things in it but at the same time, it has its fair share of problems. The pacing of the show could have been a lot better, the comedy/gags were not always great as some of them got repetitive as the series went on, Some of the characters became annoying over-time and while the art style itself was unique as it represents an RPG world it actual animation was pretty lacking for a production I.G as well its art style constancy where the show likes to change its art-style way too much. Fortunately, the good outweighs the bad as the show had pretty good comedy overall that when it was done right it made me laugh quite a lot as well having great JRPG references and great characters like Nike, Kukuri, and Juju.  
 
If you a fan of pure comedy anime then you will definitely like this show. 
 
Final Score 7/10

    Why do yuri fans have to suffer so much? 
 
When I was stumbling upon this year's spring anime, Tachibanakan Triangle immediaetly caught my interest. Wait a minute, is this yuri? And a comedy without any nerve-racking drama *cough cough Citrus*? And potentially ecchi? Omygosh omygosh omygosh! Can such a perfect thing even exist? 
 
Turns out, it doesn't. Well, I thought for a long time that it does, but two weeks prior to it's start a shocking message about the length of this anime arrived; Duration: 3 min. ; Internet was once again able to break my heart... Seriously? A freaking short? *sigh* 
 
Anywayy, now let's talk about what this anime really is. A disappointment. Tachibanakan Triangle is an adaptation of a 20+ chapter long manga of the same name. I have read through the manga prior to watching the anime and it's important to say that, unlike the anime, the manga is actually good at what it does. It's light-themed, has laughs and fanservice moments. Sure, it's just a stupid yuri comedy, but if you come into it expecting that, it can't really disappoint. The characters are also very likeable as a whole, even if they follow the very basic patter of personalities diversity.  
 
Now, does the anime has any of the things I mentioned? No, it doesn't. In a fact, the anime completely abandons everything the manga tries to accomplish. The episodes are so filled up with random content that before you're able to appreciate any single scene or moment the anime already moves on, throwing more poorly animated and non-sense making things at you. The whole fanservice part is also very disappointing. The shots are pretty much the exact same as in the manga, but they lack spirit. They lack the effort. Which is the problem of the whole anime, to be completely honest. 
 
The manga plays with it's characters and with it's environment. Sure, the things happening in there are mostly random too, but they have their purpose. You can tell that the things characters experience are somehow related. Not in the anime however. The scene selection itself makes no sense and even when it decides to adapt somehow important things, their sole purpose is nowhere to be seen. Also, relationship growth is an imporant aspect of the manga, as there is a clear love-triangle between some of the girls later on. But once again, the anime moves so quickly and unlogically that you propably wouldn't even know which of the characters are truly in love if you haven't know beforehand. The characters themselves have absolutely no chemistry, you can't even tell apart their personalities. Their sole reason for being in the show is because they just have to be there. You wouldn't want to believe that these girls are friends, students or even real people. 
 
Be ready for the real deal, the production values. Like I already mentioned, the pace with which the anime goes at is incredibly fast, even for a short. Sure, they tried to adapt as much as they could, but I would rather see a bit less content filled anime which would make a bit more sense than what Tachibanakan decided to go with. It's hard to follow, forgettable and all episodes blend together into a huge pile of randomness. 
 
The animation is, kind of a big deal. I actually wonder how small of a budget this anime had. If you decide to make a short instead of full series because of small ammount of funds, I would expect that the animation quality of the short would atleast be respectable. Sadly, it isn't. The arstyle itself seems very messy, and it's kinda funny how little is actually animated. Most of the scenes are either static images or 'chibi' animations.   
 
 
--- 
 
You know what's funny about Tachibanakan Triangle? Even though it's short, poorly animated and the yuri fanservice is also disappointing, I can't bring myself to hate it. It's a show I created a bond to and I seriously wanted it to succeed. Sadly, it didn't. And even though I'm in no position to tell you what to watch and what to not, if the only thing you're looking for is yuri fanservice, go check out Sakura Trick instead. And if you're interested in Tachibanakan Triangle in particular, go read the manga. In both cases, you're gonna end up with a much better experience than this empty shell of a real anime.

Annoying SNN rookie reporter Hibiki Kanzaki discovers Ishtar, an &quot;Emulator&quot; that enhances the Marduk's combat abilities through singing, while reporting on the first contact with the Marduk. Hibiki smuggles her to Earth to teach her the values of life and culture. Together with ace Valkyrie pilot Silvie Gena, can they find a way to save Earth from total destruction at the hands of the Marduk leader Ingues? 
 
The plot was rather simplistic and had the potential to go Orwellian - state vs. individual, censorship and the public's need ... no right to know things! Sadly this was never taken to any kind of satisfying conclusion so while it had great promise it never lived up to its potential. The part that was done well was Ishtar's discovery of earth culture. Overall, the story was Mediocre at best. 
 
Character 
 
Hibiki started off as a totally unsympathetic character, very papparazi-like, but he learned some life lessons from an older war correspondent who changes his view of life. Ishtar is a very well conceived character and because of that the end sequence for her made me cry. 
 
They are surrounded by a largely forgettable cast of support charcters, chief of which are Silvie and Max, the resident ace pilots with little to no character development. In fact the zentradi who is always protecting Ishtar was more memorable than either of them .. 
 
Art/Animation 
 
Dated animation but very little frame reuse. The animation as a whole was decent at the best, besides Hibiki and Ishtar (who has faboulous outfits), the rest are kind of stereotyped and not very exciting to look at. Fight scenes were rendered &quot;ok&quot; not great either. 
 
Sound 
 
Sound was the highlight of this anime. Great songs, some taken from other series (Macross 7 etc.) and some new songs. This was the best thing about this anime. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
Overall this is only something you'd watch for the music and the sake of saying you watched it to finish the series. I might go look for the music CD but I doubt I'd buy the series DVD.

    First of all, let me start off by saying that this was the first anime that I have ever watched. Though at the time, I didn't know it was an anime. I think I was 5 years old when this movie came on T.V. but I wasn't home to watch it and my mom seeing a commercial earlier for an Aladdin movie on T.V., she decided to record it. Unfortunately, the VHS that she had, only had room for about 30 minutes of taping. Even though I had only watched 30 minutes of this movie, the images would always stay in my mind. 
 
The movie was made in 1982 so keep in my mind the technology they had for graphics and sound. The movie stayed very true to the original Aladdin story in my opinion (much more so than the Disney version). Even the Japanese opening song was in an Arabic tune to make things seem more authentic. The Scenery and drawings in the movie were very well done for its time. The details in everything from the shining fruit in the underground gave to the Arabic city streets lined with pots and clothes and food stalls...everything was very well drawn. The effect the animation style had on me even as a child was something amazing because I remember being scared for Aladdin when the sorcerer trapped him in the cave. Overall, for its time, the animation was amazing.  
 
Now for the sound, I only watched the dub, however even with the dub, I felt like the characters were well portrayed and that their voices did not deter from enjoying the stories. The music was nothing special but it stayed true to the Arabic theme. The only thing I found annoying was maybe Princess Badral's voice and the fact that they recycled the ""busy street people"" sounds in the background, but again, this doesn't deter from enjoying the story.  
 
For those that have only watched the Disney version, be prepared...because this version seems more authentic (less modernized). This is not a bad thing though because the story is different and interesting and I felt like I was watching something new even though I knew the story of Aladdin. For example, Aladdin gets married to Badral even though he's only a kid. If you can keep an open mind, these concepts will intrigue you more than turn you away from the movie. The pacing of the story changes half way through the film, I don't know if it's because I'm biased because I only watched the second half recently, but I felt as though the first half took its time to let the watchers to introduce Aladdin and his life. The second half where he meets Badral, everything seems to go faster...even how fast him and Badral fall in love and get married and how soon the Sorcerer manages to steal Aladdin's lamp. The fast pacing near the end kind of threw me off but I still enjoyed the story none the less.  
 
This movie really was the epitome of my childhood and for those that don't mind a little outdated animation, I think it's definitely a good watch.

    Well, this show certainly is...something. I wish I knew where to start with this series. After finishing it, my mind is a bit of a mess. 
 
Actually, you know what? That perfectly describes what this show is. A mess. A big, jumbled, only-semi-coherent mess. And you know what? It's sad. It's sad that a show with so much ambition, so much production value, and so much potential, can funnel the resources together to chart a flight course, build itself a rocket ship, strap itself in, and shoot itself as far as it can, only to peter out and lose its momentum (and, by consequence, me) just as it barely extends beyond the moon in its attempt to reach the stars. 
 
To say that this show's flaw is in its foundation wouldn't be entirely true. I believe that the foundation of any story lies in its premise. And not only do I not find any real flaws in the premise of this show, but I found it quite intriguing as well. And that's saying something coming from a guy who is not unfamiliar with stories of people who are stuck living the same day over and over again (I'm sure most of you can guess which well-known western film starring Bill Murray I'm thinking about right now). Despite the premise seeming somewhat recycled, I was ready to give this show a try, fully intent on enjoying it. So no, it is not the premise that lost me. 
 
Sitting on top of the foundation of this show is the story. And yes, after a certain point, the story started to dwindle in quality, but that is not the pressing issue with this series. No, the thing about this show where I really started to become annoyed, and therefore, uninterested, was the characters. Let's start with the protagonist. 
 
Subaru is an ordinary otaku loser who is inexplicably transported to a medieval fantasy realm and soon discovers that he has the ability to reset time when he dies. Using this newfound power, he resolves to prevent the horrible atrocities that he witnesses as he becomes more and more involved in this fantasy world's political games. At first, I didn't pay it much heed, but after thinking about it, I started to really admire Subaru's selflessness in his desire to put his life on the line solely for the people he has just barely met. In the first ""arc"" of this show, he is cautious and distrusting of many of the people he has just met (except Emilia, I'll get to her later), but eventually befriends them and vows to protect them from a strange threat that will kill them if he doesn't do something about it. This ""arc"" takes place over the course of the first few episodes and, frankly, I was completely on board. He participates in plenty more journeys of self-sacrifice throughout the course of the show, and ultimately treats them like they're no big deal as long as he succeeded in protecting his friends. 
 
The problem with Subaru starts to emerge with the second ""arc"" of the story. By this point, all this selflessness we see in him suddenly stops making sense. And as the show goes on, it only gets worse. With the first ""arc"", I understood it well and could thoroughly enjoy it because the show had the decency to give me at least ONE BLEEDING SECOND to appreciate why Subaru cared so much about these people. But from then on, I guess the writers just said ""Alright, we've established that our protag is capable of befriending people! No more wasting time with petty relationship-building for us!"" With the introduction of a new arc comes new characters, and this show expects us to just believe that all these new characters magically befriended Subaru, and thus, our hapless tracksuit-wearing hero is willing to cut his balls off for them (okay, he doesn't actually do that, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did). Honestly, that's this show's most gaping flaw right there. It selfishly expects me to care about all these characters without giving me the chance to get to know them. Everyone else is just the icing on the cake. 
 
I want to stay true to this show's tradition of not giving Subaru's ""love interest"" (I'm serious about those quotation marks) Emilia a whole lot of screen time, so I'm just going to say that Subaru's obsessive devotion to this chick is nothing short of cringeworthy. Aside from being a mildly pretty face as well as being willing to give him a place to stay for a couple days, Emilia gives the protagonist no real reason to care about her and thus, no reason whatsoever for me to care about her. But the difference here between Emilia and the other characters whom Subaru routinely gets himself disemboweled for is that I don't think there's a whole lot to their relationship that we don't see on screen. And what we do see is....meh. At least with the other characters like Rem and Ram, I'm able to at least PRETEND that something meaningful happened between Subaru and them because 90% of the time that he spent with them, we don't get to see. That's not the case with Subaru and Emilia. Nearly every interaction that we can assume took place between the two of them, happens right in front of us. And it doesn't extend very far beyond basic introductions and small talk. And yet somehow, Subaru manages to fall in love with her. Amazing. 
 
With so much of this show riding off of the nonexistent relationships between to protag and these other characters like Emilia and Rem, I'm surprised that I'm not giving this show a lower score. But the fact of the matter is, no matter how much this series lost me with its confusing protagonist, eye-rolling drama, and irritatingly bland ""love interest"", I can't in good conscience give a score below six to any show that had me caring JUST BARELY ENOUGH to make me want to continue watching. Like I said, the story is not bad. If you're one of those people who is easily moved by the pointless slaughter of characters that the series doesn't give you much reason to care about (I must admit that I kind of envy you if you are), then I think you'll find this show engaging and enjoyable. 
 
It's a shame that I can't be one of those people.

    It's not a bad little show.  I mean, it does have some good points to it, such as the decent artwork and some likeable characters (even if the ""cute shy girl who is the granddaughter of the mecha's creator and the only one who can pilot it"" is way to cliched), and a decent story set-up.     
   
But, on the flip side, there also really isn't any ""there"" there.  It's just one of many in a sea of mecha anime that flooded the marketplace during this time, all with very slightly different back stories or slightly different designs.  And Legaciam is no different - nothing special to really stand out.   
   
Just a short little story that sort of ends after this one episode, and that's it.  Legaciam came.  And Legaciam went.  And in the end, unless you're a mecha freak, best left in the eighties.

    The story starts with a rather plain looking college girl and her romantic adventures with this dashingly attractive young man. It turns out that he’s a wolf-man, but the lady doesn’t care because golly, he really is quite a catch. Besides, wolves are cool, so it could be worse. He could be an uncool animal like a sea-cucumber man. They have kids together but raising them in the big city is a bit of a pain, especially since they keep turning into wolves when they get annoyed. So they move to the countryside and start a new life there. It is one half about the trials and wonders of raising children and providing them with the environment in which they can thrive, and one half about gosh darn isn’t the countryside and nature wonderful. Its closest comparison would be Totoro, what with the family with two kids moving to the countryside away from the smelly city. 
 
The mother in Wolf Children is really quite an extraordinary character in how determined and admirable her attitude towards life is. The trials she goes through in order to raise her children the best she can is the main focus of the movie. The kids do lead a fairly happy-go-lucky life under her, ditching off school to wander around the forest, but it comes under the main theme of providing an environment in which your children can pursue any goal they wish. It all has a very strong focus on family values, and it comes across as all being rather hopeful and inspiring. In fact, maybe a bit too much… 
 
Here is where I reveal that I am a horrible human being, because I found the aggressively maudlin tone overbearing. Particularly the opening 15-20 minutes of the movie with the relationship between the mother and the wolf dude. It laid on the sap way too thick. It reminds of those movies that are made entirely to win Oscars, with their overly sentimental tone. The way these movies try to draw emotion become almost robotic in their predictable nature. Wolf Children doesn’t have a single twist that isn’t even remotely surprising. That obviously doesn’t preclude it from being good, but it is a nice way of demonstrating how much it plays to this same factory-churned heart-tugging attempts. 
 
There are parts to this movie I do genuinely like. The interaction between the two kids when they’re still young is charming as hell, particularly in how they formed opposite personalities in the way siblings do. The older child runs around and lot and is very charismatic, while the younger brother is quiet and withdrawn. It’s rather like myself and my younger sister, where videos of us would be her sitting around reading books patiently while I run around in the background screaming about Sonic the Hedgehog. Wolf Children perfectly captured that boundless energy and curiosity that children have. 
 
But the other parts that I might otherwise have liked are fed through this maudlin machine and flip around to be too sentimental. The struggle the mother has to go through to get a garden working is really overdone, or more specifically the part where it says how wonderful the people of the countryside are. Not a message I’m opposed to by any means, but it comes off as way too overblown emotionally. The final part in the movie with what the younger brother eventually decides suffers from the same problem. I won’t spoil, but this is a really huge part of the movie that marks a massive emotional decision on his part and his mother’s, which they still somehow manage to overstate. I would like the movie to let me experience these emotions myself, not to have it smashing me over the head with a saucepan yelling “ISN’T THIS TRAGIC? LOOK AT HOW EMOTIONAL THIS IS! CRY DAMNIT!” 
 
I wouldn’t say it’s a bad movie. There was never a stage when I wanted to leave the cinema and visit a trendy coffee shop instead. But the way the movie smashed repeatedly about how emotional everything was paradoxically left me feeling even more indifferent towards the film.

    Warning : Do not view if you don't want to see SPOILERS! 
 
Art : It's pretty old so compared to the art in anime's nowadays it's a little sloppy but it's pretty good if you consider when it came out. 
 
Sound : The sound is very good. 
 
Character : Characters are great, as we have all our favorite story line characters Kumi, Ippo, Coach Kamogawa, and all of Ippo's gym mates. Ippo and Kumi get some major character development and their relationship becomes much better. 
 
Overall I really like the story as it revolves around Ippo having to overcome a punch that can break through your guard, and the guy Ippo is fighting is loved by all of Kumi san's (Ippo's unofficial girlfriend) fellow workers and Ippo and Kumi have an argument that might very well have ended their relationship completely over whom Kumi would be cheering for. However in the end Kumi reveals to Ippo that she had cheered for him and their relationship that could very well have ended ends up improving... And not just a little.

    And so the story continues…. 
 
The series started exactly where the season one ended. Just like I said before, it’s as if the two seasons was really one series cut in the middle so they created a second season. This series was way even better from the previous one, story wise, because the main plot was more focused and so the story was more on the serious flow. Lag’s search for Gauche continued and halfway the series it turned into a quest to find the truth. Lag struggled to take Gauche back almost like that famous Ninja who foolishly and unconditionally searched for his friend (If you know who I am referring to). Some of the important revelations about the main plot were explored like the truth about the “Day of Flicker”, the artificial sun, government’s experiments, the goal of Reverse organization, and even about Niche’s identity. The most important though was about Lag. The truth about Lag and his mother was strongly hinted in this series. Though every revelation created another mystery. 
 
The ever crybaby Lag Seeing and ever cute Niche returned in this series. The revelation of some information about the government shook the beliefs of some characters. It even changed the resolve of Gauche that led him to turn his back from his past life as a Tegami Bachi though it was strongly influenced by his memories being gone. Even though Gauche never returned to his former self and created calmer and heartless persona, it was so he can protect and inspire other people as Noir. He maybe a different Gauche but his compassion for others was still there. Perhaps he realized the truth about the government for the better. Lag decided to just cherish the Gauche that inspired him and accepted the other persona of Gauche which was Noir. More than anything else, Lag’s naivety and innocence was put to test in this series. With the realization that Gauche’s heart can never be returned and the horrifying truth about the government that he works for, Lag’s resolves and beliefs was shaken.  He was to choose whether to stay believing in his resolve or to succumb to the dark and cruel side of the world like the people from Reverse. I just love stories with the transformation of people after learning that life is not that great as other people say. After realizing the truth about the world people either matures from it or succumbs from the hatred of the cruelty and unfairness of the world. It just fascinating to see when people mature from their innocent selves. 
 
The animation was still as captivating as before perhaps a little bit greater. The cool costumes of the characters and captivating visuals of every episode was also amazingly done. The sounds and seiyu’s voice was as perfect too. 
 
Watch this series as the story continues from the season one. Get more of Lag’s crybaby moment and Niche’s cuteness. You will love the series even more with this second season.

    Before I started watching this movie I had high hopes for it because of the art  and the character designs but also the fact that this takes place in Russia during the WW2. As a fan of history and especially modern that attracted me a lot. This movie could have turned out way better if it was a series (wich would let us know the characters better) and if it wasn't that supernatural (I only liked the fact that Nadia can see the future ). You might get to know some things about the main character Nadia but what about her friends? The story should focus more on the characters background and the historical events in my opinion. I was kind of disappointed after watching this movie because it had a lot of potential. What I dysliked was basically the supernatural part since I'm not really a fan of those things unless the story has a message to pass to the audience. Well atleast the colors and the animation are fine but a good anime doesn't always mean good art, what makes an anime good is the plot , the characters and anything else it has to offer wether it's positive messages , funny moments or action. If you don't agree with me that's completely  respected and I would like to hear the opposite opinion too.

    “I have a big gun, and I took it from my lord”. 
 
The fictional town of Roanapur in Southeast Asia was the most corrupt and dangerous existing city. Gangsters, mercenaries, violence, prostitution, drug addiction and murder. It is in this city that is the headquarters of the Lagoon Company, a group of mercenaries who undertake any work as maritime smuggling, escort, assaults, and even hunting for rewards. It is composed by Benny, a technology expert, Dutch as the leader and the Beautiful and deadly killer Revy. 
After being kidnapped and discarded by his company on redemption,  a guy named Rokuro felt so angry with everything and with your lifestyle that he solves joining the Lagoon Company. He became know as Rock. 
 
The development of the anime will be in accompany Rock, Revy and the Lagoon performing their jobs and engaging with many dangers in their missions in Roanapur. 
 
If you're too young, you will be prompted to: There is a side of the new anime age that very few have the courage to show, and those who grew up watching Yu Yu Hakusho will remember with nostalgia: Violence debauched. 
 
In an attempt to show a more naked, violent and gray reality, those animes made use of violence and debauchery to tell us the following: the world is violent, unjust and rotten. So, if you do not like it, fuck you. That's Black Lagoon. 
 
Without focusing too much showing the past of the characters to compose them, Black Lagoon bet more on the actions and dilemmas of each one present to develop them using Rock and Revy as counterpart. He, an ordinary guy, with nothing more, is now engaging with people living in this world without feelings for a long time, as Revy. It's under Rock's point of view that the anime shows how much the world is violent, and it does not kill you, it's you who dies. 
 
Do not wait here cuddly things, beautiful feelings or 'good overcome evil'. You must be prepared for all those cliches of the genre: the adrenaline, the destruction, the action and exaggeration. Revy and various characters doing everything so well with poses, smoking cigarettes or drinking and destroying everything with that aura of Chuck Norris (the main characters are never shot, but always kill 200 guys with a gun having 7 bullets in the clip). 
 
But despite the cliches, we are presented with a great opening/ending and with a diversity of amazing characters that makes the show worthy. A round of applause for special women in the plot, as the former russian military Balalaika, the assassin with daggers Shenhua, the nun shooter Eda and the Venezuelan maid Roberta. 
 
Violent, mocking, exaggerated, Black Lagoon presents us with those scenes of explicit action without requiring a lot like those old classics that will never comeback. With an amazing range of great characters, this anime shows that the world is rotten, and that's the world we live in.

    I know what you're thinking... you're angry that I gave your favorite movie a score that wasn't a 10 but before you go to my profile and write an angry comment saying I have a shit taste in anime please read what I have to say then feel free to say whatever you want. This is my first review on MAL so please bare with me for a few minutes as im not really that good at making things seem professional. 
 
When I was going into Kimi No Na Wa I was thinking that it was going to be the second coming of christ, (considering it portrayed that way) but oh god I was wrong. And instead of coming out of the movie instead of being emotionally touched, I was actually infuriated that I had wasted my time with this piece of garbage. 
 
Story - 2/10 
All I can really say is that they tried.. they tried really hard to make this a compelling, touching, & emotional story, but the way its presented makes nearly everything about this movie fall flat on its face. The story Kimi No Na Wa is nowhere near unique, but that isn't really the problem that I have with it. It's more of how they poorly executed the story actually was, let alone the entire movie. The story of Kimi No Na Wa is a gender bender romance between 2 horrifically bland characters on how they switch bodies and how they learn to communicate with each other and live the life of someone of the opposite gender. When the story is supposed to be a roller coaster of emotions when it actually feels completely rushed and almost nothing about it even seems remotely real. They could have done a lot more and I see what they were trying to do with this film, but this further supports the theory that Makoto Shinkai completely lacks the ability to write anything compelling. 
 
Art - 8/10 
I mean good animation is always a plus, to be completely honest they had really good production. Almost everything about the art style was pretty in some way but that doesn't really change the fact that good animation cant save a poorly executed story. To be completely honest the animation is the only reason to watch this movie and nothing else. But if you're only really looking for something that has an amazing animation you'll probably be better if you found something else as it isn't hard to find things that are prettier than this. 
 
Sound - 6/10 
Not much to really say here as it doesn't really sound all that amazing or all that bad either. Nothing really stood out to me as that amazing for the sound production. The music was pretty cool I guess? But honestly, I can't really remember anything that was absolutely groundbreaking. 
 
Characters - 2/10  
Oh boy, and the Characters where do I even start. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is even remotely interesting or unique about the characters in Kimi No Na Wa. I get that its a movie and they don't have as much time to develop the characters than in a normal length anime but Jesus Christ like at least try and make them unique. Both of the main characters are your average cookie cutter male and female anime protagonists. There is NOTHING about either of these characters that stand out. They don't have funny or even interesting personalities. It honestly amazes me how anyone can relate or even feel anything towards these characters. 
 
My Personal Enjoyment - 1/10 
I've never actually been angry after finishing something of any sort. If its bad then I kinda just tend to brush it off, forget about it and move on, but as I said earlier I was actually infuriated because of this sorry excuse an emotional romance film. I tried really hard to like this movie trust me I tried really fucking hard to enjoy it, but I honestly just couldn't do it. Almost everything about this movie seemed poorly written and rushed which led to an awful experience. And if I wasn't watching it with a friend I honestly would have stopped halfway through. And honestly, I should have instead of wasting my time when I could have been doing something else.  
 
Overall - 2/10 
I don't really know what else to say the real only redeeming factor was that the animation was good and literally nothing else stood out. it was a poorly written, bland story with even more bland characters. It honestly baffles me on how anyone can think this is anywhere near a masterpiece. I wouldn't even recommend this to anyone who wants even a little bit of good storytelling. Maybe to people that want something pretty so they can turn off their brain and be distracted for 2 hours. 
 
I only really made this review mainly because I have a really strong opinion on this movie as a whole and thought I had to get it out there. Like I said earlier though this is my first review so it would be nice if I could get some feedback on what I could improve on next time. Thank you for taking your time to read my review.

    One of the best anime I have ever seen, a masterpiece. 
 
WARNING, THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS! 
 
 
Story: 10 
 
No cliches or overused things from other animes. There are also no lame/boring transformations. It only has 1 arc, which is pretty unique cause it's not a seasonal anime.  This is also the very first anime that made me cry (For example, Hohenheim's death) and after finishing it, I felt empty, I didn't know what to do after that without this anime. 
 
Art: 10 
 
The art and animation is absolutely amazing! Good fighting animations, effects, backgrounds, and a lot more. So, it gets a 10. 
 
Sound: 10 
 
It doesn't really have the best soundtracks, but it definitely has some great ones. I remember back when they were preparing for the promised day and then the 4th opening sound started before ending the episode. That thing hyped me up. And this is also the first anime that made me watch all the openings without skipping them, in every single episode. 
 
Character: 10 
 
It has awesome characters. Ed doesn't really train like other main characters do, instead, we have Winry to make better automails for him and that's how he gets stronger. And this is one of the first animes that made me like a few characters in only the first 10-15 episodes. Mustang, Hawkeye, Father, Hohenheim, Ed, Al, Winry... So many great characters with awesome designs. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
Do I really have to even talk about this? I was able to watch up to 10 episodes/day of it... Which is pretty bad cause I finished it fast. 
 
Overall: 10/10 A masterpiece. 
 
 
P.S This is my first review, so I hope it's good.

There are some nice thing's about this, but those few nice things aren't really enough to make up for it's flaws. 
 
I'll keep this review quick, after all there are just two episodes, so no need to go into too much detail. 
 
1. Story: Actually this is the best about this series. The idea of using hypnosis to get the girl you like and your sister to perform sexual deeds for you, isn't really bad at all. Quite enjoyable in fact.  
 
2. Art: Not bad, but also very mediocre. Some scenes look good, some not so much. There are some moments where the anatomy just seems off. 
 
3. Sound: Nothing out of the ordinary. The soundtrack is pretty 'ok' as well as the voice acting. Again, nothing special, but not horrible. 
 
4. Characters: Well, they are not bad at all. I quite like, that the guy is not your typical anime protagonist, thin and slanky. While I myself could not identify with him I didn't 'dislike' him. As for the two females, they are both average looking and that makes them quite enjoyable. As it seems with everything in this series, there isn't anything particularily outstanding about these characters. The sister is tsundere, but we barely get to see that side of her. 
 
5. Enjoyment: The story and idea behind this got me thinking, my own imagination kicked in and I thought of the females around me, that I'd hypnotize if given the chance. That made me enjoy this little series a lot more than the series itself. 
 
All in all this isn't a bad one, but it sure as hell is only average.

    Superpower Robot Pictionary 
That is what we got. This is not Aquarion (besides the intro/pre episode) its not robots bashing it out against demigods or godlike robots but a TV game show of pictionary were 2-3 characters flipp kanji symbols back and forth. Yes its a kanji gets superpowers and fuck the world up show, I believe it's to promote this obsolete outdated symbol script. But back to the show, the art and music is ok not bad nor good it works for most parts ( it would get a better score if you removed the ""word monsters"" and robo parts because the are a mess at best). Characters are well bland I've seen them a gazzillion times before and many times better too.  
This just makes me sad because I liked both Aquarion series even for all their stupidity they are good shows I enjoy this however falls flat on its face. The enemies are STUPID, comon Kanji with superpowers after a anabola shot? The weed the writers were smoking man must be some great shit.  
 
If you are looking for a show based on word play, watch ep 6 of NGNL 5 mins of that beats 5 episodes of this hands down.

    Its a shame that this was never dubbed ,seeing as im a dub only man I had my doubts{sub and me are like oil and water}.But man was I pleasantly surprised.three completly independent stories incorporated into one anime that turns out to be very enjoyable.the first movie magnetic rose is about a bunch of space garbage collectors who recieved a distress signal from an unknown ship,and the story that developes shows the fine line between infatuation and love and how if the two are not properly decern  it can be cause great harm.thats what I like about this anime although its entertaining each movie has its own moral and theme that its trying to convey. 
 
The second movie stink bomb my favourite is about a scientist that accidentaly takes a  pill that has awful concequences.and goes to shows how government drive for dominance can go  wrong.the third connon foder where an entire country is at war goes to show the stupidity of conflicts.Iv always been at the opinion that drawing animation is far superior to CG,memories is an anime that support that notion,the animation style changes greatly with  each movie with magnetic rose the first movie having the best animation iv ever seen  in its detail and colour texture. This is simply as must watch,it will leave you with great memories.

    So, a very different idea from. One of the very few character design as well. Before watching, I thought it was going to be a very serious series but I never imagined the protagonist to be like this. I liked this anime because of Saitama. His personality is different from all other protagonist. I have been watching anime for last 4 yeas but I haven't found any anime like this. And also the best boss battle ever I have seen. The line "" I'me a hero just for fun"" is also very funny because who wants to be a hero just for ""fun"". I also think the story was told nicely. They didn't hurried the anime.But, the story was too predictable. 
I could easily predict what was going to happen. This is one point i didn't like about anime.The art was also nice. It was fitting with the story. 
At the end, the story was outstanding. It was one memorable story. I enjoyed the story very much. The sound was also good. Overall, this was one hell of nice story. A very rare story.

    A long time ago, I had the idea to write a novel with every otaku trope in it, figuring I could capture the entire otaku market spectrum. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (Haganai) beat me to it. Goth loli, fujoshi, tsundere, forgotten childhood friends, natural-blonde-haired male lead ... it's all there in one jumbled mess. 
 
What really got me was the number of face-palm, cringe-worthy moments in this show. After all, Haganai is about awkward kids trying to make friends. If you think watching someone with Asperger's try to hit on chicks would be hilarious, go for it. For me, there were quite a few times when I felt like just hitting stop and leaving to do laundry or clean the house. 
 
The character interactions are just reused repeatedly throughout the series and they mostly just interact with the male lead, so you get the feeling that some characters are just there to provide fan service. Haganai copies tropes extensively but not to the point of parody, so it feels like a cheap shot compared to Ore no Imouto (which I enjoyed). 
 
Haganai was animated by the same studio that did Ore no Imouto, so the production was well done. There were some endearing moments and a decent yet entirely predictable ending, so it wasn't a total bust. All in all, it's a short series that has some good parts buried underneath the stereotypes and fan service, and while it's certainly not something I would recommend to most, it might be right for you.

    Just a pretty quick review;  I enjoyed EoE. The quality of the movie was amazing, the fighting was awesome to the point that it horrifies you (in a good way), the ending felt bittersweet. I'm glad that it ended the way it ended, especially with it leaving an empty feeling.

    Alright, so I'm one of those LN readers, but I'll try to keep that aspect out of the review since there are a lot of non LN readers watching this show. But due to being a LN reader, I probably have a more in-depth understanding of the anime... anyway, let's start! 
 
Story: 7/10 
It's a decent story. MC gets kicked of the team/ retired from the company he was in. Goes and transfers in a new account. Rebuilds a new character in-game, gathers up a new team, astonishes a bunch of people and rise back to the top. Something I liked about the anime was that it was a MMORPG gaming show without the whole ""stuck-in-the-world"" aspect, making it refreshing. Moreover, it has cool action scenes and finds a nice balance between Real life and Gaming. 
 
Art: 8/10 
Pretty slick animation, not just for a chinese anime, but for anime in general. The lighting kind of reminds me of Fate/Zero. A few frames were re-used in the first 5 episodes but it gets better later on. I take in-game repeated frames as the people using the same skills. The character design looks a bit weird- they look younger than I expected and some are not quite as distinct designs as others. The CGI background people are also a problem. Overall though, the art is very nice. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
The music is alright. Nothing too impressive, not terrible either. 
I applaud the VA for doing a good job voice acting. Most of them sound pretty natural. Compared to other Chinese anime, this show has excellent voice acting! Also, I was told that the characters don't sound very emotional. I think they usually sound like normal Chinese people. The show doesn't tend to exaggerate voices like many Japanese shows do, so maybe people are just accustomed to JP over exaggerating voices? The Chinese language was not a problem for me and I was told that many viewers got used to it soon enough.  
 
Characters: 8/10 
Characters are both the strong and weak points of the show. On one end, the villains are portrayed as rather one dimensional in the anime. On the other end, I love the characterization of Ye Xiu and other veteran pro players as well as new players on his team. The MC is a troll and a God-tier player. OP. So OP. If you want a weak MC this is not for you. He is intelligent, strategic, and he's not a stupid teenage boy. His interactions with other gamers are the best and super shameless and he bargains with them to gain the materials needed to level up his umbrella weapon. The females of the show are alright. I find the manager a bit thick and annoying but Su Mucheng (blond girl) is nice and so is the stubborn Tang Rou (short hair). Many have their eyes set on Huang Shao Tian, a super talkative but skilled trashtalker, and Steam Bun Invasion, an oblivious trashtalker who's very fun. Both would be annoying in real life but fans love them. Also, Wang Jie xi, wizard pro, showed up in the latest episode and he's quite good too. Important characters have distinct and lovable personalities that balances out the blandness of the company leaders and other villains. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
I really enjoyed the anime despite how much it cut out from the novel. It's at episode 7 but it has the content of chapter 120+ in the novel. Otherwise it's awesome to see the fights animated and adding to the awesome characters is the bits of humors that are pretty funny, mostly from Ye Xiu's shamelessness. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
Despite my personal enjoyment, I'm rating it 8/10 because there are many holes that came from the anime showing but not telling enough to the viewers. Cutting so much novel material also made it a problem. However, the animation is top notch and the characters are great! The series has gotten more enjoyable as it goes on and I hope you'll give it a chance!

    It's a hot spring episode with lots of loli goodness. If you're watching season 2 of Fate/Kaleid, then it's obvious what you're here for.  
 
The art is astounding, and I would say it is the best that I have ever seen. Everything from the characters to the backgrounds have really made an impact . The characters look sharper while the backgrounds look like masterpieces of art. A definite 10/10 and a must watch for any Fate/Kaleid fan.  
 
As for the fanservice, well... disappointment and any synonyms cannot be applied to this episode. 
 
And last of all let me just say... DAT WATER

    I am a HUGE overzealous fan of the Hyperdimension Neptunia games, and have even garnered myself a bit of a reptutation on DeviantART by creating ""Custom Canvas Textures for use within the second and third games in the console series. (mk-2 & Victory) 
 
I LOVE this anime, i think they did a great job mixing the plots of the games together to create a comprehensive story line for an anime that i believe is probably only ever going to have this one season.  The art is beautiful and vibrant, and the character designs are as close to the game as possible without Tsunako doing the animation alone. The sound quality is great and it's very funny and entertaining. 
 
As for the drawbacks, there are only 2 that really stand out to me. This is NOT a series you can just pick up just because....because the characters personalities and the humor don't make a lot of sense without playing the games. 
 
The second Drawback is the English dub....at least for me, as a fan of the games. Because, They replaced 4 different characters actresses, and they chose to do an English dub for a song, which is one of my pet peeves when it comes to anime.  the fact that that song also happens to be  the song for the opening sequence of one of the games, makes it even more annoying to me.  
 
And lastly, the first thing i thought when i watched the English dub of the anime was ""wow, i just noticed that the more Purple Heart talks, the less cool she sounds."" Because in the games, she doesn't talk all that much, and when she does, she's usually doling out either a good passive-aggressive insult, or passing on a few words of friendship and wisdom. So hearing her talk so much in the anime took some getting used to, but i understand why she talks more, it would be boring if The main character who by all standards, in her human form, is a regular chatty Cathy, were to stop talking when she transformed into her Goddess form. 
 
Altogether, i give it a 9/10 for fans of the game, and a 8 out of 10 for others.

A boy who want to become a great hero. The story is about fighting monsters and gaining experiences. A little bit of harem is involved.

I like the creative look of the characters. I do not have much knowledge to judge it so I gave it ten. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
It's fun. That's it. I can't explain much. If you like girls, watch this. If you want to see a boy that gain fast fighting skill and make other people interest in, watch this. 
 
Overall: 8 
Yes, a good to watch anime. You will not feel boring I'm sure because the main character has a girl as his goal. He didn't initially has her so you will be excited when he is meeting with her. 
 
Sorry for grammar.

    Definitely a comedy anime~ 
Story 7/10 
There are no solid story line whatsoever accept catching the goat, but it is really funny 
Art 9/10 
The art is nice as I like how they switch in between chibi and anime mode, when things get serious then funny, they change really really fast lol 
Sound 8/10 
The osts are not much of a big deal, the op is so-so and the ending song is.... a little weird 
Character 7/10 
There isn't any much character development, and the side chars are just there, not much background etc. But all of them are lovable, and you don't really dislike any of them. their enemies, don valentino are quite stupid though 
Enjoyment 8/10  
A few laughs definitely, it is an anime that will make you laugh and forgot that it's just an animation. But some might think that their gags were too forced and boring, but I think it's awesome \m/ 
 
Overall 8/10 
A very nice anime if you want lots of laughter, but if you do not like comedy that happens every minute in the anime... then well you might not enjoy it, but give it a try! At least until ep 2/3~

    Overview: 
 
The following is my review and analysis of Jormungand 1 and 2. The following contains SPOILERS!!! 
 
 
Black Lagoon abandoned the cliche of heroic nice guy protagonists and gave viewers a team of   highly morally dubious protagonists who get in epic gun fights and pull jobs for the Mafia. What if you took it one step further and made an anime where you the viewer are flat out asked to root for the bad guy? This is that anime! The main character is a completely ruthless arms dealer that is like a combination of Nick Cage's character in Lord of War with The Major from Hellsing. She is a perpetually grinning, maniacal sociopath who wishes to ultimately rule the world and will destroy anyone and everyone between her and her goal. However, I HIGHLY suspect that Jormungand doesn't actually want the viewer to root for her. Actually I am almost certain that Jormugand is a satire in which the main character Koko Hekmatyar represents the United States and its foreign policy from a Japanese perspective. If you don't believe me, read the next paragraph. The show gives a LOT of evidence to support this! 
 
Firstly, Hekmatyar was born in international waters and doesn't belong to any nation, but her father is an American and CEO of one of America's largest companies. This giant American company violates every international law and is secretly the world's largest arms dealer. This is a reference to the fact that the United States is the world's largest weapons exporter. Secondly, the name Hekmatyar for our main character was taken from real life terrorist Galbuddin Hekmatyar, who was heavily backed by the United States to fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan...despite the fact that he was a brutal war criminal who was far worse than the Soviets . He later betrayed the US and became a leading member of Al-Qaeda, which he still is to this day. Thirdly, the sidekick of our MC Koko Hekmatyar is an Arab child soldier named Jonah Al-Mar. Neither Mar or Al-Mar are actual Arab names. Al-Mar is the name of a knife company that makes the combat knives for the United States Army. 4th, the bodyguard and leader of Hekmatyar's elite special forces is a Finnish mercenary. The US special forces were founded by a Finnish mercenary named Lauri Allan Törni (Larry Thorn)...who was an ex-SS war criminal. The US let him out of jail early in order to teach American soldiers how to fight as ruthless and badass as the Waffen SS. 5th, in the first episode, Hekmatyar kills a bunch of Russians in order to become the sole arms dealer to what she calls a ""cluster of backwater countries in Eastern Europe"". This is a reference to how after defeating Russia in the Cold War, the US expanded NATO to control all of Eastern Europe and is now in fact the sole weapons dealer to all the countries of Eastern Europe except Belarus and Ukraine(yet). 6th, Hekmatyar's plan to take over the world involves a series of weapons satellites that will shoot down all planes in the world that are not under her control. This will give her absolute air power advantage and global domination. This is a reference to SDI, a US military project in the 1980s to build weapons satellites that would shoot down any incoming missiles and allow the US to nuke any opponent without having to worry about counter-attack. This would have given the US total control of the world, although the project was actually propaganda to scare the Soviets and was never technologically feasible, at least not in the 1980s. Lastly, Hekmatyar tells Al-Mar that her plan will shoot down all passenger planes currently flying, but 600,000 to 700,000 people is a small price to pay for the end of war under her total global domination. The number of casualties she estimated is in fact the exact same number of Japanese civilians killed by the US air force in WW2, which Japan feels America very coldly excused by saying it was necessary to end the war (and in Japan's view rule the world). These are just a few of the many examples. If you were paying attention and know something about history and politics, this is hard not to notice. Of course...it could just all be coincidence and this is just a shitty anime. 
 
This series has LOTS of gun and weapons porn with all the tanks, helicopters, and gun models presented quite accurately. I wish I could say the same about the character models. Why the hell do the Arabs have white hair and red eyes? I know the Ishvalen's were supposed to represent Arabs, but this is our planet and not some alternate dimension! Just make them look like Arabs! Also, Hekmatyar is supposed to be an ethnic Pashtun (largest ethnic group in Afghanistan), but doesn't look remotely Pashtun! If you can make your M16s and your Hi-24 helicopters look accurate, why not your Arabs and Pashtuns? WTF?! 
 
The series gives us a highly unconventional protagonist, LOTS of action, lots of accurate weapon models for military geeks, and unless it was the world's largest coincidence, a lot of brutal satire. Obviously I can't know the writer's intentions, so the satire element is speculative and whether or not the author's intention takes away from potential value as a satire is an entirely different lengthy discussion. This at first looks like a pretty mediocre anime, but if you look at it the right way, it makes for a pretty interesting show overall.

    Puella Magi Madoka Magica, or Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, is one of the greatest anime series i have as yet encountered. The plot is simply amazing, the soundtrack is mesmerising, the characters so easy to relate to that it is just phenominal.  
 
But that's not all, because this series takes everything you ever thought you knew about the magical girl genre and gives it to you, then turns your coach into a rotten pumpkin. 
 
The theme of this series is desires, dreams and wishes. Not only how we think we want something, but also how far we're willing to go for that wish, what we're willing to do for it, and the consequences behind being given what we want.  
 
Kyuubei, the wish-granter, is one of the most chilling characters i have ever met in the world of fantasy. And you end up empathising completely with Madoka and the other girls as their characters are so wonderfully developed within the series. The artwork is a mixture of cute-ish style and just plain wacked (you have to wonder how exactly some of these artists came up with them) and the soundtrack completes the mood so perfectlythat it all ultimately helps create an endearing and heartbreaking anime series. I've actually downloaded the entire soundtrack i thought it was so cool! 
 
The basic idea is simple; everyone has a desire within their hearts, be it for themselves or another. What this series does is turn the whole concept of this idea and the magical girl genre on its head like you're watching a dark fairytale that you didn't even realise was actually a nightmare until it was too late to turn back. 
 
I fullly recommend this to anybody, because this is not your average run of the mill magical girl series, and it reveals that behind the cutesy-fluff of the genre there is a whole other side to it that no one ever wanted to believe existed. If watching this series doesn't make you shed a tear or get even vaguely watery eyes, then i don't know what will. 
 
A truely enchanting and heartbreaking series that everyone should watch.

    “Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is Alchemy’s First Law of Equivalent Exchange” — Fullmetal Alchemist 
 
The quote above is certainly true when one thinks about the adaptation history of Fullmetal Alchemist. As compared to the 2003 version, Brotherhood is vastly different. The former did not follow the source material all the way through and pacing was off, whereas Brotherhood followed the source material from beginning to end, and that is why it’s so great.  
 
If one doesn’t at least know the prolouge story of FMA, then they have no business even reading any reviews. Quite simply, Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole is about two brothers who have committed the ultimate taboo of their world and they paid the price for it. So, they desperately try to get what they have lost, but along the way they uncover  truths that they were not ready for. 
 
The pacing of Brotherhood started off a bit iffy. In the first ten or so episodes, I felt it being a bit episodic. I mean, sure the first arc was about them uncovering the first batch of hard truths about what really was happening, but to me it felt just a little too episodic. Once it got around episode 11, I think that’s really when the show found its ground floor and it was uphill from there on. 
 
When everything was laid out for us and we were slowly fed what the over-reaching plot was, I couldn’t help but find myself so hooked to the screen episode after episode. Each one just pulled me in closer and closer, made me feel for these characters, made me want to know what was happening next, all the while not wanting to miss a single minute. 
 
Sometimes anime can either bring better art styles to an adaptation than the manga ever did or it could be worse. In Brotherhood’s case, I think it fell somewhere in the middle of all of that. Bones really did do a great job capturing the essence of the art style of Brotherhood while also throwing in their own specific style. From how it all flowed in animation to how all of the fights were so brilliantly created.  
 
I admit, I only watched the dub, so I can’t compare to how the English dub did as compared to the original subs, but I will say this: Funimation never fails to deliver on a great English dub. All around, the dub had a great cast. I don’t think no single voice actor or actress failed at what role they were given. A few standouts were: James Douglas(Major Miles), Vic Mignonga(Edward Elric), Kent Williams(Father), J. Michael Tatum(Scar), and Colleen Clickenbeard(Hawkeye).   
 
As for the sound effects and soundtrack, I think everything fit well. They timed the right moments with the right tracks. I think certain tracks definitely help set the mood for certain moments while not taking away from said moments. The Ops and Eps definitely were rightly selected. They were great Jrock tracks. I specifically loved the second OP and EP. 
 
Now to the characters. Such a large, yet wonderful cast of characters. Of course, thorugh it all, Ed and Al are the main focus through the first half. Then, that were we got to know the other characters at least in some bits. I really liked how each main character had their own arc and were given time to develop and grow in their own way. For example, I loved how Scar was able to grow in a way that made sense for him. I also liked how Greed kept on swaying from good to bad. I really felt for him. 
 
One standout character through this all was Roy. I loved how his constant arc of the show was a combination of two things: Becoming fuehrer of the country and avenging Hughes. Throughout the entire ordeal of everything going around him, those two main objectives kept his character the most interesting, I think, especially the dark path he took for a few episodes. That really brought the realism of this show full circle and how one decision could set us down the wrong path. 
 
In the end of it all, Fullmetal Alchemist finally gets the adaptation that everyone was waiting for. We finally got a proper one -- one that satisfied those  who read the manga all the way through. It might have a few bumps here and there, but Bones showed us -- and other studios I hope -- how to PROPERLY do an anime series that faithfully follows the source material.  
 
In any case, it’s a wonderful series that tugs so many heartstrings that we begin to feel like this show’s b-word.

    This is my review to the movie 'Boku no Hero Acamdemia: Futari no Hero'. The movie lasts around an hour and 30 minutes and is done by the animation studio Bones who have been doing the Boku no Hero Academia stuff so far so them making this movie isn't very surprising. 
 
Important Note: Since this movie is part of an existing anime series obviously you have to watch the TV stuff to know all the characters. But I doubt anyone would watch this movie without having watched the other series or who's reading the manga. 
 
Plot/Story: Hero Academia has since its first season been called a stereotypical story that's been done right, and I agree with that. To start of, this movie happens after season 2 and before season 3 of the TV anime. The plot of this movie is that All Might invites Midoriya to attend a hero gadget exhibition on the self-sufficient artificial island I-Island. While on the island a group of villains breaks into the security and barrikades a tower where a gala is being held. Of course Midoriya and others have to best up villains and save the day. A very typical story indeed. An interesting thing is that at the start of the movie we get to see All Might in his younger days. I would lie if I would tell you that this movie's plot is very good. In fact, I was able to detect and call out the plot twists of the movie from the moment they were set up. Which is during the first 20 minutes, mind you. But this is not important since this movie is a franchise movie and just fanserive for people who like MHA and to earn a lot of money for the following fourth season of MHA. I'm pretty sure that's the case. Now I don't know if this movie is Canon but from past experiences it is most certainly not. A franchise movie such as this one cannot live off of the main cast, it has to bring up great new movie-only characters and a great contained story. Does this movie have this? Ehh, not really. There is a very interesting device in this movie that Midoriya uses which is probably the most interesting part, although it is in the movie solely for the purpose of that Midoriya can do what he does and to make the movie more interesting. Apart from that the movie fails in creating a story that is well written and crafted, as well as out of the ordinary for once. The plot is quite predictable and does not have any holding in deep questions or anything like that. A very typical hero movie with MHA slapped onto it. 
 
Art: It's Studio Bones, okay. From that alone you can at least give this movie 8 points. Notable in art and animation is the final fight and that's it. They really kept the animation to a more grounded level, possibly in order to not waste too much money so that there is still some left for the next season and to further increase the amount of profit generated from the movie. 
 
Sound: Normally I would give them credit for using the very popular and good MHA hype soundtrack. Yoh know, that one track that's really good and everyone knows it. Of course it is used in this movie, and of course it's a good song. But you can't just rely on already used songs and tracks. What I like to see are new compositions, but frankly, I don't remember any BGMs standing out enough that I still remember them after 1 day. As for SFX, of course they are there but that's to be expected. Nothing noteworthy here.  
 
Charcaters: Because this is a franchise movie none of the TV main cast can get seriously injured, or anything of that sort. So the main cast can't be touched basically. So the other way is to have a good cast of new characters. First there is David Shield, a gadget developer and friend of All Might. He's what you expect from a friend of him. However, that's all there is to him: A good guy. And while I liked the plot arc of him in this movie, it left depth to be desired. Im sure the story board lead could've done better. Now to his daughter, Melissa Shield and the much better character. All around one of the only reasons this movie even has people like it. I'm not going into detail what her deal is because that would be spoiler. One thing that I can say is that our boy Midoriya had a great connection to her and Melissa was the best character in this movie, period. Sadly I cannot go into more detail but she's a good girl. Now to the villains. They are villains. That's pretty much it. As one dimensional as All for One. Throwaway characters to fill in spots for a villain. And again, that is suchh a shame. You can make great villains, why not do something like making David and the main villain know each other or the villain having a personal vendetta against Melissa or All Might. But no. Nothing. And because there is nothing I will also not remain here. 
 
Overall enjoyment and verdict: Did I enjoy this movie. Of course I did, it's MHA. The characters we know and love are the reason we watched this movie in the first place. But that does not cloud my eyes from the mediocracy that is the plot and the much to be desired new characters. Would I recommend this movie? For people who like MHA, yes. They will like it. It s pretty much fanservice for us who like MHA and a money-maker movie, nothing more. I give this movie a 7/10 for being a MHA title and having a great final battle with great animation. 
And that's it for me for this review. See you in the next review.

    Anime in one sentence: Everyone loves best friends, but not really! 
 
I was first recommended Toradora as something just cute and funny to get my mind off stuff and relax a little, so that's what I expected going in. Boy, was I wrong. Toradora, though it has its moments as the rom com its famed to be, actually resonated much deeper than what's on its cover. Not perfect, but still great, and definitely not what it seems. 
 
I'll mention the most defining factors in terms of grading: 
 
Story: 7/10 
Okay so this is where Toradora gets the most criticism from me, this one anime's weakness, it's predictability. First, I do understand that this genre isn't supposed to be very deep and intricate in terms of storyline but it really just takes out the enjoyment of watching something if I can literally guess exactly what happens in every episode with around 90-95% accuracy. A storyline becomes engaging when there's contrast, but Toradora kinda bummed me out there, giving me the feel of eating cafeteria food every day. What really gets me though is that the creators didn't even try when they were building the love triangle, by the end of ep1 it was 150%, no 900% obvious that Taiga was going to end up with Ryuuji. Like the whole omg ily ur best friend, no way me too thing was a good idea, but I would have appreciated less blandness. 
 
Sound: 10/10 <3 
Okay so I love, love, love op1. It was such a good song choice! At first I really didn't like it, but then as I continued to watch Toradora it really started to resonate with me and put me in the mood for the perky and energetic story Toradora is. All rainbows and sunshine there. I legit got kinda mad when op2 started, not because op2 is bad, but I just missed op1 so much. Endings are also really cute btw. 
 
Characters: 10/10  
This is where Toradora chose to deliver its kicker, the one thing that made Toradora stand out from the rest of the rom com pack. The character choices for Toradora were so well thought out and so further developed that I only have 3 words for them, I LOVE YOU. Throughout Toradora, the main characters go through so much emotionally that it just makes them all the more human and natural. They feel like I could walk through school and see them in my class or something. Their problems are something not only they face, but what many viewers, including me, deal with in our lives. And even better, there's an unique struggle for everybody. Toradora's characters are purely human and so relatable it's easily the best aspect of what they got right. Kudos to whoever made this XD 
 
And there you go: a rom com that's not as rom com-ey, but at the same time it's that extra spice that sets it apart. Also, any suggestions on how I can improve my writing is apprectiated, this is my first review.

    I loved the first season, but the majority of this one is just damn unbearable.  
 
You can disagree if you want, but the naivety and childishness of the two characters this ""second season"" (really just an unnecessary extension ruining the ending of the first season) ruins this anime for anyone who is actually mature, and lacks saintly patience to ignorance and naivety.  It is not cute, it is just fing annoying. 
 
How oblivious can two people be?  If you want to see that scene played out over, and over, and over, and over, and over again—you will LOVE this show!  I can only claim frustration for how soft they were to a girl so incredibly lacking any confidence.  The pain she felt was self-inflicted, and in conjunction with the naivety and annoying personality of the one she likes.  Maybe I am not debilitatingly introvert enough to get this, but even my fiancee was extremely shy, and incredibly hard to read, but being a man, I could at least let my feelings be known to her (and I could have in high school too!).  Kazehaya is just as bad as she is.  He can't just come out and say exactly what he thinks or wants to say, and gives these ridiculous statements that are simply too easy to misinterpret with two such naive and stupid main characters.  
 
This horrendous continuation of a great previous season really just served as a frustration-inducing waste of time.  There was so much potential squandered by pointless pandering to naive interactions that serve as nothing but filler, in what otherwise could have been summarized in simply a few OVA episodes or less.

    I was given this anime on a challenge, but I didnt think it would be this hard.  
 
Honestly, I liked the first episode, and then it was all downhill from there. 
The characters are poorly drawn, the story is rediculous, and the music does not fit, at all. At first I was going to review this episode by episode, I did so for the first two on my blog and then decided that it wasnt worth it. 
I am dropping this series about 1/4 into episdoe 6, right after her boyfriend tells her he slept with an old teacher. I dont want to watch this crap! It's upsetting and very far fetched. I mean she bites his arm because he wont let her go and she knew he was about to tell her....why would you want to watch this? 
 
I know this series does have its fans, and all respect to you, but Saikano is NOT for me.

    Why did I give this such a low score? To be honest, I'm getting really sick of this show, It's complete and utter garbage, I have had it with the dancing Hare Hare Yukai BS and non-stop talking about this series. I do not know why this show has been so popular, Really it is almost beyond me why a show like this is considered to be amazing, this is a comedy, but it isn't clever. I rarely laughed at all in this series, I  personally hate the main character with a passion, because she is not someone at all anyone should like, she is conniving, manipulative, scheming and in my opinion a complete airhead. I just I don't know what but seriously. I'm really tired of hearing this dance non-stop. It's aggravating.

    3 Seasons Combined Review 
 
At first i thought that i should watch all seasons and then write a combined review but after it was all done it was too much to write so instead i will do a (Pro/Con) list for the main elements of the show 
 
Story (8/10): 
 
Pros: 
- A good take on the Manga industry although i am sure that the real thing is more complicated than this it was good to have some sort of insight (Simplified as it was) 
- A good amount of Drama. The whole thing moved to high gear halfway through the second season and it was going up after that. The Romance idea was extremely far fetched but was still great to watch as the lack of day to day interaction actually made it better and less cliché imo 
- Good comedy 
 
Cons: 
- Some stuff get a little repetitive 
- It was kind of predictable, so there was no suspense factor for me. 
- Although the show was trying to show how ""cutthroat"" the manga industry is. It was extremely lenient with the MC at some points which took away from the realism enjoyment and added to it's predictability I mentioned 
 
Characters (7/10): 
 
Pros: 
- A huge cast with many great characters that ranged from completely nuts to simple and lovable 
- Kaya Miyoshi (Best Girl) :D 
- Kouji Yoshida (Simply loved his scenes) :D 
 
Cons: 
- Barely noticeable character main characters growth. The anime (in it's 3 seasons) supposedly spanned 10 years but even to it's last episodes i still felt like i was watching a high school drama 
- Everyone is so fuckin understanding o_O I mean what thae actual fuck. I realize that this a Shounen anime but things need to have a limit 
- Related to the point above, the show also lacked real assholes. one can have too much ""Friendly rivalry"" to last a lifetime in this show 
 
Art and Animation (8/10): 
 
Pros: 
- For an anime about Manga it offer some really great and different types of art 
- Environments and character design was good 
 
Cons: 
- It had some issues with size a depth perception 
 
Music & VA (7/10): 
 
Pros: 
- Catchy and upbeat OPs and EDs 
- Good voice acting 
 
Cons: 
- The soundtrack (during the actual anime) was repetitive. I believe it was the same during all three seasons 
 
Effectiveness (7/10): 
It was a good and entertaining show with a good amount of drama and comedy and sweet (Although super imaginary) romance but it was ""Too Shounen"" if this was an actual term 
if that aspect was toned down a bit i would have enjoyed a lot more 
 
Overall (7.4/10)

    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW** 
 
Like most sequels to beloved classics, expectations were quite high for Little Witch Academia 2. Considering that it was practically funded out-of-pocket by fans of the original short film via Kickstarter, anime fans really had every right to demand their money’s worth on this one. With the quality of the original and the hype that was created thereafter in mind, my inner cynicism led me to believe that LWA 2 was set up for failure. However, much to my delight, it can be said without hesitation that LWA 2 recaptures the magic of its predecessor and yet again contains more energy and charm in its little finger than the entirety of the modern anime comedy genre has in its whole body.  
 
Synopsis: Akko and her friends are tasked with organizing the annual “witch parade” for their town. As you might have guessed, not everything goes according to their plan. 
 
If ever there was a difficult characteristic to describe, it would be “charm”, and yet it is just that which makes LWA 2 such an entertaining and heartwarming film.  It captures that innocent, child-like sense of imagination and wonder that never fails to pry your lips upwards into a smile, and does so with the utmost perfection. Despite being an adult male, this movie made me giggle like a little girl from beginning to end. It’s not just heartwarming; it’s hilarious. The comedy is spot on and it hits every note that it needs to hit. Something about this anime brings back that Disney-esque feeling of seeing your wildest dreams brought to life by the power of animation; like seeing Fantasia for the first time. In an industry that many feel lacks the soul that it once had, LWA 2 has soul in spades. It reminded me why I like anime to begin with. 
 
Another masterful aspect of this film was the fact that its pacing was flawless. Every scene has a purpose, not a single one of them drags on for too long, and no scene is a boring one. The fast, energetic pace of LWA carries on into its sequel, and it fits the spirit of the show to a T. Despite being less than an hour long, this movie goes through a full, satisfying story arc, several character dynamics, and effectively expands upon its cast of colorful characters. There’s something beautiful about the simplicity of a well-executed children’s tale; the premise isn’t anything remarkably original, but it doesn’t have to be because the execution is all that matters. The characters don’t have remarkable amounts of depth, but they don’t need to; all that matters is that they have personality, they are entertaining, and they are likable. Disregarding a recap scene or two, which you could potentially argue were unnecessary, I wouldn’t change a thing about the story direction.  
 
One of the most important aspects of an anime in this style is the animation. When you write a quirky, upbeat script, it is absolutely imperative that your animation is equally quirky and upbeat, otherwise the show is doomed to fail. Needless to say, Studio Trigger totally nailed it, just as they did in the original. Comedic timing is something so nuanced that it comes down to fractions of seconds, and while many lighthearted anime (even the good ones) can sometimes find themselves a bit off on their timing or not executing jokes as well as they could have, LWA 2 has no such issue. It is no exaggeration to say this movie makes the most of each and every scene. The visuals are like eye candy, everything is polished and crisp, the character designs continue to be brilliant, and every movement is about as fluent as you’ll ever see. Simply put, it’s animation done right. 
 
To sum it all up, LWA 2 is a brilliantly executed anime movie that appeals to everyone. All ages, all genders, and all cultures won’t be able to resist cracking a smile at a movie that is simply so much fun. It’s a fast-paced, heartwarming adventure that will bring out your inner child, and I highly recommend that everyone take the time to watch it. If you ever need a pick-me-up, I can’t think of another anime that will cheer you up more than this one.

         This series is basically an exploration of work--how much time should be devoted to it, what kind of priority should be placed on it, what kind of approach should be taken to it, and how this all balances and affects the other aspects of a person's life, especially relationships.  The answer to these questions is shown to be different for different people, but it doesn't make any person better or worse than the other.  Everyone has to develop their own work philosophy.  There's not much of a connected story-line, except how the main characters' divergent work lives eventually affect their relationships.  Although several characters' viewpoints on this subject are touched upon, that is mainly because they contrast so greatly with that of the main character.  In the course of revealing these alternative lifestyles, the main character comes to both question and accept her own behavior in regard to work and relationships, but also to understand that others are different.  Ultimately the characters all grow, even if the outcome isn't always happy.  I found the reflections in this series to be helpful in refining my own view about my place in the work world. 
 
     I thought that the ultimate conclusion was rather inspiring despite some sad events, since the main characters have made some decisions about where they are happiest and therefore aren't constantly in the future  going to be devoting so much worry to the question of whether they are doing the right thing or not.  In short, they are happier people in the long run, having come to terms with their own personalities. 
 
     However, there was just one small frustration about the ending that I won't reveal because it's too much of a spoiler, but I would have liked it if they had developed this aspect just a little bit more. 
   
     Note:  It must be kept in mind that much of this was inspired by the current situation in the Japanese workplace, and for Japanese women in particular, although many aspects will be familiar to those from any culture and place.

    Tokyo gets mysteriously and very suddenly trashed. Monsters start coming out of cell phones and the main characters use their poke... er, um... demon summons to fight them. This, of course, attracts the attention of a shadowy government organization that is tracking just that sort of activity with some kind of sciency looking stuff. The men in black capture our heroes, take one of them aside, and explain to him that they are JP's:  an organization established with a great deal of exposition. This pretty much sets the stage for... a great deal more exposition. Did I mention that the demons look and sound ridiculous, or that nobody ever needs to charge a phone?  
 
Yet for all its idiocy, this show is actually not that painful to watch. Some readers are, no doubt, asking why I can say this about a show filled with clichés and bad running jokes. Here's a question in return:  why do people watch action movies? Many have an inherent silliness, yet they can be surprisingly immersing.  
 
I recommend abandoning this show if you haven't decided you like it by midway through the second episode. Actually, I only say to give it that much time because I have seen comments all over the place saying that the first episode isn't as good as the rest, and a few that say it gets worse as it goes along. I don't know where all of that came from. The quality seems pretty consistent throughout. In fact, that's why I finally got bored and looked for spoilers. Sure enough (according to what I was reading), it ends exactly the way I would expect it to, and seriously, a lousy ending is one of my pet peeves.

    Worst anime ever! Every episode is basically the same, I was gonna use pokemon but that's actually enjoyable, but they go to school at night to fight monsters, capture them, and that's it. Every episode I watched was just the same. ""But it gets better"" no it doesn't. Ever. There's barely any story to this damn anime. In my opinion you're better off reading the manga, it probably has more of a story. 
 
Sigh, because I should write a ""longer"" review. I picked this up around the 30 episode mark I believe. Started watching it up till I dropped it around 20 in hopes of a new character at least, they don't show up till later. By the time i got to episode 10 or so, I was already dreading this anime. I would rather cut my own ballsack off rather than watch this anime again. Ever.

Ok so I finished this anime maybe a week ago or so and didnt right a review. This is my first review so yeah. 
 
ACTUAL REVIEW 
 
This anime is pretty freaking awesome. The story is excellent with identity and reality concepts. If you like psychology or philosophy you will surely enjoy it. TBH, at first I found it boring, but I came to LUV it! Its a quiet type of anime, lonely feel, but very psychological. Just give it a try! I promise you will love it.

    One of the best anime out there. Truly a masterpiece.  
 
I didn't know that Afro Ken lived back in the stone age. Didn't he go extinct? It's really a good documentary. I can recommend it. 
 
10/10 Would watch again. 
 
Just for the song. 
 
I laughed at that one joke for 4 minutes. And I just couldn't stop. 
 
To think that I only discovered it by accident.  
 
But I am happy I did. 
 
I think I will make an afro on my head. Yeah! 
 
Afro Ken did nothing wrong. So why did they cut his hair? That's animal abuse. 
 
It's just such a hidden gem

    Mayoiga, the anime deemed ""Comedy of the season"". Personally, I find it quite appealing that someone would deem this ""masterpiece"" a comedy.  
 
Story is a 7/10 from me. People go in a village, stuff happens, silent hill vibes. 7/10 
 
Art 9/10, fluid art animation is quite seller. Much appreciated.  
 
Everything else *8/10) Characters were unique, concept was good. Got a Law exam tomorrow.  
 
Overall 7.5/10 or 8/10. 
 
Kept me interested, one of the most important pieces of modern day anime. 
 
Ok im going to go study now, bye.  
 
.. 
 
Hold on, if this anime was really that bad, then...why is it getting good reviews. 
 
People die if they are killed.

    What differentiates the real world from the virtual world? 
 
This short OVA discusses the concept of virtual world vs. real world. There is network and people can actually get ‘inside’ there networks and interact virtually. The story takes place when a young man is asked to join an organization called FLAK, which job is to dive in the network and attack the hackers who try to hack into FLAKs servers. This is only a portion of the story, the story is a lot more complex than this, there is revenge, friendships, and secrets waiting to be unraveled.  
 
 
The animators did a good job with the character designs and backgrounds. The buildings were beautifully drawn, the interiors were very detailed and the slums looked real. There is nothing too fancy about the art; in this is what made it beautiful. But that is all; it was beautiful, not extraordinary. The characters, on the other hand, were averagely drawn, there was nothing new in the designs, but they were (well some of them) beautifully drawn. There were some details that were better than other things. The mechs and fighting scenes were done in a very good way, the mechs were designed beautifully and the fights were smooth and tens at the same time.  
 
 
The music was one of the strong points of this OVA, from the quick beat of the fighting scenes, to the quite rhythm  on the hills, to the sad tone of the music box, all of those made a good combination of sounds. The opening theme was actually very good, it fit with the futuristic theme of the OVA. The ending theme was beautiful, it gives a sense of melancholy which also fits with this OVA’s theme. 
 
 
This OVA had various types of characters, we have the good people, the bad people, the victims, the culprits, the friends, the enemies, and so forth. Some characters were quite average, the types you would see in many series; but some were actually quite good, there were hidden pasts, tragedies that engulfed some of the characters. There was also a strong emotion that motivated the characters do some acts. Some were even ready to do some extreme things to reach their goals. The characters in this OVA were pretty good, there was some decent character development and some of them deserved the viewer’s sympathy. 
 
 
This OVA is a good watch, actually, it’s more than a good watch. It might take some time to get used to, but once the viewer gets used to it one can see that this OVA has much more that it offered. One should look beyond what was shown to the viewers, one should try to understand the message the developers were trying to tell to us. Even in a futuristic world, even when the the real world and the virtual world are slowly mingling with each other, there is value of ‘real’ relationships, of real friendships. 
Another point is, when people can freely dive into the network, if they were attacked by a virus or something their physical bodies in the real world would suffer as well. Are we humans ready for this? Are we willing to create a virtual world that is so real we might actually die in reality if we died virtually?

    The series started off great, but after the Large-Scale Invasion Arc, it went downhill.  The world(s) building was great and had potential, but after the Invasion arc they focused on some pool and beach episodes, and Ranking Wars.  During the Ranking Wars, there was explanations on strategies from each team before, during, and after the matches with use a small amount of focus on the actual fights.  Also, filler or not, after the Invasion arc, the Border agents fought off against a horde of enemies, with some top level enemies mixed in.  Most of the high ranking agents did well against the large scale invasion, but during a filler arc, some of the same rankers had problems with only one not so OP enemy. 
Not sure why Osamu was the MC, he would fit better as a side character.  I liked his courage, but he was weak and the only reason why he survives is because of others.  Yet, he wants to go behind enemy lines.  He only gets slightly stronger, and they want to make him out to be some kind of genius, but he is just an above average strategist.  Then there is the freaky big headed Chika, some of her decisions make me wonder what is the point of that big head of hers, especially during the filler arc.  The rest of the characters are pretty decent, Jin and Kuga should be the main characters of the show.

    This review will include Baka and Test Season 1,  Baka and Test Season 2, and Baka and Test OVA (Matsuri). 
 
There are minor spoilers in this review. 
 
This anime is not for everyone. The story is pretty random, jumping from one plot-line to another. It's pretty hard to grasp some decisions the main characters made (such as giving up the opportunities to exchange classroom utilities), and you will be confused by what the anime is trying to achieve. Therefore, if you are looking for some thought/feeling- provoking anime with great story-line, this anime is obviously not for you. Also, this anime is the mixture of all the weirdness in anime world, from cross-dressing to homosexuality to incest. If you greatly oppose to any of those, you will hate this anime.  
 
Now, with those out of the way, it's time to praise this hilarious and well-built anime.  
 
First of all, this anime will make you laugh every single episode. The comedy in this anime is so great that even I, who don't really enjoy comedy, laugh pretty hard throughout the series. Also, one of the major theme portrayed throughout the anime is friendship, and also the idea that being smart academically doesn't mean the best. It also takes strategies, bravery, hard-works, and team works to be the best. This anime also have slight romance, and a love triangle. The characters also contain all sorts of weirdness, from a tsundere to a violet and clinchy yandere, from a stalker to homosexuals, from a guy who looks like a girl, to a sister who does inappropriate stuff to her brother. These characters all contribute to the comedy. 
 
tl;dr- You will love this anime if you like school comedy with slight romance and a variety of weird characters.

    At first I'd like to say: Best Conan Film Yet!! 
 
I've seen all the Conan movies currently (which I could find) subbed (11), and this movie, &quot;The Phantom of Baker Street&quot; was the movie I enjoyed most. 
 
Let Detective Mouri drag Conan (Shinichi), Ran, Professor Agasa and the Detective Boys with him to another party where he was invited to, with lots of kids, celebrity's and known people from the anime. Don't forget the highly anticipated murder which will occur.... 
 
Then you get a good story for Conan to solve, but what's more? This isn't a regular party, this is a party for kids to test out the beta-cocoon, a game terminal formed like a cocoon, which takes on the five senses we humans have, then they let the people think they're somewhere else, we got several stage's, Paris Dakar Rally, Treasure Hunters and more, and of course a theme for a Conan movie, England, a 100 years ago, the time, where Sherlock Holmes lived. 
 
But, before the actual story, with Conan begins, we get an intro, of a very young protagonist in the computer world, he created one of the best A.I. systems in the world, but he couldn't take it anymore, his step-father pushed him to his limits, and he decided to let the program free, he let it escape via phone line, and then ended his live. 
 
Now, when Conan enters the game, Ran and the remaining Detective Boys find a way to get tickets for the cocoon beta test too, together with some snobs we meet in the beginning they visit the old england, while the other kids go to different stage's, but then an error occurs, the A.I. &quot;Noah's Ark&quot; has the game and pretty much the whole building under his control, if all 50 kids die in the games, fail they're objectives or run out of they're time limit (if they have one, like Paris Dakar), they'll vanish from the game world and are put to sleep, if really all 50 lose, they'll die,cause these kids are the future, but everyone is corrupt, so the A.I. wants to change their minds, not to follow in daddy's footstep. 
 
Pretty cool story huh? Well, there's another story in each game world, Conan and the gang have to solve the mystery of JTR (Jack The Ripper), and then capture him, sacrifice's are made, puzzle's are solved, death is around each corner. If they.. succeed, they will find the killer of the one who created this game.. 
 
So you get it, a cool story within a cool story, then about the art, the style's the same as in the series, yet better animated, and more things are realistic now, movements, carriage's and such. The sound, the ending is sweet and beautiful (mixed with the movie) and all the sfx's and such are amazing! 
 
The characters basically stay the same, we can yet see another horrified and afraid Kogorou (Det. Mouri), which I think is a good side of his, we can see what he will sacrifice to save his daughter (not so much in this movie, but there's a hint.), we can see Professor Agasa from a side we've not seen him before (not totally). The rest stay the same, new introduced characters are basic type's too, like the murderer, the victim(s), and the snobby, irritating, dumb rich snobs which are introduced. 
 
An anime movie where you can't take you're eye's from, when it's not humorous, it's intresting, when it's not intresting, it's exciting, when it's not exciting, it's beautiful. 
 
One of the best anime movie's I've seen.. yet. 
 
Absolutely brilliant!!!

Fantasies make our days better. Face it. Whether we are at work trying to pass the time or on the bus trying not stare. We all have them. Without them i fear the world would be in a more hectic place. For there wouldn't be that nice little outlet. Alas, for a luck sole a realistic scenario unfolds that turns a what would be fantasy to reality. But does it stay that? Does it turn around? Find out. While the ending wasn't comical i did enjoy it for it was romantic.

Characters are lovely. Environment is to die for. Sadly, realism doesn't occur. I understand there are some rare exceptions to many things but come on. If four or more people jumped from a three story height for example surely one of them is bound to get hurt in some matter. Even if it a scratch. While i can understand the decision not to include it the idea of not being realistic ruins the mood, at least for me. Yes, clean and tidy is nice and pretty compared to rough and messy but that is life. Nothing is perfect for we all love a little bit or so of chaos in our lives. As can be seen by the amount of drama shows being produced on television. Like the old and still true Young and the Restless.

    Is it possible for this show to live up to the hype its been given? So so very nearly. Nothing can be perfect. But this should be almost better than anyone could hope for. Certainly was for me.  
 
If you strip away the outer coating the story is nothing special really. It's just a nobody (surprise surprise, a kid) going from no one to someone on a journey that will be filled with epic moments &amp; the making of new friends, be them enemies once or not. Where have we heard this before? I wonder. 
So there isn't anything that makes the story special? Well yeah, I suppose there is. But it's not the story itself, but what this show fills the story with. I can't stand anime with crap stories, however the story isn't really important here when you have all these amazing characters &amp; events happening, as long as the story means they keep coming. It doesn't matter how bad it is.  
 
The art seems to often switch from style to style, sketchy, angular, cartoony, realistic (in an anime sense) &amp; ultimately I didn't think it worked all that well. It just often comes off cheap looking somehow. And the battles, they are often incredibly unclear, everything moves so fast (I'm not sure if this is on purpose or not) &amp; just becomes this sort of crazy blur. Or once again, loads of coloured lines &amp; balls of orange for explosions. It's like they took the same image &amp; changed one thing &amp; the background &amp; used it for the whole anime. I suppose the saving grace is the designs of everything. No matter how unclear, you can't deny that everything this anime does screams cool, while pointing it's finger up at the sky &amp; one leg placed on a raised object.  
 
Sound. As amazing powerful as it is at first, you soon find it quite annoying, that basically every male character shouts rather than talks. I mean the lines start to become less epic when once again they are shouting them at the top of their lungs to some kind of funky coloured background. The voice actor cast is however, a good one. Even if you keep expecting Viral to shout bankai. I especially loved Kamina's voice (Japanese) this warm, strong voice, which is recognisable straight away &amp; will fill you with warmth &amp; joy everytime you hear it. Wow that was cheesy. In terms of music, this has arguably the best soundtrack in an anime ever &amp; they use the music perfectly. Except maybe the 'Roh roh, fight da powah!&quot; stuff... 
 
The characters in this are simply perfect, whether it comes to personality or design. And I suppose it is hard for me to explain why with such a large cast without spoiling. But I want you to, if you haven't already, watch this anime &amp; find out for yourself. Even characters who initially annoy you at first will end up doing something which gives them a place in your heart. Trust me on this. If nothing else I have written so far.  
 
Enjoyment. It will vary. The first 3 episodes are pure pleasure, but then it's rather dire from episode 4 (it almost feels like filler) until at least episode 8 where it picks up again then it becomes a rather stretched out slog of samey battles &amp; a bit rubbish. Unless you're easily entertained. And attempting to avoid spoilers, to your dismay you will soon find out after that, that everything you watched was pointless.  Then it takes more time for some reason &amp; finally the end comes around &amp; the brilliance pierces the heavens with it's drill. And I think that is possibly the one fault with TTGL. You can't get enough, but yet, at the same time, there is to much. Things are dragged out way to much, random things happen, which merely tack something onto the certain scene to make it last longer. Not really twists, more like they hadn't enough materiel to make the series as long as planned but refused to admit it.  
 
So overall. I don't look back on this in any other way than joy. What an amazing thrill ride of pleasure this anime has been. I am thankful for all the times it made me cheer, smile, cry, laugh or simply scream at how cool it was. But it isn't without faults. There is a little to much man &amp; way to much ambition to call this perfect, or to truly live up to the hype. It is however, one of the best things you'll ever watch at this length.

    THIS ANIME MADE ME LAUGH, I was in hysterics through most of every episode. This was partly done by the amazing unique characters and the cliched mixing into one leading to some great comedic moments. Alone the characters could of made me laugh but this anime combined  some of the weirdest and wackiest characters I've ever seen, not to mention the protoganists curse which adds more random to the mix making the show completely unpredictable.  
 
Unfortunately the anime has its flaws its biggest one for me was the ending, in this case lack there of. The anime seems to end right when things are getting good, and many things are left unresolved and unanswered. Which is disappointing because even though the plot it self wasn't anything special the mix of characters and the protoganists unique curse made this mundane plot into something great and as I was watching each episode my expectations kept growing but ultimately they were not met. 
 
Overall this anime is great for anyone just looking for a something to laugh at and relax it has and interesting plot and a great set of characters.  
 
Overall rating is 7/10 I would love to give this anime a higher rating as the characters and enjoyment are at least 9/10 if not 10/10, however the lack of an ending and the amount of unanswered questions just made the anime feel incomplete.

    Overview: 
 
Hot take! Kaiba is overrated as fuck! In all seriousness, Kaiba is actually a pretty good anime. The animation is stunning and the character designs are wonderfully unique. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the series from a writing standpoint and I don't believe it's one Yuasa's best works. Honestly, I liked Lu Over the Wall more than I liked Kaiba. I liked Kick-Heart more than I liked Kaiba. Cat Soup? Yep, it's still better than Kaiba.  
 
The story of Kaiba is told in an almost maddeningly confusing manner, but it's actually pretty simple. People are now able to store their memories in little flash drives and switch from body to body. People can also erase bad memories and download happy memories that belonged to other people. The wealthy use this technology to keep switching bodies and live forever, while the poor sell their bodies for money. The poor are told that they will be stored on a flash drive and their families will one day be able to get them a robot body, but typically their memories are just erased and they're killed off. The poor live on shitty planets and the wealthy live on super ritzy planets that are inaccessible to everyone else.  
 
All of these are supposed to be mind blowing, incredible plot points, but everything in Kaiba is a well recycled Science Fiction trope. The story is basically just a shitty Metropolis, but doesn't say anything new about the evils of wealth inequality or social stratification. Hell, it says far less than Metropolis did 90 years ago! Evil rich guys switching bodies didn't start with Get Out. It was done in B-movies way back in the early 60s like ""Frankenstein Must be Destroyed!"" How about the part with downloading happy memories and deleting bad ones? That was done in Total Recall. Also known as Ah-nold und zee sree boobs! Back around 10 years ago there was a shitty action movie with Justin Timberlake called ""In Time"". In that movie, poor people have to sell years off their life to wealthy people, who accumulate time until they can live basically forever. It may have 30% on Rotten Tomatoes, but it was just as deep and profound as anything I personally found in fucking Kaiba.  
 
Maybe the problem is with me. Other people watched Kaiba and got something meaningful out of it. That's awesome! More power to those people. I've heard frequently that it's all about the importance of memories and how we should cherish all our memories including the bad ones. I mean...yeah. My grandmother has dementia. Of course I cherish my memories and fear losing them. I don't personally consider that a profound lesson, but that's just me.  
 
I've also read this series is a love letter to Osamu Tezuka. Seriously?! Of course I can't speak for Yuasa. Maybe he really said that in an interview. Personally , I have my doubts. Mr. Yuasa loves animation as a concept, but has never displayed a real love for ""anime"" as non-Japanese know it. I don't think there's an otaku bone in that man's body. There's a quote falsely attributed to Alan Moore that says ""I don't make comics. Those are garbage for children. I make graphic novels"". While Moore never said anything like this, I could absolutely picture Yuasa saying ""anime is trash. I make artsy cartoons!"" I'm supposed to believe that anime's greatest outlier, who spent his entire career being as un-anime as humanly possible decided to make a Tezuka tribute? I'm calling bullshit. 
 
The character designs are pretty awesome...mostly. Then there's this flying booger named Hyo-Hyo that never ceases to be obnoxious. Navi from Zelda would make up excuses not to hang out with Hyo-Hyo. Then we have this weird black caricature with fat, blue lips and a bulging tumor on his forehead. Oh and his name is Vanilla. God damn it Yuasa. What the fuck were you thinking? 
 
We all love Yuasa. However, I feel the man is much more comfortable as an artist than as a writer. His best works are Ping Pong, Tatami, and Night is Short, which were all adaptations. When Yuasa does the writing, we end up with stuff like Cat Soup. I was disappointed by Kaiba, but I'm glad other people love it. Now go and spread that love by fixing the fan wikia! As of the time of this review, the wikia is barren and has had zero effort put into it, as if nobody actually gives a shit about this series. The Wikipedia page is also a near stub and lacks basic episode summaries! There are 30,000 people just here on MAL who would say ""I LOVE Kaiba! I don't just include it in my favorites to look smart!"". One you guys please go fix this.

    This is my personal favorite entry into the yugioh franchise of the 3 that I have watched (Duel Monsters, GX, and 5Ds). This brings us a fairly different take on some duels in the form of riding duels while still keeping the heart of the yugioh franchise alive. 
 
Story (8/10): 
As with any yugioh series, the story follows a series of adventures our heroes must take on against antagonists to save the world. How do they do it? In a series of card games, of course. However, I feel like the in-depth plot development of these arcs were very well-done. The audience was given a chance to understand the viewpoints of both the antagonists and our protagonists. The overall theme of the show is something along the lines of 'the importance of bonds between friends'. The show demonstrated this theme several times through the character's actions as well as through monologues and speeches made. 
 
This show introduces the concept of dueling while riding a D Wheeler, basically a motorcycle. At first this idea seems silly, but the atmosphere of riding duels was very exciting. The characters and monsters were constantly in motion so there was a lot more going on than just finger pointing and monsters just chilling in front of our duelists. 
 
We are also introduced to a new summoning technique, synchro summoning, to bring out new synchro monsters. This is what is used to bring out most of the new powerful monster, but it did not feel overpowered and was not the absolute single summoning technique in the show either. It brought a new update to the game that only served to make the duels more interesting to watch. 
 
Art (7/10): 
The character designs were on-point with yugioh's crazy hairstyles while managing to keep the overall deign of characters balanced. The background design of the different settings were distinct and unique. My main issue is that the quality of animation was somewhat inconsistent. Some episodes, we had breathtaking animation with fluid motion with excellent layout designs. Other episodes, the characters would look out of proportion even during closeups. The 3D models used worked very well for the most part even though it was fairly obvious that the characters/monsters were not drawn. There were a few times where the 3D just didn't work very well. 
 
Sound (10/10): 
5Ds knew exactly where it was going with its sound. The openings were all fantastic in terms of both music and animation while keeping with the overall theme of 'bonds'. The battle music helped several duels go from exciting to on-the-edge-of-my-seat exciting. 
 
Characters (8/10): 
Yusei is our first and only yugioh protagonist to start out at the age of 18. Not only that, he has had to deal with issues such as poverty and being an orphan as a child which made him grow up to be a strong adult. The rest of the cast each get the spotlight for their character development when necessary and are fleshed out very well. There were a few characters who had a lot of potential for better development and a larger role in the story that were slowly left out of the plot. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10): 
I laughed, I cried, and there were whole scenes that I re-watched at least 5 times because of how amazing they were. It was great seeing an older cast and the slight darker tomes the show had.  
 
I would recommend this to anyone trying to get into the yugioh franchise and even if they weren't. You do not need to have watched any of the other yugioh shows to jump into this one, but be warned that the show does not hand-hold the audience through the rules of duel monsters that other yugioh shows might do.

    Godzilla: Kaijuu Wakusei or Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters is the 32nd film of the entire Godzilla franchise produced and distributed by a well-known company, Toho Company Ltd. notable for the distribution of Pokemon movies, Kimi no Nawa/Your Name and some Hollywood movies like Kong: Skull Island. Polygon Pictures (a CGI anime studio that brings you Knights of Sidonia) provides the movie's animation and IMO is the second movie after Blame! and is a part of Polygon Pictures Anime Universe. (Ahem) Let's get to the review, shall we? 
 
Voice Acting: 
In terms of voice acting, They brought all-star cast members and their voice acting skills are good.  
 
Music and Sound: 
Awesome music and sound especially during Godzilla fight scenes that bring you to the edge of your seat. However, in terms of sounds of gun shots and explosions, it doesn't looked like one that you've heard from most action anime and movies. 
 
Story: 
Sadly, the story has several inconsistencies and plot holes that make you feel confused and makes you say ""Why we don't fight Godzilla and take back what he took from us?"", ""Why we abandoned our home plant in the first place?"" and ""What's Godzilla's purpose in this world? Is he an ally or a threat to humanity?"" 
 
Overall, the movie is one of the worst Godzilla movies that I've ever seen despite it's good voice acting and suspenseful music. I hope the sequel will correct this blunder in the future.

    This anime gave me a feeling of joy that only few have given me. 
 
The plotline/setting of this story if far different then the actiony animes have.  There is no constant comedy and there no secert ultimate power. 
 
It gives the ultimate slice of life I have ever seen in an anime/manga.  The main character is just the average 30 year old with a good position in a job living alone.  But is willing to give it up for the happiness of a girl he is now caring for. 
 
The shear simplicity mellow feel of this anime is just right.  Even though it is not very comedic there are some parts that are so true about kids/ or reaction that it just that much funnier. 
 
I recommend this anime for everyone who wants to get away from typical all powerful characters/typical enemies/ harems, school life, magic animes.  cause this one is just about the facts of life.

    This is ""Must See"" anime for those with children, those without children and those thinking of children.  The anime brought a wonderful surface exploration of the transition of personal awareness from self of self to self as parent and self of primary family.  The anime examines an immediate ""immersion"" into one parent family life in a unique way.  Some real tough topics are approached in a heart-felt manner that can really leave you thinking or laughing or crying... or any combination.   
  The exploration of parenting as a sacrifice or an expansion of a person's life is conducted via very interesting ways.  We get to see glimpses into a few perspectives through the story line.  I must say that there are some common experiences in parenting that are found in the story line that just make ""Usagi Drop a dear ""gem"".   
  While exploring the title prior to watching it, I noticed it was generally classified as  Josei.  I have had little experience with this genre that I am aware.  I am happy to report I will be looking for more Josei titles. 
  Although my parenting years are long past, as my children are adults now, I still vividly recalled memories and feelings from those times while watching this warming series.  Enjoy!

    Let's be real, if you've made it this far into monogatari you're gonna be watching Zoku Owarimonogatari -- but just in case you're crazy enough not to I'm here to change your mind. 
 
Zoku Owarimonogatari acts as an amazing end-cap to an amazing arc (Koyomi Araragi’s), doing an even better job at wrapping it up then Owarimonogatari Season 2. It does all the things an epilogue-like show should do: it allows ample screen time for references from previous arcs within the story thus far, it brings back the majority of the major characters, and it continues the iconic traits that monogatari is known for. But this isn’t your average epilogue-like ending, it goes far beyond this category’s counterparts -- specifically by adapting an insanely unique premise really well (which is to be expected from Monogatari at this point), adding fresh character development, and adapting characters’ previous identities’ into unique new ones. In essence, it certainly doesn’t suffer from the problems that plenty of other epilogues do, such as repeating the same overused tropes over and over to achieve a sense of nostalgia. No, Zoku instead takes these tropes and flips them on their heads, which results in fresh character interactions that still supply the nostalgia you want from the show (I'm being intentionally vague here, you’ll understand more once you’ve watched it, which I hope you will). So if you were worried that it would just feel like another monogatari and wouldn’t stand out on its own, rest assured that its unique. 
 
Another point I would like to touch on would be the message. Monogatari is often known for its storytelling, character arcs, and thematic message; and although the message of Zoku is a bit less unique then some of Monogatari’s other messages, it is so well done and delivered you won’t even notice. However, this also allows the message to be relatable to a wider audience, which will certainly help most viewers empathize with the show more. I won’t directly say the message here, cause I want to remain as vague as possible to enhance the viewer’s experience, but it is extremely well delivered and comes out quite holistic. Also, not to worry, Zoku is about as complex and convoluted symbolically and plot wise as any another Monogatari. 
 
A final point I would like to touch on would be the animation and humor (I guess that’s two points). As is to be expected of Shaft, the animation is as good as ever. Not much more to say about it other than that its fantastic, and so is the humor. A general trend in Zoku is an increase in meta humor, which seems quite fitting for its identity since its supposed to function as a kind of epilogue to Araragi’s story. That’s not to say the normal monogatari humor doesn’t remain (it certainly is still present), but an interesting dose of meta humor is added that really seemed to enhance the show in my opinion. 
 
Alright, now that I’ve hopefully convinced you to watch it (although you probably were going to anyway), go enjoy you 2:30 anime binge. If you’re still unconvinced, just know you are missing out on one of the most satisfying, holistic, and complete endings ever. 
 
P.S. Enjoy a nice face wash after you've finished watching it ;)

    ""Ao No Exorcist Movie"" completely real deal... it's almost look like real life story.. about demon and human relation.. i love the hole story... i would wish to see one more movie and amazing story.. 
 
Usamaro is the cutest character that i never seen before.. for me i wanted to see more time Usamaro in the real story.. but however the the story seen pretty good without Usamaro.. Rin and Usamaro relationship as brother it's seem make things more complicated.. 
 
 
STORY: 8/10 
i already told about how good this movie story... so i have nothing new,, but still wants to say that this story needs something more 
 
 
Art: 7/10 
Characters look normal and not high enough..sometime it looks like weird,, because the color is too bright because of that some scenes more difficult to understand that what their main object.. others scenes pretty cool and love them 
 
 
Sound: 7/10 
sound system not that bad.. but still sometimes makes sound very noisy... but still like it..  
 
 
this is my first review... so not that good.. next review will make more details and make things more clearer

    No spoilers ahead... Now then boys and girls, this one is one odd, odd doughnut, and calls for as odd of a review, so here we go! 
 
The first thing I'll say is that I do recommend watching this, despite giving it just a 6. I would actually rank it 7, as my enjoyment of it was about 7.5/10, but I honestly can't do that as a watcher nor as a critic/analyzer, as the art, sound, animation and drawing style isn't anything outstanding nor special, and the story is pretty... 
 
Weak. That's the word I would use, but not a word that does it justice. You see, let's break the story further into smaller elements : first logic and consistency. They suck here - the motivations of half the characters are really realistic and we'll defined and executed, and the other half is illogical and full of plot holes more than Swiss cheese on roller blades. 
 
Next is the idea and setting. These are pretty good - nothing special but definitely interesting. Overall this means the story is slightly genetic, and seems to hit a snag on one enemy side, which seemed to be very poorly thought through thus it falls apart quite a bit, but not to the point it's not enjoyable to watch. 
 
What does make it interesting and worthwhile then? Again, said idea and world setting, but mostly - the characters and slightly unconventional way to tell the story!  
 
There are THREE DUOS of main heroes (which I normally don't like due to it usually meaning each barely gets screen time, but here it actually works great!) , and a few other secondary characters that are almost as central. You're mainly introduced to the world at first through the typical cliche confused shounen hero and his typically vaguely defined 'person I want to protect', friend, childhood friend and love interest in one package. Then the focus shifts more, and even completely to the other two pairs, and by the end the three start to juggle quite masterfully while interacting in fun, quirky ways. 
 
Now then that's about as much as I can say without going into details and spoilers, and that might not sound like much to go on, but I assure you said characters and their interactions ARE interesting, and anyone who read 'roadside picnic' or any similarly structured book will know just how much a shift in perspective from one character to the other can contribute to enjoyment, especially when the story's plot twists aren't a part of the said shifts from one story teller to the other. 
 
Final score ; 6.3, would definitely recommend, not as a must watch, but definitely as not too bad a piece.

    If a few months ago someone had told me that my favorite new series of the Summer season was going to be a slice of life series about five girls(and at least one boy) learning about sex, I would’ve raised a very puzzled eyebrow. I’ve enjoyed some very “sex educational” slice-of-life series before like Scum’s Wish or the more recent Domestic Girlfriend, but those kinds of shows had a much darker tinge that gave the innocence of their characters some engaging bit of edge. And yet, despite how innocent it is, Maidens of the Savage Season is shaping itself up to be a very mature and entertaining exploration of the subject matter. 
 
The main reason I say this is because we’re only 4 episodes in, and already the characters either have a very sizable amount of depth or, at least, a very interesting hook that’s got me dying to know more about them. So, here’s a quick, little break down of the five girls that make up the school’s infamous Literature Club: 
 
1) Kazusa Onodera. 
 
Kazusa is very much the plainest girl you could imagine. Her face, body, hair, demeanor, and style of dress all scream normal. This is in stark contrast to her childhood best friend Izumi who has, over the years, become one of the most popular boys in school. As such, with her we see a sort of self-deprecating attitude towards her feelings for him. Seeing all of the popular girls that are constantly trying to cozy up to him, Kazusa can’t help but feel inadequate. And, the way she copes with her inability to be with him, is by holding on to that memory of their youth and rationalizing that they are just too young to think about things like sex (even though they’re already in high school). This, hilariously, backfires on her by the end of the 1st episode and she is sent into a spiral of emotions that forces her to finally confront her true feelings for Izumi. As what seems to be the main plot of the series, the relationship between these two characters is nothing short of fascinating. 
 
2) Rika Sonozaki. 
 
Rika is the incredibly high-strung leader of the Literature Club. Though she enjoys the club’s main activity of reading out-loud erotic literature, the deep-seated shame of her enjoyment forces her to hide it very aggressively. The topic makes her, quite often, fly into bombastic heats of rage where she screams about the immorality of sex and insults all of the girls of her class that she considers to be “sex crazed beasts.” But, it’s clear that she does want a taste of that kind of life when, in a later scene, we see her buying a fashion magazine at a local store, but still awkwardly asking for a paper bag to hide it in. The scenes that follow where she is slowly forced to come out of her shell by a boy who has long had crush on her are very cute. 
 
3) Hitoha Hongou 
 
As the aspiring writer of the group, Hitoha’s interest in sex seems to be the most technical. She wants to be able to write great erotic literature like the authors that she loves, but struggles because she is simply too inexperienced to do so. She wants to be able to convey these scenes in a way that her readers would enjoy, but all of the manuscripts she’s submitted to publications thus far have resulted in her pretty much getting laughed out of the publication. Her strange, but proactive, way of fixing this is by joining an online sex chat. Without spoiling anything, this goes into some interesting directions when she finds out that the person on the other side of the chat is closer to her than she thinks. 
 
4) Momoko Sudou 
 
Momo, like Kazusa, is the member of the club who is most visibly embarrassed by the topic of sex. She is also one of the ones we know the least about so far. What we do know, is that she is a very kind and supportive friend who cares deeply for others. Also, even though we see the story bring a boy into her life, many scenes indicate that Momo might be our look into a girl’s coming-of-age story from a much less heterosexual perspective. 
 
5) Niina Sugawara 
 
Finally there’s Niina, the blond-haired beauty that is the object of affection for many boys in the school. Known as the “Jewel in the dung heap” for her involvement with the Literature Club, Niina does feel like the mysterious outsider of the club. This mystery deepens when she announces to the club that she wants to experience sex before she dies, because she might die soon. Like Momo, we know very little about Niina. But, the combination of her shocking declaration and her overall ephemeral demeanor, makes her a mystery that I am dying to learn more about. 
 
As you can no doubt see, this is very much a character piece. There isn’t so much an overarching plot as there are five stories that are constantly intertwining. But, so far this is perfectly fine because each of the characters has a fresh and interesting perspective from which to explore this classic coming-of-age story. This, combined with the pastel art style that gives the whole show a cute layer of innocence, makes for a very intriguing, engaging, hilarious, and heartwarming debut for this slice-of-life series. I wholeheartedly recommend giving this series a try to anyone who was able to get through their high school Health Education class without being a massive tool about it.

    I'm was very surprised to find that I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected, after the show which I thought was OK I wasn't expecting too much when I sat down to watch this. 
 
Oh boy, was I wrong. 
 
I'll get the boring part out of the way, the plot is there just to fill in the time between the tank battles.  Much like your average Jackie Chan film, the plot is there just to fill in the gaps between those awesome fight sequences he is so well known for. 
 
It's the tank battles we are all looking forward too and this film delivers in spades.  If you thought some of the stuff they got up too in the show was overboard, you ain't seen nothing yet.  Explosions, impossible tank manoeuvers, explosions, no consideration for safety, explosions, impossible tank manoeuvers and even more explosions (yes, I did repeat myself more than once). 
 
The opening sequence takes up almost a 1/4 of the films running time (yes, you read that right) and none of it is boring either, the use of CGI here really fits in with the look of the show, the tanks really work well in this form with the only let down being the commanders who look out of place riding on top of their tanks.  There are attempts at giving the cast more meat to their bones but that's just the plot bits I mentioned earlier to fill in the gap before the next battle. 
 
To put it simply, if you enjoyed the show than you will have no complaints about the film as the action is taken up several notches and on occasion runs riot. 
 
I now have an urge to find a video game that lets me command a tank.  
 
Panzer vor.

    This anime deal with tragedy Death,The viewers will deal with emotions that are express through out each character.This anime began with with a simple plot but actually contain many things in the story that will surprise us in the end of the story so don't just tell it is boring with just reading the summary. 
 
The plot in this anime is well created and well 'packed' but some of you might fell the anime a little bit to slow.The plot can be understand very easily just as you see the summary or watching the anime. 
 
Art based,it also very good,not to elaborate but still give a fresh look.I cannot talk many things about the Art. 
 
Sound is well used,The OP and ED sounds great,i like them both.The sound actor and actress get their job done well. 
 
Character is one of the strong elements that i see in this anime,Many character tell the viewer their feelings and some suspense through the story.Even the story is follow with Jinta and Menma as the main character at the first few episode,many characters is introduced and goes with the flow very well. 
 
Overall,it not just a drama with meaningless plot,I like to say that this anime is a great anime that has many very good things in it even with just 11 Episode.In the end,i want to tell that i like this anime because of it's plot,character and a great  way to show feeling and emotion and a Thank You for reading this small review. 
 I made this review because of i want it and also great anime that i watch across when i watch many other anime.

    This was my first rom-com anime and, though I've tried to find one that might top it, I haven't had any luck.  
 
Story 9/10: The premise itself is already different from the typical rom-com premise, and it stays that way as it goes on, so much so that, even though it's a slice-of-life without incredible plot-twists, you never get bored and it never feels predictable. The only reason I decided to dock a point off this section was because of the ending, which wasn't horrible but it could've been better. 
 
Art 10/10: The character designs take a bit of getting used to, and the art in general is pretty average, but there are times when it looks absolutely incredible, and during such moments you can definitely see just how much work they put into it. Apart from those moments, I really love the backgrounds, which might not seem remarkable compared to other anime, but they work really well here. 
 
Sound 10/10: I'd be tempted to dock a point because I don't really like a lot of the background music on its own, but the few tracks I do like more than make up for it, especially when coupled with the voice acting, which is generally solid, and sometimes mind-blowing. 
 
Character 10/10: Honestly, I only love the two main characters. I've seen this anime three times so far and I still haven't really gotten attached to the three very prominent side-characters. They are definitely fleshed out and very good characters overall, but I personally just don't like them very much, especially Ami, who I might call mature if she wasn't so annoying most of the time. However, Taiga and Ryuuji both make up for that. They're definitely some of the best character I've ever seen in anime, both individually and together. Their unique dynamic is definitely the leading factor behind my love for this anime. 
 
Enjoyment 10/10: The first time I watched it I fell in love with it in the first few minutes, and I marathoned it in two days, not knowing how empty I would feel when I finished it. I've seen it two more times since then, and it still manages to make laugh and cry at the appropriate moments.  
 
Overall 10/10: If there were more rom-coms like this, I'd definitely be a huge fan of the genre. As that's not the case, this would be my first recommendation to anyone looking for a good romance anime.

    Well since I am not gonna piss anybody of with this one, the kid gloves... stay on. It is not nice to excessively hurt a dying anime. 
 
This is the anime about the well known movie and it failed to deliver on the enjoyment that we got from the movie. 
 
The story is an a quest to get the ninja scroll from the title, but weird stuff is in the way. This normally would earn any other anime a 4 to a 5, but here I had the movie in the back of my mind and that made the story worse then I expected. It was a steeper slope down from the movie to the anime then I expected. 
 
The art and sound are very standard for an anime from the time so that is just fine. 
 
Characters... Well... Juubee is in it again and he is still fun, the problem is not him, it is the others. Juubee helps people that never come back in any way, not even in the way of a flashback about a lesson or whatever! Then the villain is not that interesting, which in the immortal words of Roger Ebert  ""Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph."" , so that would be a low score for that one too.  
 
These things make it all seem like one of those episodes of pokemon where Ash and whoever is with him is lost in the forest to [fill in blank] town and team rocket is trying to get a pokemon.  You get the idea that everything is filler but for the first episode and the finale. And that makes it a bad show, because it does not reward the spectator with a satisfying end where most things come together in one way or another. And lets just say that the end is a mind fuck for people that watched the movie and even for people that watched the show. 
 
I almost think this is a troll show (it is like if they in Basilisk suddenly say that the villain and a big good guy are babies in robot suits, that is how greatly troll the ending is, please tell me they did not do that in Basilisk) 
 
So, love, hate, objection or confusion is taking over your mind? Then let me know on my profile. I love all that.

       I personaly think that Black Cat was awesome . It has a great story . 
Even the way how they start the first episode is cool and has action. 
Which gets you interested . This a great  anime which you need to  
check out .  Especially if you like action.

    Simply put, I only watched the series so the critiques that were highly accepted, all of which rated this show as a disappointment (rightly so), would make sense.  
 
It's hard to imagine just how... unsatisfying this show ended up being for myself, but as a simple man that can be entertained by pretty much anything, I decided to watch it nonetheless. I heavily recommended reading all of the reviews beforehand (IF you even decide to tackle this beast afterwards). I can't even begin to fathom how frustrated I would have been, if I HADN'T known it was going to be so lackluster. I'll spare you the nitty-gritty- others before me have captured most, if not all, of the inherent failures of this show.  
 
Nonetheless, if you need something on in the background to help pass the time (I enjoyed folding my clothes to this show, because it lacked so much depth that I could easily devote half of my attention), then look no further~ Then, you can come back and enjoy the spectacle created by previous critques' comments- it's a good time, really.

    There are only two things to talk about; 
1- The games; Without wishing to spoil anything (As if the title doesn't give it away) the show is entirely about playing competitive games, in which the protagonist (Shiro and Sora , two siblings) are pitted against nearly impossible odds, gambling away very valuable objects  but somehow come out ahead. 
 
The tactics that they use to overcome seemingly insurmountable problems are extremely interesting to watch in execution but even more interesting after it becomes explained. It is one of those things that keeps the viewer on their toes (if he should so want) or can be enjoyed as popcorn anime without putting much thought into it.  
By the way; Sora (The Protagonist) is a con artist and it is glorious. 
 
 
And 2.... everything else. 
 
 
 
Basically, the ""Game"" aspect and the explanations by themselves would be a 10 out of 10 ... however, everything else is very flimsy; The world is underdeveloped, the characters are very flat and one-dimensional... the ""Comedy"" is repetitive and relies heavily on references to other shows. The ""drama"" (If you could laughably called it that) is overplayed and quite weak. It has a lot of fanservice but it's PG-13 ish fanservice and I hate that. 
 
 
 
But let's talk about the characters, specifically the three protagonists; 
Sora: Male protagonist insert. 
He is a NEET and apparently horrible at social situations. He has no friends aside from his sister and is , for all intents and purposes a completely inept loser with no future. He relishes being thrust into the new gameworld (Disboard) and wants to proceed into it with reckless abandon.  Super intelligent, super devious, super cunning, super quick on his feet (witty); He is pretty much maximum wish fulfillment for men.  
 
I enjoyed it, but he is very poorly written as a character however it works within context of the show. 
 
 
Shiro; Loli chara. Computational genius that wants Onii-chan to take his Imouto and everything that that implies.... anyway she is very flat; The core of her character is that she is incredibly intelligent, and yet she falters an awful lot. She is there to take some of the edge off of Sora and show he is fallible. It should not work in paper, but because of the medium by which they develop (Games) it works very well.  
 
Again, she is poorly written but it works. 
 
 
Stephanie Dora; Useless character. 
She is initially introduced as somewhat of an audience surrogate but is then relegated to being utterly pointless. She is mainly used in filler scenes where she is the local fanservice girl (Mmm not that I am complaining) and the butt of many jokes. She has low intelligence and in general, is not very interesting or at all even. 
 
These are the best developed characters; Basically the characterization is awful. 
However... there is a fourth character called ""Tet"" who we are given only glimpses of, this character has several mysteries about him and while that does not count as characterization, what we are not told shapes him sort of like water takes the shape of the container it is in. 
""Tet"" was the most interesting character if only because there are so many questions as to what he is doing and why.... alright let's proceed. 
 
 
The ""Story"" is atrocious. There is no real major arc, it's just stuff that happens... theoretically there is a starting point and an end goal but the majority of what happens is just a bunch of messing around. I know that was a short summary but the show basically has no story. I am not joking. 
 
 
 
Basically it is recommended on two fronts; 
- If you are a nerd like me and love game theory (GAME THEORY IS LIFE), then this is a magnificent adaptation of the concepts of game theory with large breasted anime girls thrown in (Yum yum). The writing is very rich and velvety.  
- Watch if you want a colorful popcorn anime with fanservice , anime references and games being played (Disregard tactics and tautology of game theory in no game no life). 
 
 
 
Do not watch if; 
- You want an intricate story 
- You want complex, well developed characters 
- You dislike fanservice 
- You dislike long explanations before, during and after scene 
- You want a well developed, rich game world 
 
 
Above average anime. 
Could have been great, is not great. 
Still it is good, gg.

    Durarara is a unique anime that comes everyday and confusion in the city of Ikebukuro. In this city gangs fight each other. There are many characters and the story is dense in order to develop the cast. 
   
Regarding durarara direction is good, to focus on struggles and actions. However, a lot of patience is required. There are slow and no action episodes, but they serve to develop the character and make it reflect the circumstances of that time. If we make a comparison, durarara x 2 ketsu is faster than the ten durararax2 which found only average. The script can be simple or complicated depending on who is watching, because we see the daily life of many people in the city and are often complex. One action leads to another action which in the end will generate a consequence. 
 
The art I found more or less. The animation had some variations, but nothing that generates absurd. The movement of the characters were not so perfect to be in fights. Durarara (2010) had a better animation, but still possessed errors. Furthermore, the anime changed studio (Brain's Base for Shuka) and this influenced. 
 
The OST is very good. That brings jazz climate in an urban world. Not only that: both the opening as the ending were good. Some piano touches moments of drama were good. 
 
Durarara has many characters: Shizuo, Anri Sonohara, Celty, Mikado, Masaomi, Shinra and Izaya hated among many others. Mikado occasionally made me angry. He was very indecisive and cowardly and it influenced the slowness of the anime. In the end, I even found satisfactory, but not as good. Sonohara had a good development and in the end she knew live together well with saika. The Celty finally found her head and formed a romantic couple with Shinra. The problem is that it would be better to head to join her, because during all this time the anime focused on that. The Masaomi had a worthy final and was the character with stronger personality. The Izaya .... the hated Izaya deserved catch. Shizuo did well to discount the anger in Izaya. Izaya was the articulator of all the intrigues that happened in Ikebukuro. So overall despite criticism, durarara has great characters. 
 
As entertainment, Drrr is good. There are confusing parts, but the story is interesting and innovative as Baccano! I really would like a continuation, because clung to the characters (especially Celty and Shizuo)

    Well, it's been a few years since I've finished Saiunkoku Monogatari and my memory's not that reliable but I'll do my best in reviewing this anime. 
 
I've seen some reverse harems; from classics to modern ones, but let me tell you this: Saiunkoku Monogatari still tops them all. (If not, then it's one of the best out there.) 
 
I came blind to this anime without knowing anything; the only thing I was expecting was for it to be underwhelming. But nah. It's good. Really good. 
 
Story: 
 
Saiunkoku Monogatari's premise about a girl from a fallen branch of their aristocratic family who is then offered 500 gold coins to join the imperial 'harem' for six months to straighten their unreliable emperor caught my attention. (Just so you know, I'm a maniac when it comes to governance,royalties,classics, politics etc.) 
 
The story for me was a hit; but on the other hand what happens after that would be 50/50; either it goes on full-blown romance with the emperor or it delves into politics with some good-ol'-life lessons. 
 
What did I get? Well I got a slow romance with some some politics (more on this on the 2nd season) bit more on life lessons about people,country and being a ruler. Not that I'm complaining, I mean it fits. 
 
Character(s): 
 
They aren't 'that' deep but the anime does give them background stories. It's just that there are MANY characters in the series to remember. 
 
As for the romance, I've no complaint (Though in the anime, it takes a back seat but it's there.) I mean falling for Shuurei must be the most logical thing to do. 
 
Music: 
 
It's not memorable but it does fit the story with it's classic instruments playing. 
 
Animation/art: 
 
Well, the animation for this anime is rather stiff. You'd mostly see people talking. (Not that there should be more moving;this ain't action anyway) The art's is also good and simple. 
 
Overall: 
 
If you want to watch an anime with a strong female lead,slow paced anime, with romance present and with life lessons to boot then this one is for you.

    Code geass is about Lelouch, a discarded prince of the kingdom of Britiannia, who is trying to destroy his father who is the Emperor of said kingdom as well as the kingdom itself so he can try to create a better world for his little sister Nunally. In the beginning he meets an immortal woman named C.C, who grants him the Geass, a power that gives Lelouch the ability to make anyone do anything he says without question. He soon uses this power to bring Britianina to its knees.  
 
Overall, this is a pretty cool anime to watch, the major theme of the anime (including the 2nd season) is that, for some people, power is like a drug: The more they get, the more they want, and they'll do anything to maintain their position. If you like death note, you'll definitely like this one.

    REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
************************ 
what a disappointment I have felt after watching this anime or let's say (shocked) 
I forced myself to continue the series to the end. 
first, let's explain something about this kind of animes: if there 2 persons (boy & girl) try to help each other and stay together for a long time, they will (by the time) fall in love at the end. I was waiting for last episodes to see that. So, why I'm watching it? well I care for the ROUTE between these episodes (1 and last episode) and how will be convinced. Simply, the episodes failed to make me convinced cuz nothing clear, nothing makes u think that those 2 (Ryuuji & Taiga ) deserve each other. During the anime, they help each other to reach the person they love and at last episodes (she) found out that she loves (Ryuuji) instead of Kitamura ?!  
and as I remember (until ep. 23) Ryuuji still loves Minori and (BOOM) what? we discovered he likes Taiga instead (surely by forcing him to like her  LOL!).  
WTF!! I didn't understand anything. How did Taiga forget Kitamura (suddenly) and start to like Ryuuji, where Kitamura has no one to love (after leaving that girl to America). Also, Ryuuji was honest in his love to Minori and she loves him too. So, nothing clear for me. She: ""I like (Kitamura) please help me and be my dog"", he: ""Ok, I will help u and I need u cuz I love ur friend Minori"", she: ""well"".  
she ""Oh, I'm jealous I love Ryuuji-kun"", he:""Oh, no problem I like you too, Minori go to HELL"". 
it's like: "" Ok, let's destroy everything hahaha (evil laughing)"" Bla bla bla. 
yes he said to Minori: "" I like her"" but I didn't feel he really likes the flat chest owner  :/, he said it with a completely stupid face. From this anime the only character I have liked was (Minori), she was clear in her love to Ryuuji (reverse her friend, she doesn't know who must like). 
When she found out her only friend (Taiga) likes Ryuuji, she decided to sacrifice her love just to see her close friend happy, also she's smiling, cheerful and funny most time.I really wished her to be with Ryuuji at the end,it really was so painful to watch Ryuuji abandon Minori until last episodes .after all this just an anime nothing real, BUT..... this type of people is found in our life, sacrifices for other people and (inside) cries but smiles as much as possible, another hated end. for the sound was good especially first opening and the art also good with some of enjoyment.I don't care for these things, all what I care about is the story and some of the art.Summary the story was so bad. 
An alternative end will be good, it saved my heart :D, here in this link:

    I had watched the first episode of Shokugeki when it aired, but dropped it when I realised it would be nothing but Cooking with Gary Stu. When I learnt this anime would have a sequel, I finally decided to see if it was worth it. Perhaps it improves after the first episode and I was being too harsh, I thought with all my heart. After all, it is sitting at a solid 8.6. And so I watched it. Turns out my original hypothesis was correct: It's a load of shit. Well, now instead of wondering about it, I can at least objectively state Shokugeki no Soma is pathetic. 
 
 
Story: 3 
 
I will say the premise behind Shokugeki is not bad. It's about cooking and battling, comparing skills with chefs of higher skill (mainly those of the Elite Ten) to become a better chef. Unfortunately, the execution needs a bit of work. 
 
Firstly, the first half of the show is boring. From the beginning our protagonist Soma is presented as nearly perfect. I'll go into more detail about him at the characters sections, but as far as the story goes, because Soma is so proficient at what he does, the plot instantly becomes predictable. Over 80% of this show is Soma facing off against someone who is meant to be higher in skill than him, whether they be part of the Elite Ten or not, but episode after episode he continues to dish out food so good it makes women (on rare occasion men) uncontrollably cream themselves. When the equation for every episode, especially in the beginning, follows as Soma + Ingredients + Cooking skills that surpass Gordon Ramsay = Food that can manipulate anyone to do anything, I already know what will happen in episodes five, six, so on... In the words of Edgeworth from 'Boot to the Head': ""How predictably boring..."" 
 
Secondly, the ecchi. To put it bluntly, it was overused. I don't have an issue with it if it pops up to 'spice things up a bit.' A good example here is Code Geass. Every once in a while there was a boob/panty-shot to lighten the atmosphere of a rather serious anime. Good. This is how it should be used. But when those shots BECOME the plot, it ruins an anime. Since we're talking about cooking, imagine ecchi like a fine spice. Sprinkled in, it adds a bit of flavour to an already good dish. Poured on haphazardly like the cap fell off a saltshaker makes a meal absolutely disgusting and inedible. Probably the best formula I've found for this is: If you take out the ecchi of a story and you no longer have a plausible plot, you might as well call it hentai. At least Shokugeki admits what it is, but even so, I'm not watching this to masturbate, so the show becomes even more boring and predictable. 
 
Thirdly, and I will admit this is a bit of a nitpicky one, but the story jumped around a bit too much. Usually a story has a stated goal which it follows. The story can branch off and create other short-term goals, but it doesn't usually sway from the long-term goal when that goal is the main focus. In this case, I thought the long-term goal would be Soma working toward and winning a seat in the Elite Ten, but this goal of Soma's seemed to die out the more time he spent at camp. This isn't necessarily bad as this added a bit of plot-specific filler content to the story, but Soma was so set on winning a place in the Elite Ten it was a let down to see that goal completely forgotten, as if it was mentioned mainly for introducing an interesting plot to keep watchers hooked. Of course, as I mentioned above, it would have been rather predictable given Soma's skill, but at least it was a goal the character had rather than just 24 episodes of cooking, beating someone supposedly more skilled, and moving onto the next person. 
 
Finally, the pacing is a bit off. In the beginning it was done all right as characters head to an academy to hone their cooking skills, but the last half of the show involving the Autumn Elections are incredibly drawn out for no reason other than filler. 
 
 
Art/Sound: 6 
 
Not much to say here. The art of the food was done very well. However, it was so detailed compared to the characters and everything else it was nearly overdone. 
 
 
Characters: 2 
 
I'll make this fairly to-the-point. Let's begin with Soma. 
 
Soma: As stated above, from the beginning he's shown as perfect. He's not presented with really any flaw nor backstory, and when he is, it's so much later on it doesn't matter. The purpose of the first few episodes should be exposition which is used in a story to sprinkle in bits and pieces of not only the premise and setting, but also who the characters are and a bit about where they wish to be in life. While Soma is presented a few times with the goal of becoming a better cook, it becomes a rather unnecessary goal when he's already surpassed other apparently brilliant chefs. Also, any flaws or backstory that do appear exist for mere moments. He's a lot like a cooking Naruto; hotheaded and determined. But at least Naruto's hotheadedness got the better of him from time to time and was something he could learn from. With Soma, it's a personality trait that all the tsunderes can't help but adore. So, really, he's more like a cooking Kirito. No flaws, really nothing to learn from besides one rival, his father, not much backstory, and all the ladies love him. Boring. 
 
Erina: Not much to say here. She's the bitch with the boobs. Like Soma, she has a bit of backstory, but that's put on the back burner (see what I did there?) in order to show off how truly rich and elegant she is and how much she can't stand Soma. At least she has him as a rival of some sort, but again, there is much development from this rivalry. 
 
Megumi: She probably had the most development out of anyone. She has a bit of backstory that helps her grow as a cook, but unfortunately she relies too heavily on Soma to make her truly develop rather than deciding for herself how and when to grow.  
 
Last, Takumi: Arguably the best character in my opinion. He has a sibling, he has a personality, and he has a flaw, no passion to cook, but even so, he worked toward a goal of learning how to cook. They should have made him the protagonist...or at least kept him in the show. By about episode 10 he's no longer around. He does make a reappearance in the Autumn Elections, but only briefly, so one of the most interesting characters is used for a few moments of rivalry with Soma only to be forgotten. 
 
Enjoyment: 3 
 
Shokugeki is not the worst thing I've watched, but certainly not the best. Certainly not worthy of that 8.6 rank. It skips exposition, introducing characters early on only to introduce their backstories and flaws and goals twenty episodes later. It completely cuts out characters with potential. The beginning is well-paced, but boring while the ending is drawn out and also boring. Its protagonist is too perfect while everyone else with potential and personality are used as side characters or boner-producers. Once it does become interesting, it's only for a moment before reverting back to the same formula: Perfect character is unbeatable, who would have guessed. In conclusion, this anime had potential, but didn't expand on it as unfortunately boobs are more important than plot and interesting characters.

    I'm sorry, but this was just... bad. 
i'll admit, I did like the animation and art, but... it's just the idea of it. 
I don't get why this was even placed in the yuri category, in my opinion, this is just lolis doing really weird stuff... it's just wrong. 
I'm sorry, but i really dont get why this was made, i mean why would you make 5 year olds drink pee? 
But, if this was a joke then i can understand, but this wasn't too bad i guess, all i have to ask now is that the creators be more careful about what they put in their anime.

    This is my first review, but it's one for one heck of an anime. Blue Exorcist has quite a good story, the artwork is so good that calling it first rate would be an insult, the characters are enjoyable and the sound & music was done really nicely. I'm not going to give the details, I can't do that without spoiling stuff, but I really recommend you to give this one a whirl. My only problem with this anime is a very common one- only 3 episodes have aired so far, wich means that there will be endless weeks of looking forward to the next episode ;). I give this one a 10 overall and recommend you once again to watch this- you won't be sorry.

    Before I start, I'll let all of you know that I haven't seen Brotherhood yet, but I've been told its better. I liked this show, but I thought that the ending left a lot to be desired. There's resolution sure, but it builds the world in a different direction than the one we already had going. This is in part I discovered because Hiromu Arakawa took the ongoing manga in a different direction than the studio adapting it, and she allowed them to change the ending. I felt that the dimensional timeline slip through the gate resolved nothing and only made everything more contrived and confusing, so I'm hoping I'll enjoy watching FMA Brotherhood and reading the manga much more. 
 
However this doesn't mean that the 2003 anime is without merit. Up until around episode 30 or so, this show just feels absolutely flawless. All of the characters have their own individual goals and flaws that revolve around the military’s harsh political atmosphere. Ed and Al find themselves on a journey to resolve what they tried to do, and it was so heart wrenching and compelling. The series had so many moments that earned sighs and even tears from me. The other characters like Mustang, Hughes, Winry, Scar, Izumi and even Tucker feel round and dynamic, and you feel their relationships grow with the Elrics as much as they clash with the brothers’ unique tenacity. I particularily enjoyed Hughes pulling the stick out of his ass that his corrupt and genocidal overlords put there.  
 
One of the most interesting aspects of the series I found was the obsession with the Philosopher's stone. On the one hand, its the resolution and antithesis to the well-built world of alchemy contained in the series. The large scale end result of which is the power hungry government using unethical science to wipe out Ishballan citizens. It stunk so strongly of something my hawkish government would do, I had to pause the episode and pause over how fucked it was I'm essentially paying taxes to Bradley (for context I live in the US). The obsessive quest to create the stone focuses the plot and cast and makes it a smart macguffin story of power, science and consequence. And Ed's atheist rant pertaining to science versus religion warms my heart and fuels the rest of his growth as a character. 
 
The most conflicting aspect of the series for me was how to feel about the homonculi. On the one hand, I found two of the sins' character arcs to be fascinating, namely Lust's change of heart and Wrath's arms' length (wink) connection to the Elrics. I thought that they did a good job of embodying the direct consequences of pursuing the stone. Their storytelling purpose seemed somewhere between Frankenstein's creature pursuing humanity and Roy Batty wanting his memories to be real. There were definitely moments where I could see their tenderness coming through, but their origin and why there were so many of them was never explained very well. I wanted to know how Bradley got so high in the government and where he came from. Gluttony, Envy, and Sloth seemed pretty interchangeable in their roles at times and lacked real character. Which is sort of the point of them wanting to be human I understand, but why did Lust get her backstory explained then? Again I feel these are questions that will be answered when I read the source material and the other adaptation of the story. To my knowledge the Homonculi were drastically changed in the 2003 adaptation, to the point where googling the sins names came up with conflicting results.  
 
This is a fantastic show with an asterisk. Its an extremely well built world with a focused world explored by a duo of tragic boys who are coming of age. But among all the explaining, homonculi being cryptic, Ed screaming questions to his antagonists, and the extremely rushed addition of Papa Elric, I ended up having positive, but mixed feelings about this series.

    For one reason or another, many people seem to dislike or just overlook short animes.  It's true that lots of them are bad, but it's also true there are some worth watching.  This is...a hard choice.  You may want to keep reading to find out. 
 
There is one particular genre that some people really love and some really hate: High School slice-of-life comedies. I, personally, can tolerate them, but twenty minutes is usually too long so I tend to get bored at times.  Luckily, for me and those who think twenty minutes is too long for this kind of anime, exist Morita-san wa Mukuchi.  A very simple High School slice-of-life comedy; It goes straight to the funny part and the episodes end with a punch-line.  Simple as that. 
 
The art is pretty good for a short, though nothing special if you compare it to any current non-shounen twenty minute-long anime. 
 
As far a sound goes, I find the OP really annoying, but the seiyuus are good enough.  Again, pretty simple anime, not much work in the voice department needed.  Funny thing that the main character is virtually mute. 
 
I only need one word to describe the characters.  Generic.  Good thing nobody was expecting anything different. Oh yeah! Did I mention the main character is virtually mute? Now the cast is has someone who is not THAT generic! 
 
All things said, I enjoy this anime. It's funny enough and it's only three minutes long.  Go watch it, you'll probably enjoy it.

    Utterly ridiculous, fantastically animated and with an incredible soundtrack, Kill la Kill is what anime is all about. 
 
From start to finish it provides incredible action as well as splicing in hilarious one liners and eccentric characters wherever you look. For me personally the plot is just very odd and doesn't have much substance, Matoi goes in many different directions with her motivation as the anime progresses and at times you can be confused about what she's actually fighting for and what the point of this whole show even is. 
 
With that being said, this is merely a reflection upon completion, and not for one second did I find this train of thought passing through my mind during the viewing experience. The action and soundtrack is just too good for you to even be bothered about what's going on plot wise. The animation style is varied in its style throughout, depending on the tone that needs to be set for the scene and is nailed every single time by the animators, they did a great job. 
 
The fan service is VERY prominent in this anime, so much so that it's basically part of the overarching story. So there's also that if you're a fan of such things (I'm pretty neutral in that regard).  
 
Overall though, the most important thing about an anime is if you enjoyed the time you spent watching it. And I certainly did, so give it a watch if you can

    I'll be honest with you: I only picked this one up because the title was fun to say. That, and it was only going to take up five minutes of my time per week (actually closer to four). 
 
Judging by the promo images and such you'd expect this short to be heavy on the ecchi side of things but we don't get that until episode 11 and that one episode where the A/C broke. Other than that this is just standard slice of life/ cute girls doing cute things. No need to go out of your way for this one folks. 
 
Although, I'll make the mostly throwaway comment that the ED is actually pretty good. One of the characters is supposedly a manga artist, (although that's just tossed out there once or twice) so the ED consists of pencil sketches of the characters in a carnival that is made up entirely out of drawing utensils set to a really solid and upbeat song just blasting in the background. 
 
Great, but should you watch this just for a pretty good ED? Fuck no. Why are you even still reading this? Go outside and start making better decisions than I have.

    RELIFE, 
 
I went into this anime with low expectations due to my perceptions of the slice of life genre being slow paced and outright boring (Looking at you Angel Beats!) That is why to my surprise I can conclusively say that I came out of this 13-episode rollercoaster satisfied and emotionally attached to the characters and their journeys. 
 
First and foremost, I must say releasing this in a Netflix style binge fiesta was a stroke of marketing genius. It has likely contributed to the surging popularity of the show here on MAL and definitely best watched over a short period of time. 
  
As with every review, I try to limit it to 500 words. Short but sweet as per say. 
 
(✓) Sound (6/10) 
 
Nothing really stood out here from a soundtrack perspective. The opening was forgetful and the OST maybe marginally added different layers of tension to scenes that required it. Thought it was pretty cool that the ending track changed for each episode; this was definitely a nice touch. 
A highlight for me was how each voice actor perfectly fit with the character they were portraying and paved way for the chemistry to develop between these characters. 
 
(✓) Art/Animation (7/10) 
 
Not much to really say here that has not been said by previous reviewees, the animation does not really stand out, nor is it required to as it’s a slice of life genre depiction that is not expected to product ufotable produced fate franchise production values. Everything seems animated to a satisfactory level and the output was consistent throughout. One highlight for me was the choreography of the final episode’s big reveal, it was perfectly directed and will leave you gobsmacked and applauding how well it was brought out on screen. 
 
(✓) Characters/Story (9/10) 
 
It take’s something special to create story that has characters that are universally loved by the audience. ReLIFE puts its characters at the forefront with the utmost confidence that they will succeed in engaging us through their dialogue and specific individual characteristics. Whether it’s Hishiro, Kaizaki or Kariu, they all have multiple layers of development throughout the 13-episode journey that enable us to care in suspense for where it might lead. At the time of writing this, I still cannot think of a character that I genuinely disliked on this show, I was paying attention throughout, which is an achievement in itself as I have the attention span of a goldfish. 
 
Story wise there has been critique from the MAL community for the pacing of this show, but in all honesty what can be expected for a slice of life genre and in general, it takes time to develop characters and clear a path for a story to be told. More so I was surprised by the cliff-hanger and have no idea where this story will lead to in the future. There are still many questions that need answering in (hopefully) season 2. 
 
(✓) Overall (8/10) 
 
The anime did the job of keeping me on board for the 13-episode journey and has led me to begin reading the manga, which thankfully the anime has for the majority of the time been faithful to the adaption of the source material.

    The second season of Bananya! Who wouldn't be hyped for this! 
After ranking the first season a masterpiece I was really excited for this one.  
 
Instead of in the human world/interacting with every day objects/life situations and sometimes even with humans themselves this season plays on the fictional Bananya planet. (possibly the origin story?) 
Every now and then meowteors (nyagareboshis) will fall onto the planet and bestow the inhabitants with unusual items to interact with (usually items from the human world). As the first season, most episodes introduce a new bananya character (like the zombie bananyas, emo-bananya or my personal favorite the elder bananya). 
 
This season continues to bring warm and fuzzy feelings to you every week and yet I'm personally missing the interactions with the human world from the first season that made it feel like bananyas were more a part of our actual world. 
The new characters are all fun, but unfortunately we don't see any of the characters from the first season (as of episode 9), except for Bananya.  
 
Overall, still enjoyable, fluffy, wholesome and BA-NA-NYAAAAA~~~

    The penultimate story of growth in a ninja. A story that took 15 years to tell on screen, 10 of which were in this series. A tale that spans exactly 500 episodes and leads to a feeling of satisfaction and completion. This is the legend of Naruto Uzumaki. 
 
Story: 9/10 
 
The story takes place following the events of ""Naruto: The Series"". Sasuke is gone. Naruto has gone to train with Master Jiraiya. Everyone else in Naruto's ninja class has some sort of training to do of their own. We come back from the 2 year time jump to Naruto's return to the Leaf Village. Time to start the endless train of action, suspense, and detailed storytelling. Naruto must prevent the heinous Akatsuki group from stealing the power of the tailed beasts to start a massive war that spans across the world, all the while trying to find his lost friend and return him home. While some filler arcs take place here and there and some episodes are akin to Dragon Ball in that there's a whole lot of standing around and talking, the action and set-pieces are a joy to behold and you can't wait to see what happens next. 
 
Art: 8/10 
 
As soon as the first episodes airs, you can see a difference in quality and design in the animation department compared to the first series. Vivid colors and detailed expressions are abound in every scene. Fight sequences are expertly choreographed and have your eyes jumping around the screen. On rare instances, the animation turns to a swift, almost comedic style, especially during rapid fight sequences (Naruto vs Pain). However, these changes in quality are almost endearing and help express the action even better in my opinion. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
 
The music and voice acting that goes into this show are stellar. Sure, we get a lot of Naruto screaming and shouting, but the emotional and happy points in the story are all worth it in the end. Seeing character's emotions on full display through voice acting is genuinely an art on its own. The music tracks that play throughout the story help bolster scenes and the emotions that viewers should be feeling. 
 
Character: 9/10 
 
This is the driving force of a story. Character development and how they alter and mature through the course of a series is paramount to its enjoyment. Here, we see characters change their views on the world and its outlook just on the basis of a few words. The power of words can be very strong, especially when they're wielded by someone who never gives up. Nearly every character that we got to know in the first series has a moment to shine at some point, granted it's 500 episodes in its entirety. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
Overall, I had a blast watching this series. I never read the manga, so I never knew what to expect during each episode. The occasional filler arc was a drag to have to wait through, but sometimes you get character development that you see further down the line due to what happened during filler arcs. Once the show came around the final corner and reached its end, I was both sad to see this show reach its end, but also happy with its conclusion.  
Then we got Boruto, which is a creature all on its own. You can read my review of that show to see what I mean.

    First of all if you have not seen this anime and want a comedy that can give you 10/10 enjoyment this anime is one of your best options. You ask why? Come on ,just think about it , an anime based on a plot that is hilarious to just even think about , it would be one of the best comedies there are to watch. This anime does not take any time for understanding, just watch one or two episodes and you are hooked! .This anime is a must watch if you ask me. 
A god of misfortune is sent to earth to extract the fortune from a girl who is disrupting the balance of the world by (unintentionally) absorbing the fortune from the people in her surroundings; due to her excessive power of good luck and fortune. Coincidentally, that god is also a girl visually in the same age as the girl; also if you see her, you are not going to accept the very fact that she is a god, LOL. The god makes a wrong entrance (suddenly appears in the bathroom) and leaves a bad impression on the girl and thus starts an EPIC battle between the god of misfortune and the girl ….. The girl has excessive amount of luck and fortune so she can compete with the god! Also the god has to buy different gadgets in order to set traps for the girl .To do so, god has to earn money.  This makes the situation more difficult in other words more funny.  
Episodes: Only 13. 
Sound: 9/10 (Great) 
  If you are thinking why I am talking about sound as my first topic of concern, then here is my answer, I loved its sound and music. Starting and Ending themes are really cool, I liked them and especially the ending theme song is amazing. 
 
Story: 7/10 (Good) 
  The story is not bad .Usually, comedies do not have very effective plot and they just turn in any direction regardless of the consequences and bad effects on the main story but this anime has a really   good plot not to mention it is still extremely hilarious.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 (Outstanding) 
 Of course this anime is one of the best sources of enjoyment for me. I just downloaded its first two episodes and watched them, to my astonishment, I was hooked! BEST ENJOYMENT EVER! Just one episode is almost enough for a day (as far as enjoyment matters). 
 
Art and Character Design: 7/10 (Good)  
 For a comedy, its art is awesome. Character design is just great. Characters are uniquely made and their reactions and impressions completely match to the situation. 
 
Characters: 8/10 (Very Good) 
  This anime is really good especially when it comes to its characters. Unique characters are used and they perform extremely well .Each character has a distinctive personality, I say ……WELL MADE. Each character makes a perfect entrance and makes the story more fun as well as interesting. Also characters have fairly understandable back stories. 
 
Overall: 9/10 (Great) 
  This anime is a rare piece of work .Only 13 episodes, does not take much time and it is OF COURSE worth watching. I have never been so much impressed from a comedy. So, all I would say is that I enjoyed it. I don’t regret a bit for watching it.

    anime of comedy with men who were transformed into idols I find it interesting, the series looks nice but I really doubt that it reaches something unexpected, has a very good animation I am surprised that they dedicate it really what I dislike is the empty empire in history lots of moments are never explained and are added as extras, I really do not find it necessary, its main field is comedy in all its sense I do not believe and I will never believe it has a good story, I would recommend it, I think maybe I do not like the series does not displease me but I do not really find that spark that makes me love it, I feel that the series gives everything but I find it difficult to place it as good as its plot although curious remains in it and does not advance.

    I felt at a loss when I looked at this season's anime lineup. It seemed crowded with a lot of action and supernatural-oriented shows, two genres I don't generally mesh well with, so when I saw Non Non Biyori it instantly stood out. Being a fan of the gentle, Ichigo Mashimaru-styled slice of life style, I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed.  
 
STORY: 7/10 
Story is never a strong suit in a genre that is based around nothing really happening. Non Non Biyori doesn't bring profound storyboard elements to the table, but you can't really expect that. It instead seems to offer very subtle undertones based on the premise of country life. The show follows Ichijou Hotaru, a 5th grader who has moved from the city to the country, and her friends, who happen to be the only other gradeschool children in town. Concepts of culture shock are touched upon lightly in Hotaru's occasional confusion of life in the country, and the connection between the main characters seems strengthened by the loneliness of being in such an underpopulated location. Story is taken lightly, as I feel it should be. 
 
ART: 10/10 
Mother of all that is holy, those backgrounds. I feel this is one of Non Non's strong suits, that being the art. A peaceful, countryside setting offers stunning scenery, and this show does not shy away from taking advantage of that. The first part of the first episode greets us with a collage of beautiful mountains coated in trees, gentle streams, and peaceful fields. The style of the characters themselves is solid and very cute, and the animation is fluid and consistent. 
 
SOUND: 8/10 
The soundtrack of Non Non complements the atmosphere of the show very well. It's peaceful, quaint, and traditional. The only complaint I have is the more intense music in episode 5, but it wasn't very much of a big deal. The voices of the characters are pleasant and fitting. 
 
CHARACTER: 9/10 
Here's where the slice of life genre shines, and Non Non doesn't fail to deliver. The anime is centric around four characters; Ichijou Hotaru, a mild-mannered fifth grader from the city, Koshigaya Natsumi, the playful sixth grader, Koshigaya Komari, the older sister of Natsumi, and Miyauchi Renge, the eccentric first grader. Each character has something interesting about them, such as Hotaru's loving obsession with her senpai Komari, Komari's sensitivity about her short stature, Natsumi's carefree nature, and Renge's... well, a lot about her is interesting. These traits are brought out through the interactions between characters in a fun, natural way. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10 
I really enjoy this show. It has the peace of a really gentle slice of life, but surprisingly has the ability to get me laughing or even tearing up a bit (looking at you, episode 4.) It achieves this in a subtle way that I just love to experience. 
 
OVERALL: 9/10 
I look forward to future episodes of Non Non Biyori. It's certainly my favorite anime of the season, and for good reason. If you liked Ichigo Mashimaru, then I feel you'd enjoy this show too.

    First off, for the sake of not getting bashed by other fans of this series,I would like to say that this is my first review i have ever written for THIS site...oh, people are still reading this? OK THEN! 
 
Take one love struck teenager of the same sex as the rest of the charecters who suffers chronic nosebleeds at the site of a female body, throw in a cross-dressing boy who looks as beautiful if not more beautiful than the rest of the FEMALE cast with a sadistic yet thoughtful personality, add a smart ,sarcastic, and monotone maid who does whatever the cross-dresser ask of her, kick-it-up-a-notch---(sorry Emeril)---with a love encassed priest who thinks all of Mozart's works are severe disieses, mix in a few great supporting cast members, and finally place a cat eared girl who looks younger than the rest of the cast as the dorm leader who is feared by all and is commonly refered to as ""GOD"" even by the narrator...ohh and have all take place in an all girls catholic school! 
 
That pretty much is what maria+holic is all about...and it's great. 
 
STORY: 10 
 
I gave the story a ten despite lacking significant character development because... when do you ever see a girl going all googly eyes over other girls to the piont that she needs blood transfusions and donations daily? Other than that, it is fairly straightforword... a reverse-lesbian harem? (ohh, and yes, i did just make the word reverse-lesbian) 
 
ART: 8 
 
I'm not the greatest art critique, my opinion may change if there is a second season, but compared to animes with the new art styles this is bumped down a bit from 10... But the art is pretty good. 
 
SOUND: 10 
 
I LOVED THE OPENING THEM SONG!!!---there i said it and im proud that i did... the opening just grabed my soul and made me laugh as well as fail my math test at school because i couldn't get the damn song out of my head! I also thought the ending was decent, as well as the lip synchronizing. 
 
CHARECTERS: 9 
 
SEE ABOVE+ you have the whole basic and expansion pack== the tsundere, the ditz, the athletic and sporty, as well as a few surprises from ""GOD"". 
 
ENJOYMENT: 10 
 
I loved this anime i really laughed alot  to the piont were i needed a gut transplant for some of the nosebleed scenes. 
 
OVERALL: 10 
 
I think that the concept was great and they really pulled me in with the hilarity and sarcasm... anyway if you want a good laugh give this a try... i hope you won't be dissapionted.

    Shinigami no Ballad is a rather short anime, but still well done. It is a pretty calm anime (Which means no action/violence) and it is innovative as it shows the duty of a shinigami (Also known as God of Death) from a different aspect. 
 
 
► Story { 7 } ◄ 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
The anime does not follow a particular plot during the whole time. Instead, it is an anime that consists of six different stories, one for each episode. Even though some may not like the idea of that, I must say that all the stories are rather interesting and very touching. The stories this anime has could make someone shed a tear and at the same time make that someone smile. 
 
 
► Animation & Art { 8 } ◄ 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
I haven't got much to say about the art. The way everything's drawn in the anime is simplistic; yet beautifully done. The art is certainly going to be something you will enjoy if you decide to watch this, especially if you like cute characters. Everything related to animation was really good. 
 
 
► Sound { 7 } ◄ 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
The opening and ending songs are both very slow, but you could say they fit the anime after you hear them. Also, the voices the characters have fit them really well. However, there are rarely any sound effects, then again, that's not much of a drawback for the anime so the sound is quite alright. 
 
 
► Character { 8 } ◄ 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
I really liked both the main and supporting characters since every character looked pretty real (If you exclude the fact that Momo the protagonist wanders around with a scythe on her hands {It'd be funny to see someone in real life doing that}). 
Anyhow, I'll now talk about the two main characters; 
Momo ⊱ As I've already mentioned, this is the protagonist in the anime. However, even though she is the protagonist, she does not appear very often, when she does, it is so as to influence her ""clients"" the way she thinks they should be influenced, she always tries to make them value their lives so they can live them to the fullest. I would like to add that she seems to be a very sensitive ""God of Death"" and is usually seen crying at the end of certain episodes, she's also pretty. One last thing about Momo, she appears in front of people who are still not scheduled to die. 
Daniel ⊱ This is Momo's familiar who always accompanies her, Daniel has the form of a cute cat with bat wings and is rather apathetic towards humans, unlike Momo. Daniel's voice makes him sound a bit like a child he likes to tease people. 
 
 
► Enjoyment { 9 } ◄ 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
I can most certainly say I do not regret watching this and I'd recommend it to anyone who feels like watching a series of calm and interesting stories regarding death and also regarding why people should value life. 
 
 
► Overall { 8 } ◄ 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
To sum it up, this anime is short but very well made and can move some people emotionally. Of course, everyone's got their own taste, as such, if you're a fan of action, blood and violence only, you won't like it as much as I did.

    Full disclosure time. I hope I can trust you. This is the only anime so far that has really and truly made me cry. That alone is impressive, especially if you know me well.  
How exactly do I describe Air? Well, first off, it is not eroge, you don't have to worry about that. Yet in a way, this is one of the more adult animes that I have seen. Air is somewhat of an arthouse piece. It doesn't feel the need to explain its themes, the story is fuzzy at points, and I would be lying if I said that I succinctly knew just what the hell everybody was talking about 100% of the time. But if you give this show a chance I promise that it will be worth it. I will not go into the plot, not only because the guidelines to the left of this word processor are sternly telling me not to, but also because the plot is meant to be seen through the show. Just take my word on this, it is offhandedly clever. The characters are also very endearing, from Yukito the wandering puppeteer to Potato the dog. The dub acting is really good as well. If you want to see the best performances that Vic Mignogna and Luci Christian have ever given, look no further than here. If you want a drama that can go from innocent fun to heart wrenching drama effortlessly, go here. Air is an odd specimen, but it is also one of the best animes that I have seen.

    ***I originally wrote this on Anime-Planet*** 
 
The following review has topics and videos that are not suitable for children. Reader and Viewer Discretion is advised. 
 
Critic's Log: Earthdate - May 21, 2012. Review #5: Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End Of Evangelion 
 
If you have read my review of Neon Genesis Evangelion (The TV Series) and its movie Death and Rebirth, Well this is it. This is the big one. This is THE END OF EVANGELION! 
 
 
This is the movie that either replaces the ending entirely, it can also be viewed as an alternate ending, and it can also be viewed alongside the final 2 episodes of the show, which I pretend it doesn't exist. This was a highly anticipated anime feature film for its time and the experience is unforgettable. Either you were mesmerized by its visuals, or you absolutely loathed its Artistic approach. Either way, this is a love/hate type of series. Here is The End of Evangelion. 
 
Third Impact has been prevented and the planet is saved. NERV unexpectedly finds itself under attack. Gendo starts to set up his main goal, and SEELE launches a massive raid towards Tokyo-3 in order to conclude their main goal at any cost. NERV must now fight its most fearsome opponent: Humanity itself. 
 
I apologize if this is slightly spoilerific, but that was just a little plot summary for this review concerning this movie. Moving on to the technical stuff.  
 
To be technical. This is a Gainax production and they really made quite the impression for most people. The first half is very good. The spectacular action scenes present from the TV show go full force and all out in this first half. Asuka's fight moment was probably the most epic action scene in the original series (for me at least). The second half starts out nicely until we are given philosophical, metaphorical, artistic, and ambiguous imagery and dialogue for the next 10 minutes until Third Impact begins. Then we get a glimpse of a really odd but interesting live-action scene of the film, I kind of understand the reason for the live-action clip but the meaning is a bit ambiguous. After the live-action scene, we finally start seeing the series wrap up into a somewhat interesting set up for the final scene. 
 
If you wonder why I am not mentioning much detail about all this. Because this is another mindboggling mind frag ending filled in with this philosophical psychological metaphorical mindboggling IMAGERY that is a bit hard to decipher which makes this ending a bit ambiguous just like the TV show's ending, but more visual. The Final Scene is both hard to accept and is ambiguous. Shinji and Asuka are the only ones left in the world (how Asuka came back is hinted a little bit before the final scene, but still confusing) Shinji decides to strangle Asuka and then he starts breaking down, and that is how Neon Genesis Evangelion ends. The ending sure has a lot to chew on, but I can't say the second half's story isn't much since all the imagery makes the story hard to analyze.  
 
The animation in this movie is a huge upgrade to the show. It looks twice as better than the show and the obvious reason is that the movie has a bigger budget than the TV show (which had a hard time keeping up with the budget). It is done well for its time, and the action scenes are spectacular in this movie. Gainax really went balls to the wall in 1997 and this movie proved it by then. 
 
The live action scene was a ballsy approach, but I don't know how that would help the movie in any means. 
 
When it comes to voice acting, The Japanese cast goes all out here. They have reached their peak with the characters in this movie. The English dub is nowhere at the same level. The dub is below hit and miss than the TV Show. I have watched this movie both dubbed and subtitled. I did not enjoy the dubbed version that much. 
 
I also have something technical to bring up in this movie regarding language tracks, there is a cartoonish sound effect added in the dub in some scenes. It added nothing to the movie and it felt out of place. ADR Director Amanda Winn-Lee (who was the voice of Rei in the Original series and this movie) thought it would be a good idea to add this cartoonish sound effect, I could not accept this at all. If you want to know what sound effect I'm talking about, find the scene where Misato kills a JSSDF soldier in the first half of the movie. Also, some sound effects that came from the Evangelions also are different in the dub. Fine by me... But Manga Entertainment sure had the balls to include all that in the 5.1 Japanese audio track and leave the Stereo 2.0 Track with the original sound effects intact with no additions so forth. I am not kidding, compare the 5.1 and 2.0 Japanese tracks and hear it for yourself. I was a bit cheated by Manga Entertainment with their treatment of this movie. 
 
The music by Shiro Sagisu is haunting and mesmerizing on most notes. It really fit the atmosphere of the movie. Komm, Susser Todd was a really interesting one to hear, because when the world starts, we hear a happy sounding catchy tune that is about suicide. The music is great during its first half and great during its mindfuck of a second half. 
 
Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End Of Evangelion was availiable by Manga Entertainment and is out of print. 
 
With all that said, The End of Evangelion is a visual feast. But it is not everyone's cup of tea. There are some things to like and some things not to like. When it comes to Evangelion. It is an anime that gives you a kind of feeling that can go in different ways, some will say it is awesome, some would say it is brilliant. Some people will love it, some people will hate it. All I can say is that this anime is ambitious and unique. It is ambitious that it puts in Action, Philosophy, Psychological intrigue, religious symbolism, and metaphors. It is unique that they tie in these elements and put them in with the relationships of these characters. This show is not all about giant robots, or action. It's about these characters that go through a lot of things and the show really displays that humans are fragile, whether it's mentally or physically. This is probably a safe bet that that is series' biggest strength, its weakness is probably that it has too much ambition. Is this an anime that will interest you into a psychology class? Maybe. Is this anime the greatest ever made? Not at all, I don't think it is worthy of being graded a 10 out of 10. Is this anime overrated? Yes, but I don't think it's terrible. I like it. I have already said this in my review of the TV show. This was my real gateway to anime, Pokémon was the first, but that was an Americanized version and I don't think it really counts much. This pretty much wraps up my trilogy of reviews of the Classic Neon Genesis Evangelion series from The TV show to the movie conclusion. I will review the remakes sometime in the future. 
 
I give Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion a 9 out of 10. It is EXCELLENT! 
 
Feel free to comment below and shine like a legend.

    A 10 isn't enough for this breath taking masterpiece. 
 
Watch and find out how an anime that aired for only 12 episodes, told a complete story compared to some of the crap that comes out today.  
 
Without spoiling , The story focuses around a young girl and her choice to become a magical girl to fight against witches, however its not all rainbow and gum drops as she learns there is more being a magical girl than transformations and looking cute.  
 
This anime gained so much popularity , from that success , it launched not two, but three movies. The writers know how to get your jaw to drop, that is for sure 
 
Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is proof, good writing and an idea on the dark side of magical girls can breathe life into a zombie like industry.

    Warning- kind of spoiler-ish 
 
 
Although there are many who seem to find a huge number of issues with this particular anime, it seems that most can't get over its ""BL"" component and the ""fanservice"" and actually acknowledge the good things about it.  It's not your typical sports anime where you can right off the bat tell who is going to win , which is probably its biggest achievement. I cannot stress how frustrating predictability is in sports anime, as there is no more adrenaline, suspense or hype. Finally, the angry and extremely hardworking ""antagonist"" won, that's definitely not your everyday outcome!! Besides, the characters were likeable- it was pretty much impossible not to like any of them (but this is, I am aware, 100% subjective). I am aware that the affectionate relationship between Yuri and Victor may come across as tacky and as ""bait"" for fujoshi/danshi, but I think that it blended beautifully with the unpredictable end (let's face it, everyone expected gold from Yuri K) and underlined the fact that you can't have it all and that's okay!! Sometimes just trying hard doesn't guarantee success, as there may be people who are trying even harder and their resolve is stronger. In the same time, not reaching your goal does not mean the end of the world and it does not mean that you don't have better things coming your way! 
 
Overall, terribly enjoyable, puts you in a terrific mood and is highly motivating!! A great anime for those who don't take themselves too seriously and know how to enjoy a lighthearted anime!

    i had no idea this was a ""short"" anime series until after the first episode, in fact i thought the video player had just screwed up and cut me off :P however the anime short thing was new to me but i honestly enjoyed it. when watching this keep in mind that there's not really supposed to be a story, just short videos leading up to some cute joke or something along those lines ""like reading a comic strip in the news"" ""actually these reminded me lots of the garfield shorts skits in-between the segments of garfield and friends."" ... you can finish this whole series in little over half an hour... this never really made me crack up laughing, but i was smiling the whole time while watching this ^.^ 
 - so, this is only like half an hour, and as valuable as your time is this show takes it with a cheap price, which makes it worth the bargain. :P

    “I don’t think it’s all that important. Why should I care about appearances and labels anyway? I mean, all that’s important is what’s on the inside right?” 
 
Anime is an art medium that has no shortage of silly rom-com’s. Unfortunately, it also has no shortage of mediocre ones. This is something I had noticed when I was first getting into anime and slowly but surely converting me into being the otaku I am now. However, one anime I saw some time ago that I really loved was Ouran Highschool Host Club. From the first to last episode, the laugh-until-you’re-crying-from-laughter comedy, surprisingly mature and emotional story-lines, lovably eccentric and very well written characters and unapologetic & frequent meta humour absolutely won me over. Of all the good or mediocre romantic comedies I have ever seen in anime, this one is one of my favourites. Why exactly? Well… 
 
*Warning, some minor spoilers ahead. There is a summary at the bottom if you care about spoilers or don’t want to read the entire review..* 
 
When it comes to writing, there are few things harder to nail than comedy. A multitude of elements all have to work synchronously including timing, atmosphere, witty punchlines and pushing a joke far without totally breaking the audience's suspense of disbelief. Ouran somehow manages to pull it off. It is incredibly not subtle in its jokes and pushing character archetypes to their extremities. Despite that, it works because of how they use these stereotypes situationally. It also has some great running jokes.  
 
One of the best recurring jokes is the fact that the Hosts (besides Haruhi) know very little of “commoner” goods or lifestyles. So every time that Haruhi (our heroine) brings one, it gathers a lot more attention than it deserves, making the other hosts both incredibly condescending and yet also genuinely giddish. In terms of both framing and comedy, this works so well because they have shown the characters to be unusually excited by such cheap and uninteresting goods, playing on the audience's expectations.  
 
Ouran also has some of the best comedic timing I have ever seen and the best example of this I can think of is one of the scenes I laughed the hardest in. This scene also shows all of Ouran’s best qualities when it comes to comedy.  This was when it looked like Haruhi was leaving the club for a equally hilarious and ridiculous Zuka club, who seemed to be a female parallel of the Host Club. The plan they finally decided on was for themselves to dress up as females, as they thought that appealing to her feminine side would convince her to stay in the Host Club.  
 
Now what I think works so well here and for many of the other jokes is how they unite taking a joke to hyperbolic levels of absurdity and still having it make sense for the characters to do in the first place. We have seen a lot of scenes of the Hosts dressing up in ridiculous and expensive looking costumes, so it isn’t too outlandish or jarring to see them dress up in drag. It also works as situationally, she has been hanging out with a lot of dudes due to her debt. It wouldn’t be totally out of the question for Haruhi to want to hang out with girls either, despite the fact that she doesn’t really care about that. Lastly, there was the pure shock factor too. Since it wasn’t foreshadowed or telegraphed, there is a lot of genuine surprise when you do see them looking very ladylike (at least, more than usual). 
 
Even though Ouran is gut-bustingly funny, what I think gets unfairly overshadowed is how good some of the more emotional scenes are written and the close bonds (sometimes a little too close) they share. As the anime moved into its second half, the narrative got considerably more serious. Ouran delved into the sadder or unfortunate circumstances that some of the Hosts were dealing with. It tackles a wide variety of common problems that adolescents deal with as they grow into adulthood, including acceptance from family, dealing with a strict family that has already decided your future or even loss of close family members. 
 
I honestly thought that Ouran was best when it was taking the goofy characters and having them mature and grow past their problems. It was written in a way to not only make these super rich characters relatable to (mostly) anyone else watching but it also made them more than just the tropes that the comedy often confined them too. They had balanced both the more serious and dramatic moments very well with plenty of great jokes and hilarious situations. 
 
If I really had any complaints about the writing, it would probably be the ending. Now the last few episodes were easily some of the best in the entire show. It for the most part brought some sort of conclusion to the main protagonists arcs and implied a potential romance blossoming… key word there was “implied”. Because the anime was airing while the manga wasn’t really done, there was only so much they could do about the ending. But since it is an adaption, comparisons to both the anime and manga ending are inevitable and the manga's ending was honestly far better. It provided a final resolution to the characters while resolving the romance as well and is by far my favourite part of Ouran (in either the anime or manga).  
 
But no matter how good your writing is, I believe the writing is often only as good as the characters and honestly, I think the characters are Ouran’s biggest strength. 
 
Haruhi Fujioka is easily one of the best female protagonists I’ve seen in a shojo anime. It’d be one thing for her just to be sorta tomboyish and broke as an obvious foil to the frivolous and rich Hosts. However, Haruhi is much more than just your atypical Shojo protagonist; she also is just an excellent character in her own rights. What makes her character work so well isn’t just her non judgmental personality or her keen emotional insight; its how much of a positive influence she is on her peers. 
 
As the show heavily implies, she and the Hosts live in two different worlds. Haruhi helps both worlds see more eye to eye. She helps humble them and be kinder to others (thus being better Hosts) and they help her normally anti-social personality to open up more, teaching her to also have fun along the way.  Which brings me to my personal favourite character in Ouran, Tamaki Suoh.  
 
Tamaki’s character development in some ways is rather subtle. He starts out being overly dramatic and downright obnoxious and in many ways, that doesn’t necessarily change.  At first, he just sorta plays the silly king/jester who is often the punchline to many jokes. As the tone in the show changed to focus more on character drama, we started seeing Tamaki for who he really is.  
 
Deep down past his obnoxious and goofy facade, Tamaki is easily the most selfless, compassionate and in many ways the smartest/most insightful Host. He was often able to understand his friends emotions even better than they were able to and hardly ever seriously asks for reward or acknowledgment in return. And when Tamaki and Haruhi were together, you were really able to see each other bring out the best of the other, making for a great romantic connection between the two. 
 
 Another notable friendship is the one he has with Kyoya. Tamaki managed to identify Kyoya’s inner turbulence he was dealing with because of his family, resulting in Kyoya being honest with what he really wants and even expressing himself in the way of his choosing. Lastly, another smaller reason why he stands out as the best character was that Tamaki did all this while still dealing with a mother who is missing and a very strict, cruel and selfish grandmother.  
 
Outside the main cast, there are two more characters I’d like to briefly touch on; they are the famous Hitachin twins, Hikaru and Kaoru. Their character arc primarily deals with their own isolation and how to interact with others. Hikaru (my favourite of the two) later on is shown to be rather emotional and immature, reinforcing his lack of consideration for others feelings. The best example of that is when Hikaru goes out on a date with Haruhi. He gets consumed by jealousy and even at one point, abandons the date in Haruhi’s time of need. Yet he still came back and was there to help her when she needed it. That was easily my favourite Hitachin bros scene as well as one of my favourite in the anime.  
 
The music in Ouran wasn’t super noteworthy, as it’s mostly just classical music with original tracks occasionally. Despite that, there are definitely some solid tracks that I found myself returning to. My personal favourite is the piano version of Sakura Kiss (the opening theme). It played during some emotional moments of the anime and it worked very well, enhancing the scene in the anime and bringing back memories of Ouran listening to just the track itself. The opening theme is also catchy as hell and brings a smile to my face everytime I hear it.  
 
From an art and voice acting perspective, Ouran is also very good. The animation and art direction was fantastic as usual by Bones, using lush, vivid colours while keeping true to the original artstyle of the manga. I can still remember the plethora of roses whenever the hosts are charming their guests. The voice acting was also spectacular. Caitlin Glass does a fantastic job as Haruhi, embodying all her snark and subtle compassion and fear buried inside. Vic Mignogna was amazing as Tamaki, embracing all of Tamaki’s silliness and obnoxiousness wholeheartedly in his performance. Other notable performances include Travis Willingham as Mori and Todd Haberkorn as Hikaru.   
 
Summary:  
 
Ouran High School Host Club is a fantastic standalone anime. While it’s last episode pales in comparison to the end of the manga (as it wasn’t finished), it still managed to balance hilarious comedy with great emotional drama. Its characters are incredibly loveable and memorable even years after watching Ouran for the first time. Honestly, I highly recommend watching this before reading the manga, as I think that it's the best way to experience Ouran for the first time. Afterwards, read or purchase the manga and read for the definitive ending, as it’s worth it for that ending alone.

    One of the more recent and popular Shounen JUMP titles, My Hero Academia comes to life in its well-deserved anime adaptation. 
 
As said within the show itself, the story feels like something out of a comic book. While that's true, that mainly pertains to the very beginning, or in this case the first few episodes. Though, I can't say it's similar to other stories, because the show has a unique twist with how superpowers, or ""Quirks"" as they're called, work and put into practice. I should point out that the anime doesn't cover a whole lot from the original manga. Even if a second season has been confirmed, I will admit how this season played out felt like there should have been more, like it could have had a second cour to it. 
 
In this universe, 80% of the world's population have these different abilities. No doubt, we're going to see some ""quirky"" characters (I had to...) somewhere along the way. From the elite heroes to the students in training, we get an abundance of fantastic individuals that give the series its charm. 
 
This season, I've seen wonderful cases of clean and consistent animation. My Hero Academia is no exception. Done by the ever popular studio Bones, they truly give the characters color and show great detail in the action sequences. It's almost as if it were an actual comic book come to life. 
 
I began reading the manga not long before the anime's premiere, and eventually caught up by the last few episodes. Despite what I said about how much was adapted, I still feel that it was well done. It makes me look forward to the next season, which I wasn't expecting to be announced so soon. If you've got what it takes to be a hero, then check out My Hero Academia!

    As an anime itself, I believe it was good.  It had characters similar to season one and the art was amazing as usual.  However, the main character is SO ANNOYING!  Alois, the main character-ish, to me is bratty, annoying and pathetic.  He is desperate for love and attention as well.  His backstory I know explained it all, but he's just so ANNOYING!  I want to rip his eyes out!  Claude is equally annoying as well.  He was an obsessed little twit who is disobedient and creepy.  The other characters, I guess were pretty decent.  It as a sequel, wasn't very good.  This was sort of a remake of the first season with almost the same characters, but different personalities.

    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the few anime I feel I can recommend to anyone. It ropes you in right from the beginning with its great story and characters. Each character is memorable in their own way. I like how the world doesn't revolve around the Elric brothers, unlike most shonen. However, some characters established in the beginning are left out for the majority of the story and the way they all conveniently pop back up towards the end feels incredibly forced. Also, some of the villains are generic and aren't nearly as fleshed out. Especially the main antagonist, Father, whose personality feels identical to any other shonen antagonist. Despite this, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an excellent anime and is a must-watch especially for shonen fans.

    Before watching Ouran High School Host Club, I had read many positive reviews and lots of people calling it their 'favourite anime ever' etc, and since it came out nine years ago, I was quite late in watching it just recently. So, I started watching it with high expectations of it being a hilarious anime with great characters. In my opinion, it's a good anime with some likeable characters. For me, its the kind of anime that makes you smile when you watch it, and smile when you think back on it. But it's not a particularly exciting show, and at times it could be a little long winded. That's not to say you shouldn't watch it - but continue reading to find out what I liked about it!

If you don't know already, the story is about a girl, Haruhi Fujioka, who gets given a scholarship to 'Ouran Academy', a very expensive high school for rich people, basically. Haruhi is mistaken for being a boy on her very first day, causing her to be forced into the Host Club when she smashes an expensive ornament. In the Host Club, the members spend their time entertaining girls who have 'too much time on their hands'. While she is in the host club, she makes friends with the members, and each episode is mainly about different events they host in their club, their main priority being to bring happiness to all girls and such. Many of the episodes revolve around just a single character, which can be nice to get to know them personally. The main theme in this anime is comedy, but there's also a lot of seriousness when you get to learn about the mostly sad things the characters had to endure in the past. There's no serious romance in this anime, I guess you could say there's a bit of puppy love, but I don't think the characters even realise it when they start to like another character. I'm being vague, because I don't want to spoil anything. The reason I gave the story a 7 is because I personally, haven't seen an anime quite like this before, rather than focusing on high school life in general it is specific to school clubs and it also gives you a lot of insight into the character's pasts, so you can really get to know them. While the story was unique, some of the episodes could get a bit repetitive for me, which is why it is only a 7. 
 
Art: 9 
I'm definitely not an expert on what is good art and what isn't, but there was something really nice and 'refreshing', as anime characters would say, about the way the characters were drawn. Even though this anime is fairly old, the characters are all really good looking and very unique. Some of the scenes in this anime are really beautiful, there is a lot of bright colours used, especially pinks, giving more of a cartoony feel to it. 
 
Sound: 9 
The OP is strangely addictive, I find myself singing it all the time. Some of the music in this anime is beautiful, mostly piano based, but the show doesn't revolve around this as it is more focused on comedy. 
 
Character: 7 
Some of the characters I loved and some I found myself growing tired of them. But, that's just because of my own likes and dislikes in personality types, so you can decide that for yourself. In the host club, every member represents a different 'type'. For example, there is a princely type - and while he acts charming in the host club, his true personally is completely oblivious and he is always making a fuss - which did start to get on my nerves, after a while. Haruhi has to be one of my favourite characters. She is the normal type, she's kind, funny and genuine - I basically think she's nice to everyone. I don't want to go into too much detail on the characters, since they all have their own qualities about them and you will definitely find some that you like, and some that you dislike. Having said this, the bonds between the characters are definitely enjoyable. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
I really did like this anime, but at times, the episodes became slightly tedious because of repeated jokes. For example, Tamaki, the blonde haired prince type, continuously calls Haruhi, the main character, his daughter, and overreacts when anyone goes near her. While this was funny at first, it quickly became boring. Some episodes focused on only one character, so if I didn't like the character.... the episode wasn't that great for me. However, the chemistry between the characters was great to watch. My two favourite characters, Hikaru and Kaoru, are really funny, so they made the show great to watch - and in my opinion, their past is the most interesting, so the episodes revolving around them were thoroughly entertaining. As I mentioned earlier, it all depends on which characters you like. But there will definitely be some, if not all, that you love. Some of the jokes made me laugh, like how all the host members are so clueless about life as a 'commoner' (as they call Haruhi), like they get excited over things they've never seen before such as instant coffee.

    Detroit Metal City, when i first saw the art for this show it like so turned me away for it for the longest time. Eventually i picked this up flipped it over and read what it was about, regret filled me soon after. This anime OVA is by far one of the best i have ever had the pleasure to view. I am embarrassed how long it took me to get into this. 
 
DMC is a really unique experience among anime, i can not name anything like it. It really took me by surprised and showed me it has like everything an amazing anime needs. Even though each episode is 2 segments each 6 minutes long it conveys a interesting and exciting plot. Shockingly the plot does not have a huge amount of holes or sloppiness, this show functions perfectly on such a condensed level. 
 
The sound was amazing having actual musicians compose more than a handful of songs to comprise the soundtrack i really grew closer to the idea of this band and understood what it stood for a lot more because of it.  The opening song is incredibly memorable titled simply ""Satsugai"" the animation video for it was what i can only describe as epic. This is opening sequence is defiantly my favorite part of this shows animation by far.  
 
The majority of the animation is done in a soft color pallet to contrast the dark under tones of the time spent in the Metal world. The duality of Negeshi is really focused on and emphasized in almost every aspect of the show. Though i would expect to get bored of it at some point the opposite happened, they kept it so fresh when the OVA was over i picked up the manga(Very Rare).  The characters are all very simple but the animation style is very unique with a different type of body per-portions and even features. The one thing i have to say is that it takes obviously a lot of inspiration from metal bands and especially the band Kiss using similar iconic face paint and costumes as well as the Title of the the band. 
 
My favorite character of this entire series is the over the top Record Producer. Being a foul mouthed sadist with nothing on her mind other than producing the ultimate metal band is by far the best fuel for this fire of awesome. Demanding and beating her own musicians into writing new songs and living a metal life style the word ""Refuse"" is not in her diction.She really drives the plot forward in a lot of ways cause with out her constant abuse and threats Negeshi would be left floundering in his life. I consider her the single most important character in this show cause without her the plot would nearly never progress, even in episodes where shes not present her influence carrys on to intimidate and scare Negeshis very way of life. 
 
The general atmosphere of the show was fun and enjoyable to watch. The pacing was good and it kept me entertained threw the entire show. They always kept things understandable for the viewer even if they had never been a fan of metal to begin with.The humor was excitingly original and unique and it can't be replicated easily. Even though it was about a Death Metal band it still did not make it ever feel really dark and scary, it kept that aspect light for the audience. The show frequently utilized the fans in plots even when not specifically at concerts or events. I really liked the fact random DMC fans would spring into action at the sight of Krauser even if it cost them there jobs. 
 
The one thing i can say should have been improved in DMC was the focus on the other members of the band. The bassist and drummer got about 1/2 Segment each threw the entire show and not much is show about them. There is some general talking between Negeshi and them but for the most part there left a mystery. Though the Pig actually gets a portion of the show which i thought was a good touch in general since it really shows he is not just a prop and can have some development. 
 
I really Enjoyed DMC as a fan of music and anime i can say this is a great anime. You must be able to handle the adult content and Metal music tho. The show is fun it works with a culture not seen in anime and it takes the music genre of anime in a new direction. This left me wanting so much more i wish i could only express it more clearly but in the chaos of metal nothing is ever very clear.The show is incredibly fresh and vivid and i have not had a viewing experience like it ever before. 10 across the board no part of this anime is a slacking.

    ""A beautiful work of art"" is perhaps the only way to describe this series. I must applaud the director, the writer/s, and anyone involved in planning every shot and every scene. They have broken my heart, and warmed my soul many times over throughout it's run. Whats more impressive is the way they could drop the devastating weight of a thousand worlds onto somebody's shoulders with the placement of a single shogi piece. 
 
The music, the dialogues and monologues, every cut, every visualization draws you in to each character so deeply that you can't help but to become them in that moment. Every character's emotions and interpretations of their own anxieties are just so beautifully and vividly portrayed.

    This is easily the most overrated anime of all time. When I first came to MAL, I didn&#039;t hear much about it. About August 2008 I started seeing it being recommended by people in the Recommendation forum.  I didn&#039;t pay attention to it. Fast forward to 2009, March to be exact, and I&#039;m seeing it being recommended left and right, and being hailed as the greatest anime of all time. Many people even went as far to say that if you didn&#039;t like LOGH, you had no taste in anime. So I started to think that I may want to watch it. I went to it&#039;s page and found that it was ranked in the top 5. 
 
That&#039;s when I initially started watching it. April, 2009. 
 
Now, I watched the first 7 episodes and thought to myself &quot;Well, it&#039;s starting off a little slow, maybe it will pick up.&quot; You see, by the first episode, I was already bored. I put it on my On Hold list.  
 
Then, September 2009, I decided I would give it another chance, I thought that maybe I just wasn&#039;t in the right frame of mind back in April, and that I really had made a mistake by putting it on hold. It turns out it was a mistake to put it on hold, I should have put it where it belonged - in dropped. 
 
You see, it never got any less boring. In fact, it got even more and more tedious, until it at episode 20, it began to be a chore to watch it. I would actually DREAD my anime watching time, because I had to watch LOGH, the &#039;great anime of all time&#039;. If I could give it a 0 for enjoyment, I would. Hell, this sounds corny, but I would give it a -10, if I could. Alas, I cannot. So I give it a 1. This is about the most boring anime ever.  
 
Shouldn&#039;t anime be enjoyable? If an anime isn&#039;t enjoyable, hasn&#039;t it failed? In my opinion, yes, Anime should be enjoyable. In my opinion, LOGH isn&#039;t. I know there are people who share this opinion, but are just to afraid to voice it, due to the people who actaully have the patience to finish the horrid show being vicious when disagreed with about the show, like rapid, foaming at the mouth Twilight fangirls. 
 
Story - 6/10 
 
Almost directly plagiarized from Star Wars. I&#039;m surprised George Lucas hasn&#039;t sued them. Imagine Star Wars, only with no light sabers, no plasma guns, and no awesomeness. Oh! And it&#039;s run by aristocrats from France. Alright, now you have Legend of the Galactic Heroes. If you haven&#039;t seen Star Wars, just imagine Star Trek, only more boring. If you haven&#039;t seen either of those, I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;re even reading my review. 
 
Art - 7/10 
 
Nothing to write home about. Very average. Almost everything I watched was a Laserdisc rip though, so you can kind of see how it might not look too nice. I mean the art really is truly average 90&#039;s art, which I happen to be a fan of. But that&#039;s it. Nothing special. I will add though that the command deck for the Empire is quite detailed.  
 
Sound - 4/10 
 
Subpar - not even worth getting into. Very little background noise, just voices, and  many annoying ones at that. 
 
Character - 4/10 
 
You know lots of people rant and rave about how human the characters in this series are. The trouble is, they aren&#039;t. Every character - stock. It&#039;s like the author of the original book (ahaha, yes I do know that much!) just got a list of all the stock characters of all time and just decided &quot;Whoop! I guess I&#039;ll use these!&quot; 
 
Yeah, so all in all, LOGH isn&#039;t worth your time, or hard drive space since the only way to watch it is to download. Most people who will read this review will probably be outraged. Hey - if this review has angered you, feel free to leave me a comment about it. But atleast be civil. Remember that everybody&#039;s opionion is different, and just because I don&#039;t agree that LOGH is the best anime ever doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m stupid, dumb, or have bad taste. It just means I didn&#039;t like LOGH. 
 
And that, my friends, marks the end of my review.

    ***This is a spoiler free review*** 
 
While I am filled with the most absolute joy towards this series than any other long-running series that I am currently aware of, there is also a feeling of melancholy as I watch this beautifully crafted mini-series end what has been such an amazing journey. The highs and the lows of the Monogatari series are coming to a conclusion (for now?)...and it is glorious.  
 
Story: 9/10 
 
While it might not be fair to hold what I am about to say against Owarimonogatari second season, it is an absolute fact; the mini-series just needs to bring lose ends to an end. Yes regardless of how Owarimonogatari second season ends it is not the final piece of Monogatari content (see the  Hanamonogatari anime adaptation and any other possible volumes that haven't been adapted) but it is the end of this story line with Araragi as the main focus (I think?). 
 
With that out of the way, Owarimonogatari absolutely concludes the series gracefully and beautifully. The first part is masterfully paced and does an amazing job at hinting at what is to come later on in the mini-series. The pacing is aided heavily by the soundtrack (more about that in the sound section) but it's also the dialogue and visual direction (more about that in the art/animation section). Without going into spoilers, it just needs to be said that this season is an absolutely amazing conclusion to the main story line of Monogatari.  
 
Art/Animation: 10/10 
 
Every time you watch something from SHAFT you think that “well this is SHAFT” not knowing that the next piece of media from them changes/evolves their “style”. While the Monogatari films have their own look, the tv series has been evolving this super clean animation and art style since the first season. It is safe to say that this is Monogatari at its best tv season wise. There are also a lot of very stylized frames of animation within this season. The first part has a lot of moments where the show looks completely different than the rest of the series yet it fits in and feels like Monogatari. The colors used scream visual keys as well as just plain appealing design. Characters look great, and the detailed scenes have very good architecture.  
 
This is simply the best I've seen SHAFT do in a tv series. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
 
All of the Monogatari parts (including the films) have amazing soundtracks. Some of them are good because they stay out of the way and aid in the conversations only a tiny bit (a lot of Bakemonogatari and some of Nisemonogatari) while the soundtracks can completely take control and dictate pacing (Tsukimonogatari). Owarimonogatari takes the Tsuki route and just takes you for a ride with its beautiful music. It dictates not only the pacing but also the mood very well. The music used towards the end of Araragi's first journey in the first part of the season is so masterfully done.  
 
The idea that music should not drive the movie/show (yes this is an idea circulating Hollywood currently) just doesn't make sense to me. Ever since Monogatari Second Season, the series as a whole has allowed the music to completely drive the show. I recently saw the film Dunkirk and the music was the main reason why the film felt so complete. You don't want the soundtrack/score to beat your head in with emotion but if you can nail that fine line of direction without being overbearing, you will enhance all emotions tenfold. Owarimonogatari second season absolutely nails this. 
 
The last part of this is of course the voice acting. Just...perfect is all I can really say. The second part that showcased Araragi and Senjougahara literally gave me goosebumps. 
 
Characters: 10/10 
 
Yup. This is it. This is the characters at their absolute best. The characters that make an appearance in this season do so with absolute style and class. Aided by on-point dialogue, visual direction, and a perfectly fitting soundtrack, they shine, fall, and exist with perfection. Since this season is the finale of this main story line, the characters have a spotlight pointed directly at them. Luckily, none of them choked. The performances were on-point and dramatic (when needed). Simply perfect. 
 
Overall: 9.8/10 
 
I'm really trying to not fanboy here but it's just impossible to not see the perfection in front of my eyes. The season did it's job AND SOME. It not only concluded what needed to be concluded but also somehow added in more character development where I thought wasn't possible. Thank you SHAFT for gracing us with this marvelous series. I can now safely say that the Monogatari series my most favorite long-running series. Say what you want about the fanservice whether it is needed or not, the series is a fine example of great storytelling. 
 
Enjoyment: ∞/10

    !Spoiler-free review! 
 
Introduction 
Time traveling in media is always a weird trope, as there are many different ""kinds"" of time travel with their certain rules. The problem revolving around that is to stick to these rules  over the whole plot, without creating or leaving too many plotholes. 
Without giving away to much, Steins;Gate is using a rule-set for time traveling which is rather simple but yet complex.  
 
Synopsis 
The Protagonist of the story is self-appointed mad-scientist Okabe Rintarou, he founded a lab together with his childhood friend and cosplay loving, calm and sweet, but also somewhat airheaded Shiina Mayuri and the perverted, yet skilled hacker Hashida Itaru.  
In this lab they research, invent and build so called ""future gadgets"" and their newest invention is a microwave which leaves food in a questionable stage. 
 
Plot-pace 
Steins;Gate manages to explain it's time traveling rules, while introducing new characters over the whole course and still leaves enough time for character development, plot progression and twists. It's a little bit lackluster that certain characters get more attention but it's rather minor regarding the whole wrap-up. 
To all those who like to have a proper wrap-up, most all of your questions will be answered  and only very minor question's are left open, only to get answered in other releases and adaptions like OVA's, a movie and of course the original visual novel. 
 
Characters 
Steins;Gate doesn't make it difficult to comprehend the actions of the main and supporting cast, while still having a rather large but healthy pool of relevant entities. 
 
Animation and art 
People who played original visual novel will find the art very similiar, compressed to fit in properly as an anime. The town-shots are lovely and the usage of dramatic, sad or thrilling effects to underline the situation is naturally and healthy. Steins;Gate character design is very likeable, it's nothing extravagant, but the characters are unique without being unnatural. 
 
Voice Actors(SUB ONLY): 
 
Music 
The Soundtrack is catchy and underlines the scenes and situations in a fitting manner. ""Hacking to the Gate"" is spoilerfree as the opening and fits the theme of this anime perfect. ""Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku"" is used in the first 22 episodes as the ending and often as a transmission soundtrack while cliffhangers or plottwists occur at the end of an episode, it's successful in building up hype and dramatic feelings. Wonderfulö 
 
Conclusion 
Steins;Gate's anime version is a masterpiece in itself. It's free of plotholes in a very difficult setting, has a lot of likeable and well-developing characters while still keeping up a good pace in plot progression. The Art and Animation is nothing fancy, yet still fantastic and seemless.  
The solution of Steins;Gate should leave you with an saying ""AHA!"", otherwise you weren't paying attention.

    hmm. my ability to evaluate the quality of this film is really hampered by the lack of decent english subs. i could tell that the translation was way, way off in several of the scenes, and some of the translations simply didn't make sense at all. 
 
bearing that in mind, from what i was able to understand of this film, i would have to say it did not live up to the promise of the first film. whereas in the tv series there was a little too much emphasis on the battles, to the extent that i could not follow who the Shinsengumi was fighting and why, this film went to the other extreme. consequently we don't see any of the battles that Hijikata underwent. instead we watch Chizuru journey to reconcile with Hijikata, which made much less compelling viewing.  another consequence of this change of focus was that the deaths several characters were very rushed, anticlimatic and lacked any emotional impact. 
 
speaking of Chizuru, her character regressed back to helpless damsel who never tries to defend herself, which was very, very disappointing. 
 
kazama was overused, at the expense of the Shinsengumi characters and his devil associates. 
 
the fate of Chizuru and Hijikata made more sense, and was an improvement on the series, given the scene that takes place between them in the forest.  and the sword fight between kazama and hijikata was ok, although i have seen better. 
 
the art and sound were good as usual, but ultimately this is a rather disappointing sequel. 5/10

    I nicknamed this show ""The Holler-Back Mermaid."" 
 
It's got the talking animals and other ""buddy-pal"" creatures. But it lacks the strict father (and henceforth the NO-FUN-WHATSOEVER drama). And the shounen lead started to accept the mermaid heroine early on. 
 
In a way: This show asks the ever-cynical viewer to have a heart for ""used goods."" Muromi, as a character, goes beyond ""used goods"" and ventures into ""nuclear waste"" territory. But she still looks like she's having fun (which is what life is all about to a certain extent). 
 
Takurou looks like a combo of Squid Girl's Takeru and Raildex's Touma. And I was hoping for him to give a ""Touma Punch"" to Muromi for her silly antics... Atleast he proved that he wasn't just another whiny self-insert; pulling some stunts on said mermaids and finding ways out of most of the situations. 
 
Yetchi and Harpie were cute. Kappa-Man was pulling a Suge Knight but really came off as an honorable yakuza. Everyone else was okay. 
 
I honestly don't know if I want to see h-doujins based on this show. But atleast it won't be boring.

    Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, or The Tatami Galaxy serves as an allegory for the fact that it is nigh impossible to achieve a perfect, ideal life and that you should rather take hold of the opportunities you currently. Animated by MADHOUSE, the light novel adaptation encapsulates the essence of source material quite well - the story remains undoubtedly one of the best anime has to offer and it's art is no joke either. You'll find yourself pausing numerous times to look up the definitions of words or read text that flies by because of the protagonist's fast inner monologues. The series begins on a very, very confusing point that had me re-watching the first episode multiple times to see if all that was said was relevant to the overall plot in any way. 
 
The bulk of the story follows one common episodic format, wherein the protagonist follows through an attempt to achieve an ideal campus life by joining various clubs and activities, but this never works out. At the end of each episode, these experiences are nullified, and the protagonist heads back to a point he was at previously for another attempt (unbeknownst to him). The story seems to be inconsistent, bizarre, but above all - it seems to have no connection to the story. For the majority of the series, you can't really tell what direction the story is headed in, but in the final episodes, all of these piece together in the most exceptional way possible. It delivers the most satisfying and conclusive ending of almost every series I have seen or read. The entire build up of the story is literally an ""OH SHIT"" moment. 
 
I had a somewhat similar experience with the art - at first, it seemed... sub-par. It looked cheaply animated and often utilized real life footage - I was shocked when I learned that this series was animated by MADHOUSE of all studios - but it was later on in the series when I truly began to appreciate how expressive it was - the animation was incredibly distinct and was something that had never been attempted previously. It greatly affected my enjoyment and I wouldn't have been as satisfied without it. 
 
The sound design was splendid, to say the least - the opening was fairly lacking in my opinion, though many will disagree with me. The opening was a cliche J-pop track by Asian Kung Fu Generation - on it's own, it stands fairly decently, but it does nothing to help the show. It feels lacking as it doesn't take the risky approach that the visual design and ending theme took, wherein the ending theme happened to be an extremely unique track that fit perfectly with the visuals added to it - to put simply, it was extremely reminiscent of the Space Dandy ending. The OST created for the show is entirely orchestral and very mellow - it fits well with the aspects of the series that seem to orient closer to the slice of life aspects of the show. 
 
The characters are few in numbers but most are fully fleshed out, memorable, and feel very realistic, much like the rest of the show's grounded nature. The ambitions and emotions of the characters become very clear as the running time of the show goes by - both the light novel and anime adaptation do well to bring life to the characters of this fictional world. This makes for a very enjoyable and relatable experience. 
 
I rate the show 4.5/4.5 Tatamis.

    	Mobile Suit Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket is if nothing else very different from any other gundam show I have watched. It is about how a young boy named Alfred and the nuetral space colony he lives on get dragged into a war situation , but this OVA is more about the characters than it is about the poltics or action.   
	I think I enjoyed War in the Pocket mostly because I believe this is the first UC gundam that just follows either normal people or grunt soldiers for the most part. There is much less of a focus on crazy newtype powers that were dominating previous UC gundam shows, or overly dramatic political plotlines .  
	Its quite interesting that we get to see part of the One Year War conflict through the eyes of a child in a neutral colony. Alfred was cute but difficult to watch through a lot of the OVA because you could tell how blissfully ignorant he was of the horrors of war until he actually experienced them for himself.  
	Through Alfred's interractions with the his school friends, his parents, the special forces squad of Zeon soldiers, a rookie Zeon pilot Bernard, and a beautiful Federation test pilot who looks over Alfred in Christina, this OVA was really great at showing the human side of all the characters. Most UC gundam shows make Zeon soldiers look like stereotypical space nazis but War in the Pocket makes many of the Zeon special forces team to be sympathetic especially Bernard in particular. You can see Bernard progress his relationship with Alfred very gradually and naturally and you get a very good sense of the bond they share. Its a great dynamic between them.  
	Alfred's bond with Christina is a little less explored but is still potrayed very well. You can see how much she cares about Al even through the first two episodes little hints that show she is watching over him were a nice touch. I also like the fact that she has her own explained beliefs and how she manages to be a really good mecha pilot without being a newtype. 
	The OVA is also great at gradually progressing through a shift in overall tone of the series from the first episodes being very happy go lucky and just gradually you are exposed to harsh realties of war through Al's perspective. 
	As good as the character interractions were, I still think the few action scenes were really well done. I liked how War in the Pocket actually make mobile suits seem more like the gigantic lumbering machines that they are. A lot of it is just the viewer approaching mobile suits from a child's (Alfred's) perspective. I thought it was interesting that he seems to view them more like cool toys early in the anime, but as time goes on and especially nearing and at the climax of the show, Alfred actually seems to realize just how awe inspiring and incredibly scary these war machines that bring death so easily actually are.  
	As much glowing praise as I have heaped onto War in the Pocket, its most certainly not without its flaws. Through the first few episodes I thought Al was really hard to watch him making horrible descisions against common sense even for a boy his age time and again , I thought in reality he could have easily got himself killed on numerous occasions. Also, with only 6 episodes there's not really an incredible plot to grip you . A criticism a lot of people have that I don't personally, is that the OVA starts really slowly and only gets good about halfway through. My opinion is that that slowness was used to good purpose in gradually settling you into Al's colony and seeing him maintain and build bonds with people. If they rushed that then the later events wouldn't be as meaningful in my opinon.  I guess you could also say that many other gundam shows have more engrossing mobile suit battles, which I agree with but that was never the focus of this OVA to begin with. 
	All in all this is a great show. It tells a touching story about war in a much less in-your-face manner that many other mecha or gundam shows do. It even left me with some meaningful messages. One : you really don't know how cruel war is until you experience it firsthand. Two : for the most part, the soldiers on either side of many conflicts can be eerily simular to one another and are often nowhere near evil dehumanized ""enemy"" that their government brainwashes them to believe they are.  Three : WitP shows you how fragile human life is in modern wars where we use weapons that can very easily snuff it out in a matter of seconds.  
	As an important note for War in the Pocket : you don't even need to watch the previous UC gundams to understand or enjoy War in the Pocket, but I think you'll enjoy it more if you watch 0079 at least to understand the conflict between Zeon and the Federation better. The other UC shows that aired before War in the Pocket are all chronologically after WitP so you don't need to watch those unless you're an avid gundam or mecha fan like myself.

    [THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS] 
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
 
(Heart of Glass) 
 
On April 25th , roughly a year and month later, Studio Hoods Entertainment have finally released episodes 11 and 12 of Märchen Mädchen. These two episodes will serve as the necessary closure  to this magical fairy tale, but after waiting for so long, does the show provide a “happy ending” or does it end in “darkness and despair”? 
 
After watching both episodes, the show does deliver a “happy ending”, but, that and the action scenes are the only good things from the show, everything else remains relatively the same. The story continues to suffer from cliches, weak and lazy writing, and lack of tension and buildup. The sound design contains the same opening and ending songs along with the same voice actresses. The characters continue to follow the same old stereotypes. The animations are better, but it's a minor improvement. Overall, not much has changed from one year ago, and that's a damn shame. 
 
STORY: 
 
Synopsis: Episode 11 and 12 picks up directly after Kuzunoha Girl's Magic Academy defeats the American team. From there, unimportant stuff happens (i.e., confrontation with the German team, discussions of worries and anxiety, Fleck monster, etc), then Lynne Daves, one of the American magical girls, turns psycho and becomes a Fleck monster. And now, everyone must stop this Fleck monster before it destroys all the Origins in the world. 
 
Of course, because this is a fairy tale, there has to be a “happy ending” and there is one. However, just because the ending was satisfactory, doesn't mean the rest of the show can be dismissed. In fact, everything up to this point was boring and cliched, and it didn't help that the composition was weak and lazy. 
 
Now, speaking of lazy writing, it's disappointing that there was no battle shown between the Kuzunoha Girl's Magic Academy and the German school, only the ending results were discussed, but that, too, was very disappointing, considering there was no clear winner. 
 
Some positive things about these two episodes include: an explanation into Hazuki Kagimura's power, especially “Glass Heart”; who Hazuki Kagimura's mother was and how she died; and the “confession scene”. 
 
Overall, while these two episodes provided the audiences with a solid conclusion, it didn't salvage the series and only prevented it from becoming bad to outright terrible 
 
SOUND/ANIMATIONS/CHARACTERS: 
 
As mentioned earlier, the opening song titled “Watashi no Tame no Monogatari ~My Uncompleted Story~” is sung by fhána, while its ending song titled “sleepland” is sung by Reina Ueda, both of which are heard in the original show. They are okay, although not very memorable. And as usually, the characters are voiced by the same voice actresses, and they do an excellent job, providing a whole range of emotion and energy. 
 
The art and animations are better than what was seen during the first 10 episodes. But, this is a very small improvement. These improvements could be seen in the fight against the Fleck monster, where lots of moving characters were involved and multiple spells were fired off at the same time. Other than that, the character models still look outdated and not very good, there were some disproportional bodies and objects and distorted or derpy faces, but not very noticeable. 
 
The characters still follow the same tiresome tropes and stereotypes that are common in the world of Anime. The Russians usually have short silvery hair with a military uniform, and come from a poor farm land. The Indian characters have tan skin with a headpiece jewelry and robe. The British, German, and American characters are all very competitive and have blond hair. And finally, there will always be one American character that causes many problems, or will start a calamity. And finally, the character's weapons and battle uniform are based on their fairy tale origins. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
Much like the ending to this show, where a miracle was needed to save the day, one could draw similar conclusions to its' overall status, i.e., it will take a miracle to make this show redeemable. And unfortunately, the ending isn't enough to redeem it. The show was hampered with production issues that led to awful and dull animations, off-character models, and lack of diversification for character appearances and facial expressions. In addition, these issues delayed episode 9 and pushed episodes 11 and 12 to more than a year. Still, even if production was amazing, the show would have to overcome the disastrous composition and awful story, and the unappealing characters. A hurdle that Studio Hoods Entertainment cannot overcome. And so, this marks the end for this fairy tale story. A story that will slowly fade into obscurity; never to be viewed again.

    Japan, a nation which was once known as &quot;samurai country&quot;, has been invaded by aliens called the Amanto who now pull the strings of the government.  The samurai have been forced to become ordinary citizens and sheath their swords forever.  Gintoki Sakata, a former samurai who follows his own code of &quot;bushido&quot;, was once a fierce warrior who can now barely scrape together the change to purchase this week's Shonen Jump.  What's a samurai to do? 
 
Story 
Gintama is not an anime that one should approach expecting a plot.  It's an episodic action and adventure comedy that details the hilarious and ridiculous daily escapades of Gintoki and the other boarders that are a part of his freelancing business.  The only thing that Gintoki, Kagura, and Shinpachi want is to be able to pay the month's rent but instead wind up attracting trouble like a magnet.  The jokes can be downright hilarious and the characters will literally go out of their way to say something funny at the wrong time.  It's not a series that I would recommend to new anime fans because a lot (but certainly not all) of the jokes poke fun at the anime subculture and even the more seasoned fans might have trouble understanding some of the Japanese cultural jokes to a point where it's like a Japanese Family Guy.  The fansubs do, however, take the time to explain a lot of the references.  It's also great to approach this series with at least some knowledge of Japanese history, particularly the Bakumatsu and Meiji Periods, due to the fact that a majority of the characters are based on historical figures.  
 
Art 
The characters watch television dramas and read Weekly Shonen Jump but the scenery and the clothes do a good job of reminding us that this series is supposed to be based on the Meiji Period.  The backgrounds are detailed and the animation is generally smooth.  Facial expressions, as with any comedy anime, are important and the character designs suit the characters.  The overall semi-realistic art style helps the characters seem more realistic as well, though, it's not something I personally found to be especially unique. 
 
Sound 
The themes are fun, catchy, and upbeat.  I found that one of the most memorable things about Gintama's music was the fact that one of the ending songs, Mr. Raindrop, is entirely in (good) English!  The background music does not particularly stand out but its &quot;wild&quot; style suits the anime.  The voices fit the characters well and the acting is excellent.   
 
And did I say that the most memorable thing about the sound of this anime was Mr. Raindrop?  I meant to say that the most memorable thing about this anime was the popular idol singer, Otsuu, who writes these catchy songs with crazy lyrics, like, &quot;Your brother is a hikikomori!&quot; 
 
Character 
Characters are the single most important feature in an episodic series such as Gintama and this is one area where this anime does not disappoint.  Every character has unique quirks that makes them interesting and the few &quot;archetype&quot; characters that are in this anime are parodies.  Shinpachi's sister Otae, for example, has the appearance of the typical &quot;sweet older sister&quot; character but she's actually one of the most violent characters in the entire series aside from trigger-happy Okita.  There is no &quot;self-righteous&quot; hero in this anime; every character is just another person trying to get by in the new Japan no matter how rude, weird, or downright strange he or she might be.   
 
Enjoyment 
This is the first series that I have seen in a long time that has made me truly laugh-out-loud.  I sometimes even have to stop myself from laughing while reading the manga in study hall to avoid being stared at!  
 
Overall 
The best thing about this anime is that it's not afraid to laugh at its demographic, its medium, its culture, or even itself.  It almost goes out of its way to make sure that it crosses the line.  And, even though some of the jokes are hit-or-miss references, it's an anime that can leave even new anime fans laughing or literally thinking, &quot;WTF?&quot;

    After this being my third or fourth time watching this series, I've come to the realization that I have yet to write a review for this show, Last Exile. And honestly, I've debated on whether I should or not because this is one of those shows that belong in that “special category” for me. Shows like ROBOTECH, Gundam SEED, Full Metal Alchemist, Cowboy Bebop and many more, where the word favorite doesn't really encompass the value or sentiment I have for them and besides, I have quite a few shows in this “special category” for them to be justly labeled as “favorites”. Needless to say that this show will get a perfect 10 from me, which is also another reason why I hesitate to write this review...because basically no one really respects a “perfect 10” review. It's usually written off as raving. But I think this show deserves it because, the story is very original and entertaining and also the art is awesome. 
 
~art 
Last Exile is probably the first anime I saw that alerted me to the fact that we were in a new era of animation. I've seen CG work before but it was never as smooth and seamless as it was in this series, usually you could have easily clocked it when an anime used CGI. The CG object was usually big and bulky and of a different shading and texture apart from what was used in the rest of the scene....one of the main reasons why I detest excessive CGI use. But here in Last Exile the CG work is blended really well with the rest of the anime scenes, you can tell it's CG work because the animation is rendered so smoothly in a way that only a computer can create, the way the vanships fly or how the smoke they release slowly diffuses in the air. Only a computer can render art that smoothly. But the art itself is great! I love the design of the vanships, so much detail was given to them they remind me somewhat of those classic cars from the 1930's. Another breathtaking scene in the series is the coronation of the Empress where a lot of care an detail went into the scene, even the train of her regal gown...there was also some good angle-work in that scene as well. 
 
~sound 
This show has a beyond awesome musical score, most noticeably, the OP and ED themes. Once again this show teaches me not to dislike all things computer generated because normally I greatly dislike all things “techno” and other similar synthetic music with computerized beats yet somehow and for some reason I loved the OP theme for Last Exile. The beat is very addictive and it goes well with the way the guy sings in that very slow almost hypnotic chanting style. The ED song is equally as awesome and it's what made me sit up and take notice of the performer, Hitomi. The way she sings is very soft and delicate and I've found it to be so relaxing that I've even used it on my MySpace page and people were always asking “who sings that song?” and “where can I get it?”  
I've only ever watched this show in English and they've done an awesome job. If you're they type that hates english dubs because they usually do such a bad job, then I recommend watching this one in english dub anyway to see that not all English dubs are done badly. 
 
~story 
I think it's kinda hard to put into words sometimes how great a particular show is, especially this show, because not everyone desires or likes the same thing....and as much as one person thinks this show is so “awesome” another person could just as quickly brand it as a  “lame” series, which I guess neither would be right or wrong, but I most certainly am of the party that think this show is beyond awesome! I guess I could say, that from an analytical standpoint the story has all the right elements to make it a very compelling series to watch. It starts out with these two kids, Claus and Lavie, who virtually have nothing but end up realizing that they possess quite a lot. That's not to say that this is a rags-to-riches story, because it isn't , it's more about surviving, being a survivor, it's also about having dreams and realizing those dreams. Having Claus and Lavie start out as one set of people in the beginning but then evolve and become different people by the ending is really interesting to see especially if you are into having a lot of humanness in your stories. Maybe that's why I love the show so much, because it wasn't just people fighting for the sake of fighting but there were believable human reasons involved: some for rage and vengeance, others for prestige and chivalry and others for survival. 
 
~characters 
Claus and Lavie are caught in a  maelstrom [literally] of politics and war, they're young kids who managed to eke out a meager but honest living as messengers and also as part-time racers by flying their late fathers' vanship. Claus and Lavie are I guess who would be the main characters, but the show also focuses a great deal on the crew of the Sylvana: Alex Rowe the captain of the Sylvana and a mere shell of the great pilot he once was, now consumed by vengeance; Sophia his second in command poised and capable she hides her beauty and many other secrets about herself behind her spectacles and dutiful facade; Tatiana, the dedicated vanguard pilot from a now defunct house of nobility who also struggles with her emotions...these are probably my favorite characters but the best character award goes to Dio the spoiled noble from the Guild, his quirky speech and mannerisms makes him the one that I could hardly take my eyes off of. At first he seems like a spoiled brat and then a gay stalker for Claus but even he too, grows and changes during the series and he eventually becomes someone likable and even a vital member of the team.  
There are many other characters in this series that are just as great with wonderful personalities. The character designs were also great. They were all attractive looking but none were made excessively beautiful except for those who were supposed to be beautiful like Delphine, Dio, Sophia [without the  glasses], Claus and Alvis. And it's not that they were super-duper jaw-droppingly gorgeous but the art style and wardrobe designs made them so. I really appreciated the great work that went into creating all the various wardrobes. I loved the design of the Empress's gown and the vanship flight suits used on the Sylvana, the fashion for The Guild was very unique as was the military uniforms for the Disseth. 
 
~verdict 
I don't think many people will get why this show is great because it doesn't contain a lot of the standard anime formulas, there are no giant robots, there are no epic battles with super-powers, the world isn't directly in any sort of great peril....the story is somewhat political. But it's a very intelligently written story with a lot of insightful characters expressing a lot of believable human emotion even though it all complete fantasy. It's definitely worth checking out if you've never heard of it or you've run out of anime to watch and are willing to try something new. the perfect 10 score isn't meant to be just me gushing about some show I like, but I do think it critically merits this score for being a truly original, intelligent and well-executed story.

    It wasn't a show I enjoyed. Primarily because the characters had no depth and the animation was poor. The story for what it is would be enjoyable for me if it had the cast to support it in an interesting way, the idea of someone who is an expert at killing goblns when everyonne else is specialised and aims to kill the Deamon Lord is an intersting idea. Exept that GS and his party have no personality or depth to make them intersting to watch. GS does get a small amount of character growth, but it forms more out of apathy then activly changing; for instance its said that he always works alone any he never forms a party, but he later does so with little protest when the party trys to spend time with him, and him now being part of a party is now 'character development'. 
 
The characters have nothing interesting to say most the time, everyone being summarized by one thing the like which encompasses almost all their dialog... 
 
Honestly I could go on and on, but the shows just isnt anything overly knew or well executed. It has some decent action scenes and is set in an interesting world, but the storytelling and character depth fall to short to be overly enjoyable for me.

    Hey, I'm Vice and I'm doing this so YOU can pick the right fapper for tonight. 
 
Hentai Subgenre: Device. 
 
In Short: A really cute tsundere, Airi, gets a stepfather who she doesnt really get along with at all, unperturbed he has an extremely powerful aphrodisiac spray he needs to test out... so he tries it on his new step-daughters... it works beter then expected 
 
Best Scene: The first time he uses the spray on Airi, how the effects slowly bring her to her knees. Slowly crawling away, pride still intact, breathing heavily... he nonchalantly fucks her until she cant resist anymore.

    Ok, once you dissect this story its pretty simple. This story is about a secret, you will watch the beginning and think that all thats up is that there's a town with fanatics, a huge blood lust, and strangely a ""Friday the Thirteenth"" vibe. But then you get into it and find yourself lost in a magic/science/religious mess. Finally, when you gather yourself together you realize that these people aren't drugged, they're not just plain INSAIN! There's something else at work. Anyway, this isn't one is those pity, sappy, dramas that are all the same. You know, those perverted anime with Cosplay girls who all go after one guy for some reason or another but he's a really nice guy who cant chose and doesn't in the end. No this story is why I LOVE ANIME. Blood, laughs, and a serious mind f**k. Oh yeah, and if you like this read the book ""Battle Royal."" It's not a manga it's just made in Japan. You know how crazy those Japanese can be. Hey, Steven King liked it.

    Finally picked this up after all my friends where whining about how awesome this is. Sorely disappointed. The main character is a loudmouth and I thought ninjas were supposed to be cool, not stupid 11 year old boys who make more noise than anything. The art is fine except the noses. These guys don't know how to draw noses. I suppose there are worse things than this to watch, but as it stands, it's barely above mediocore.

    Everyone loves a good underdog story and Megalo Box is exactly that, the restless stray dog vs the white wolf, it's a story of a man who climbed from the very bottom literally, to the top. 
 
 
STORY (9): Megalo Box has your average underdog story, a protagonist with talent and potential fights and struggles his way to where he belongs, along with the setbacks and speed bumps that come with it. 
 
 
ART (8): The art gave me a lot of nostalgia, it reminded me of the old 90s animes we all loved, the world and character design were very much on point, giving you that atmosphere of competition, and giving each character their own distinctive vibe that you could feel just by looking at them. 
 
 
SOUND (6): The sounds and music weren't bad, but they weren't amazing by any means, they did their job when it came to setting the mood, but there wasn't anything that catches your attention, although the rap segments that came every now and then were okay. 
 
 
CHARACTER (8): There are two types of characters in every story, the character that grows and evolves through out the story, and the character that stubbornly stays the same no matter what, Megalo Box gave us the latter, while I personally prefer characters that evolve, it did not fail to demonstrate how attractive joe's stubborn unrelenting will can be in a fight. 
 
 
ENJOYMENT (7): Overall I did enjoy watching Megalo Box to an extent, but it did however feel a bit too quick in my opinion, in a way it lacked content, it was very straightforward and head on, and that's not a bad thing, I just feel like this series could have become something absolutely amazing if they went more in depth in the story with a much slower approach with a 24 episode season.

    I think a lot of you rabid Escaflowne fans are gonna hate me for giving out this rating, which I can understand, but in my book, an 85 out of 100 isn't a bad rating. It doesn't mean I hate the anime. In fact, I really enjoyed Escaflowne. Heck, if I have the money, I can order the box set online and show it to a lot of my friends, as I think they'll really like this kind of anime. I don't deny that I can see why Escaflowne is so revered. It's one of the first anime to throw in both shoujo and shounen elements into one show. Heck, back in it's heyday, it outsold Gundam of all shows on VHS tape here in the US, and fansubbers jumped on it during the 1990s VHS fansub era, so a lot of people agree that this anime is definitely a classic that should be remembered for all time. Unfortunately...while I do acknowledge it's classic status, I don't agree that it's that great of a show. No no! Don't get me wrong. I still enjoyed it to quite an extent. I'm just going to have to explain myself in this review. 
 
I'm not going to tell about the plot because everybody and his freaking DOG knows that this kind of plot is as old as dirt. The characters are old as dirt, and it's ending is kind of old as dirt. I've seen a lot of people praise Escaflowne for it's awesomeness, and I do agree it is definitely awesome, but people are saying that it's a perfect balance of shounen and shoujo tropes, and how it's the greatest thing ever. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. Escaflowne is NOT a masterpiece. Why? Well, as I watched the show, I'm kind of surprised by not what people mention, but what they DO NOT mention, and Escaflowne has some pretty jarring flaws, a lot of which so many people actually overlook. What flaws? Well, if I could compare Escaflowne to something, it would be to a bullet train and an automatic machine gun that shoots bullets every second. It's pacing is so fast it's unbelievable! I feel like Escaflowne just throws stuff at you and expects you to take it all in without any question whatsoever. Basically, the show just DOESN'T CALM THE HECK DOWN! It's like it really really wants to show you this amazing, epic story so they throw it in your face and shove it down your throat without giving you time to swallow it. There are hardly any quiet moments in the show (except for the first episode and some parts in others), and the ones that are there don't last long unless stated otherwise! Not only that, there's little to no proper transition from scene to scene, and even from episode to episode! I watch an episode, then another episode pops up and doesn't even reference what happened in the last one and goes on like it expects you to go along with it without question! Everything just explodes at you and leaves a bunch of scars. Well, I can kind of see why it's execution and pacing are so chaotic. This was originally planned to be 39 episodes, but apparently due to time constraint issues and funding problems, they had to cut it down to 26, and even then the animators came up with too much animated material, so they had to cut quite a few scenes out before broadcast, and, really, IT SHOWS!! Maybe the episode extension would have rectified this problem. Well, a lot of people say this is a good thing because there's no filler. I can understand why they think this is great, and I agree. Every little frame of the show focuses on it's story and it is dead set on telling it, without any pointlessness (and I should also mention that the animators were strictly told not to give Hitomi any underwear shots. THANK GOD FOR THAT!!!) or extraneous material, so that I can praise...but maybe a little quiet, soothing, turn-off-your-brain-and-relax kind of filler wouldn't hurt. 
 
Now I must speak of the animation. Honestly, when it can be, it can be wicked awesome, especially in that part of the opening sequence when you see Escaflowne sword fighting with another guymelef (is that one supposed to be Dilandau's? They never say)! But yes, since this was made in 1996, it IS pretty outdated, but it's definitely aged a heck of a lot more gracefully than other shows in the nineties. Another thing I notice about the animation is that it's very distinct. It's different from other anime of it's time, and it shows. The noses are kind of big, but this never bothered me because I always thought noses were supposed to look like that in real life too. Not only that, every single character has their own look. No character looks exactly the same, unlike vice versa, which is becoming more and more apparent. Facial expressions are very distinct, but at times they can be very exaggerated, in the case of one character I'll mention later on. I love the way Gaea looks, as it's very European and Indian-based. According to some sources, Shoji Kawamori was inspired to make this after a trip to Nepal. You can really see the effort that the animators and art directors put into the setting, the art, the castle designs, everything. Heck, the empire of Zaibach just SCREAMS industrial revolution, and considering it's backstory, the whole industrial revolution thing going for it really fits it to a T. But at times the animation can be a bit static, and there are quite a few still frames, but hey! This was the nineties! Those were standard back in the day! The character movement is pretty good for it's time, too. 
 
The music...oh sweet magna carta, I simply MUST sing all kinds of praises for the music! Remember how I said once that I thought 07-Ghost had one of the most Godly, non Kajiura music in all of anime? Well, Escaflowne's soundtrack blows it out of the water here! Seriously, this was one of Yoko Kanno's first soundtracks for any anime (her actual first being Please Save My Earth). It's so hard to believe that even back then, Kanno had such an awesome knack for music, especially in terms of booming, classical, 1940s-esque orchestras and choirs, and I LOVE big, booming classical orchestras and choirs. Yoko Kanno pretty much fulfilled my musical wishes here, as every single piece of music fits every scene in show wonderfully. The epic choirs really bring out the epic in various fight scenes, though sometimes I do think some BGMs play in the wrong places, but that only happens once or twice throughout the series. I kept on wondering why everybody liked Yoko Kanno so much. Now I see the reason why, and I happily agree with them! This is a soundtrack I seriously MUST OWN!! 
 
There's been a lot of debate about the characters lately, especially on places like TV Tropes. I'm just going to tell my personal opinions about the characters. To be honest, as much as I liked a majority of the characters, I really didn't connect to them personally. For me, in order for me to truly love an anime and put it in my top lists, I'd have to connect with the characters on a personal level, particularly a majority of them, whether it's because I relate to their personality or the problems they face or feel sympathy for them, it all has to come down to whether I connect or identify with them or not. I didn't feel that with most of the characters for Escaflowne. Now don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean I hate them. If there's one thing I love about the characters in Escaflowne, it's the fact that every single one of them is flawed. Nobody's perfect. Even the characters who even look and act perfect have secret flaws they don't want others to see out of fear that they'd be hated for it. That's what made me really like them, and I think the staff behind the show knew this. Unfortunately, despite this, I didn't find most of the main characters very interesting. Oh God, I seriously hated that Mole Man. I don't see why he's in the show! However, I do like Hitomi. Not very many people like her, but I find her to be very realistic. She's not some overly perfect Mary Sue character, a violence prone angry chick, a big-boobed bimbo who throws her privates in a guy's face, a clumsy thick-headed ditz, or other dumb female stereotypes. I think she's a strong character and if you really take the time to imagine yourself in her situation, you have to admit her actions in the show are pretty reasonable and even plausible and understandable, though I can see why people don't like her much. I mean, seriously, she's a heck of a lot better than Miaka from Fushigi Yugi, right? I also really like Folken, one of the villains. Why? Watch the show and see! 
 
However...there is ONE character that I not only connected with on a very personal level for very weird reasons, but I actually identified with to the point where I almost relived my childhood memories from 4th grade when I still had my childish crush on a Yu-Gi-Oh character. I really like this character, and apparently so do a lot of other people! This character alone made me persist in continuing with this series despite the show's very jarring and obvious flaws. Who is this character, you ask? It is...Dilandau. Yeah, I'm a sophomore in college, yet I somehow not only strongly connected and identified with a completely psycho pyromaniac who likes abusing his compadres on a regular basis and setting things on fire and blowing stuff up for the fun of it, but am actually developing a fangirl crush on him! I know it sounds stupid, but it's true! Heck, other people had crushes on him in the 90s when the show aired! Yeah, I know, Dilandau's obnoxious, cocky, cruel, homicidal, completely off the ball, and acts like a spoiled brat throughout 90% of the show, and is basically everything that I HATE in a person, yet...once you learn about him and see him suffer horribly (even if it's for a little bit. The show doesn't go into too much detail about it for some reason), you feel your heartstrings get yanked and you want to save him once you realize he's no different from any other disturbed, lonely, scared teenager who just wants a friend, especially considering how young he is! He's basically the best and most developed anime villain that ever graced the silver screen. He's a villain, yet he's so relatable and in a way so human that you can't help but identify with him! He makes you laugh, makes you cry, scares the living crap out of you, he does it all! Why can't more anime villains be like him?!...if only his English dub voice were better! Seriously, I made the mistake of watching the English dub first and...oh my God, Dilandau's English voice is UNGODLY HIGH AND SQUEAKY!!! He sounds like he hasn't even reached puberty yet, and his voice actor was 15 back when the dub was made! How can a 15 year old still have that high a voice?! He sounds so chirpy! I mean, his actor does a great job at capturing his brattiness, arrogance, and his craziness in his really scary moments, and in other scenes the voice increases his cuteness (if he has any) in some areas, but I just CANNOT take Dilandau seriously with that BABY VOICE, especially in the creepy moments (""Cheek...cheek...cheek..."")! Wanna know the freakiest thing of all? Dilandau's voice actor does the voices of Shining Armor and Braeburn from My Little Pony, both of whom have deep voices! I can never look at them or listen to them the same way ever again!!! Seriously, Dilandau's Japanese and German voices are waaaaay better!...though the German dub actually ADDs to his creepiness and brings it up to so many disturbing levels it's not even funny...AND I LOVE IT!!! I need to rewatch this show in German sometime, even though I know NO German whatsoever. 
 
Okay, enough of all that random babbling. I already talked about this show's flaws so I see no need to go through them...though I do admit the ending is a little weird. But I've seen worse anime endings so I can give it a pass, that and it's not nearly as jarring as the rest of the show's problems. Escaflowne in itself deals with a lot of mature and heavy themes like magic, war, missing and illegitimate children, love triangles, and the concept of fate and playing with it. Unfortunately because the show is so compressed, I wasn't able to comprehend a lot of it. I do, however, definitely give Escaflowne credit for being a fun, epic, thrilling adventure show with a lot to love (I still can't get that soundtrack and Dilandau out of my head! Also, Prince Chid and his dub voice are SOOOO CUTE!!!) and it definitely deserves it's place as a classic. I just don't agree with a lot of people on WHY it should be a classic. Do I think it has perfect pacing? No. It's way too fast for me to fully comprehend. Do I think it's perfectly balanced? No, it needs more quiet moments, more polishing, and more development. Do I think it has great characters? Well, while some definitely stand out (Dilandau and Folken for me), the rest of them don't strike a chord with me. Do I think it looks good? Yes, definitely. Do I think it's groundbreaking? For it's time, yes. Do I think it has a great soundtrack? YES. 
 
While in my eyes it's not perfect, this is definitely an anime that should not be missed by anyone, and...come on! Who else agrees Dilandau is the best anime villain ever?!

    Do you like animes that make you think? Want something that'll give you something no other anime has given you? 
Then Higashi No Eden is for you, for those reasons and more! 
 
Basically, without trying to spoil anything, you have Akira Takizawa, a guy who has had his memory wiped and knows nothing of himself, standing in front of the White House naked with a gun and a cell phone. 
Then you have Saki Morimi, a normal girl who had never met Takizawa now about to be dragged into this whole mess surrounding him. 
Why was he at the White House? Why did he have a gun and a phone? 
Why doesn't he know anything about himself? 
 
It's honestly an amazing anime with a fantastic movie (King of Eden), I recommend this anime to anybody who likes suprises, romance and a plot to really make you think. 
An AWESOME anime, the only downside being that to understand every last detail, you should probably watch King Of Eden too. But after watching this series, you'll want to! ^_^ 
I recommend it to you strongly!! :D

I've watched under 100 anime, so don't take my word for it but why are you even reading reviews on this? Welcome to ""How to Be a Man: The Anime"" with your host Guts and his co-star Griffith. This is what happens when someone in Japan picks up a book on on the Medieval Era and then touches it up with some fantasy elements. I say ""some"" because none of that is actually present in the anime except in certain spots and in the last handful of episodes.  
 
The story follows Guts, a mercenary travelling from battlefield to battlefield scraping together a living and purposely staring death in the face. He encounters the Band of Hawks and through a twist of fate (and some dated battle animations) joins them. Their enigmatic leader, Griffith, has aspirations of one day ruling the land. Drawn in by the charisma and mysterious allure of his being, the Band of Hawks becomes a formidable army that Griffith leads on the road to achieving his dream. 
 
So starting with the story, it's about as generic as things can get. What separates it from other series of perhaps its genre is the way in which the story is told. We see things as Guts experiences them and we come to sympathize with the characters. While everyone has their own personality and own traits, only Guts and Griffith really stand center stage. This is fine; too many main characters can be bothersome. Thankfully, you don't forget about them and the scenes they're in are a welcome distraction from whatever else is going on.  
 
The animation is dated and a bit lazy in places, but that's okay. What makes something timeless isn't the small stuff, but how well the big stuff looks. And wow! Facial expressions and those many interactions are just beautiful. The art direction gives you a feeling of authenticity while the scenes that do capture actual movement last only long enough to show what they need to show. Not a wasted frame most of the time. 
 
The music isn't as strong as other stuff I've watched, but that's fine. ""Tell Me Why"" is probably one of the most weirdly upbeat and misleading openings of time, but still catchy enough that you don't mind. When that theme hits, you get pumped. Tracks like ""Gatsu"" are a bit out of place but still work well enough while the high-energy ""Forces"" is something you would expect out of a much more theatrical performance rather than an anime about a dude who ties logs to his sword and swings it 100 times as ""training"".  
 
So why is it the ""Manliest Anime of All Time""? Go watch and find out for yourself!

    Okay, lets get something out there, this show only has one thing going for it, Dante. I say this because there is litterally no story until the last few episodes, the other characters are a whiny little girl and some pissed off old guy, oh and some demon chick who obviously wants the D but she doesnt come around enough to really matter.  
   Back to Dante. Dante is the biggest badass ever! Dante is more badass than chuck norris, stallone, and jet li all together! I mean really he is so badass, his lifestyle especially; eating pizza, sleeping, eating some more pizza, strawberry shakin it up every now and again! Dante dresses like an uber-badass, red cloak, huge frickin sword, holy shit thats so badass!! 
   Dante can do anything be it a bike race, high stakes poker game, fighting off an entire legion of demons, hell he lives through being nailed to a cross, that right there makes him a bigger badass than Jesus-cuz he died, but guess what, Dante didnt!!  
   Dante is like the honey badger, he just doesnt give a fuck, he could go out and save the world...fuck that, he'd rather eat a strawberry sundae!      
The fights are all short as fuck but thats probably because Dantes such a badass that all he has to do is show up and look at the monster and BOOM they're dead as shit! 
   Honestly the only reason anyone watches, and can enjoy this show is because Dante's character is such a badass, and we just want to bask in his glory for as long as we can.

    Well i just finished watching Level E the other day and after some reflections i have determined it was alright. The series feels episodic for the most part yet there about 2-3 Episode arcs in this short run anime more than once. There was a few episodes i did not enjoy all that much mostly at the very start of the series but the middle and end really had some quality to them. Even though the series uses some slapstick style comedy and pretty cheesy jokes it actually has some intelligence to the plots involved. 
 
The characters of this show are really hard to kinda follow. At the start i assumed more people would be main characters but in truth this show is comprised of one main character and a dozen recurring support characters. The shows structure is rather unique this way and it kinda threw me off at first. When i reflect on the characters the 5 color rangers were probably the people i enjoyed most since they hosted a handful of personalty and got some good plots around them. The main character himself was pretty funny but there was not very much depth to him, he just likes causing trouble for the sake of his own enjoyment. 
 
The character designs seemed rather interesting mostly for the faces. The one thing i can really hand to the artists for this show is nobody looks like somebody else and there's a fair amount of detail to most peoples face. There was one or two generic sort of faces but i am pretty sure that was intentional since they were meant to represent a standard in some other genre it parody's. A lot of the show has a very plane sort of background but a few areas really stood out mostly the scenery of space and the winter episodes. Also a lot of devices used in the show and even the ships looked fairly different especially from each other and similar shows in the genre. 
 
The sound was fairly good, i liked the voice actors a lot since each conveyed the personality to the utmost of there ability. In particular Kraft had a very important vocal aspect since he was the only one who really gets completely worked up and emotional over the happenings in the show. another interesting thing is the opening theme, to me the first time i heard it was very different but because of this i remembered it a lot more and it started to grow on me. Overall the audio experience is pleasant and not really negative to the experience.  
 
The thing about Level E that just did not do it for me is i felt there was a lack of energy in the plot. The setups and delivery and even the general pace of the show felt very slow and drawn out to me. It may be just me who feels this way but at times it took me awhile to really get into the show for a extended amount of time. So the show itself is fine nothing to dramatically wrong with it but it just does not have the energy to really raise my excitement towards it. It was somewhat intelligent and well planned but the pace was just dragged at some points i feel that's all. 
 
Based on my viewing experience i give this show a 6 other people who watch this even if they feel it all runs smoothly i don't think will give it much higher than a 7.  I would say the show does not really reach a interesting point till episode 4 or 5 so keep that in mind with your viewing. When you meet the color rangers i think is when the show starts getting more active and humorous.

    I really didn't think the movie would have been anywhere near the anime. But with this one I was gladly proven else wise. The movie fit perfectly with the original story. It's like the movie was staring in a mirror, was virtually the same thing, but on the other side of the mirror. Subtle differences and the Kurisu's point of view. This allowed the movie to add 'extra' onto 'ordinary' 
 
To expand on Kurisu's point of view aspect, I've seldom seen an Anime in which the point of view is someone else other than what we've been used to throughout the main story. So when I realized this story was being told as through the eyes of Kurisu I was overjoyed to learn this. In doing such we got treated to something different. As well it allowed a bit more development for her Character and let us connect with her more. 
 
Overall it was a thrill from start to finish, equal to the anime in my thoughts. Didn't give you too much more. And it didn't package the same thing with a new label and call it a new product. Why my personal choice to why Steins;Gate and it's ova movie are member one!

    Highs: Smooth animation; stunning CGI 
seamless plot continuation; 
distinctive characters 
 
Lows: Nothing too new; transition between comedy and 
drama may lose some viewers; a not so spectacular ending 
 
Review:  As a direct sequel, Vandread: The Second Stage picks up exactly where the First Stage left off. Generally when dealing with a sequel we are left with an anime that tries too hard to better the original but in the end simply cannot compare. Thankfully, that is not the case as we have a powerful continuation that follows through with the strengths of its predecessor and takes it a step further to the next level.  
 
Unlike other sequels, The Second Stage doesn't try too hard to introduce anything new; rather it builds on what was already laid out in the prequel and jumps right into the action. Slowly, but surely more pieces of the plot are revealed and in the process does a splendid job of fleshing out and developing character personalities. The former cast all make a return appearance, with the exception one new face, Misty, a cryogenically frozen girl who brings new energy to an already jam-packed and fun-filled group.  The strong cast of characters is what drives this anime to success. Using several character-centric episodes, we can clearly see how the characters grow and begin to apply the lessons they have learned about each other and themselves, to help one another in their fight for survival. 
 
The visuals have been improved and are as impressive as ever. GONZO a specialist in animation does not disappoint in this regard. Vandread: The Second Stage looks like a high budget OVA, showing considerable improvement over the First Stage with the nearly seamless integration of the CGI with its surroundings that remained consistent throughout the entire series. Not only do we have a great storyline, but one that looks good telling it.  
 
Similar to the first installment, The Second Stage, manages to stay fresh and funny. As the anime progressed the atmosphere begins to change as most of the comedy is dropped for a more serious, dramatic tone. Some viewers may not be particularly fond of the loss of humor, while, some might see it as a welcome change. In any case, what we have is an enthralling storyline full of twists and turns and breathtaking action sequences that most would find hard not to enjoy. Although, there may be a common complaint about The Second Stage's questionable conclusion which, not to say lacks any sort of finale, rather leaves a lot more to be desired. 
 
If you enjoyed, Vandread: The First Stage, than this an anime you will definitely not want to miss. The Second Stage is a worthy sequel that concludes the series on a high note packaged full of all the cheerful characters and all the space action you can handle. So, grab this anime, buckle up and enjoy the ride.

    { spoiler FREE review } 
 
Goddammit, man.... I just have to say you must have a re-bound anime handy for after this show, because it will leave a gaping hole in your heart, begging for so much more!! 
 
Story: 
 
     The plot in Nagi no Asukara is very well-rounded, in that it blends all sorts of elements from a wide variety of stories so well that the product is truly, amazingly synthesized and unique. It takes a look at over coming segregation, and how all kinds of people can learn to not just get along, but to love one another with great magnitude. Love is the other highly touched on topic in this show, and it shows just how magnificent the power of loving someone with all your heart can amount to, even in the face of the most seemingly impossible and challenging situations. This is a story that is an absolute MUST to be experienced by both fresh eyes to the anime world, and well-watched veterans. Please don't make the mistake of missing out on this one. 10/10 
 
Art: 
 
     The artwork in this show was absolutely phenomenal, and is especially noticeable within the backgrounds. They're all so vivid, and almost like you're living in a dream world! Without even bringing the story into account, your eyes will definitely NOT be at a loss while watching this show. 10/10 
 
Sountrack/OPs and EDs/Ambiance: 
 
     Something that really put me into the show at first was the very cool atmosphere which the audio created for me. When the characters are in the sea, you feel like you're in the sea. When the characters are up on land, you REALLY feel like you're there listening to the soft hum of cars drive by and crying of seagulls in the air. As for the soundtracks and theme songs, well the emotion in the music of both just really went hand-in-hand with the story unfolding before your eyes. Even if you wanted to, I'm not sure how easy it would be to bring yourself to skip either the Openings or Endings to be completely honest. 10/10 
 
Character Development: 
 
     The character development in this show can in no way shape or form be over-stated. I had fallen absolutely in love with each and every one of the characters just after a few episodes. Trust me, you can look for one not to like, but it ain't gonna happen ;) 10/10 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
     While I do have to say that this anime was a whole lot different in that instead of being very happy and carefree all the time, it actually kept a somewhat tense and sad atmosphere for a majority of the show. Don't get me wrong though, this was a very interesting change of pace for me and kept me hooked on watching the next episode right away to find out what would happen next with the characters. I think you'll find though that this atmosphere is very suited to the show, and it wouldn't really feel right any other way. This anime was thoroughly enjoyable for me, from start to finish. I finished all 26 episodes in a matter of two days for goodness' sake! I think that should speak for itself. 10/10 
 
Overall: Um 10/10, duh. 
 
 
After-thought: 
....*sigh*. I tried hard to write this review without saying it, but I guess it has to be said after all. This is SUCH a better love story than Twilight ;)

    *Note 
this is my first review ever, so pardon me and my bad grammar 
english is my 2nd language 
 
This recent episode(10) gave me the urge of writing this review because of how it impacted me while I was watching it. So far this anime scores a 10/10 for me. I will admit that the first time I watched the anime from episodes 1 to 4 I stopped and quickly put it on hold; because honestly, I'm not quite the person that is fond of slow-paced, dialogue-heavy shows. Only a few shows have got my attention and Violet Evergarden is one of those shows that captured my emotional side. I would recommend this show a must watch and for those who dropped to give it another chance. Violet Evergarden is probably the 3rd show on my list that made me cry more or less than Anohana and Clannad with just one episode and the episodes before that. 
 
I want to address that while I was taking a break from the show I follow reviewers in youtube and they helped me clear up all the misconceptions I had with the show and also by reading others review on MAL helped me see what Violet Evergarden is really about.  
 
With that all said I'm very excited and am looking forward to more Violet Evergarden.

    When you start watching it from the beginning you think this anime is crap. In the beginning it would be true, story wasn't that good (nor it seemed to be moving towards good) and the creators seem to have a thing for naked people and putting things in males asses (this happens quite often). Those who want to watch it because it's porn just don't, because it's not (not even close). But around episode 16 things are not as simple as they seem and the story starts to get more complicated and interesting, but ending changed everything. As my conclusion kill la kill is pretty good

    As a long time reader of the manga series, I've looked forward to the various animated versions of Mahou Sensei Negima. The first anime adaptation was good, but it deviated too much from the manga, and attempted to play on the viewers sympathies too much. The second adaptation began well, but became a joke very quickly, and bore no relation whatsoever to the story proper aside from maintaining the character base. Of the two seasons, the first was by far the better, especially as Negima!? ended up as a very poor, supernatural style PaniPoni Dash. 
 
I won't even talk about the two OVAs, Haru and Natsu.... 
 
Upon hearing of the third iteration of the series, Mahou Sensei Negima: Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba, it seemed that hope was not lost for a decent animated version, especially as the story was supposed to follow events from certain chapters of the manga.  
 
Unfortunately that hope was in vain. 
 
The main problem with this OVA is that even though the story is pretty much the chapters from the manga in animated form, it's not really designed to appeal to anyone but fans of the manga. This is, unfortunately, a poor move as the OVA doesn't actually enhance the story or develop the characters in any meaningful way, and is little more than eye candy for the existing fans of the manga.  
 
That said, the Ala Alba iis a very good adaptation of the chapters it covers. It's so good in fact, that the viewer would be able to watch the OVA and skip the relevant chapters, and they wouldn't miss a bit of the story. As adaptations go, this is up there with the most complete. The biggest problem with it is that it won't appeal to newcomers to the series, or to those who have only watched the anime versions, as the story is taken from the middle of the manga so there's no real explanation about events or characters. 
 
As far as animation and design goes, this is actually very well made. The characters, backgrounds and settings are taken directly from the manga, with only a minor alteration here and there. The animation is fluid and the visual effects are well used. However, like the notorious Negima!? and the OVAs, this is a SHAFT production, and whilst they may be a great animation studio, they do have a tendency to do some rather odd things with animation at times. Their penchant for this rears it's super deformed head in this OVA on several occasions and, more often that not, it serves as a distraction rather than an enhancement. 
 
In terms of sound, the OVA will definitely appeal to fans of both anime series. The OP is a new rendition of the notoriously boppy ""Happy Material"", whilst the ED is a slightly more martial take on ""Kagayaku Kimi e"". The music used throughout the series has a decidedly upbeat tone which, given the lack of any truly serious events in this section of the story, isn't a bad choice on the whole. The sound effects are atmospheric and well choregraphed, with the most impressive being the distorted vocals when a spell is being chanted, which is then overlayed by the characters voice. The effect is rather surreal at times. 
 
The biggest plus for the OVA is that the gang is all here. The various (and numerous), seiyuu from both anime series, and the Haru and Natsu OVAs, are all gathered together once more.  
 
One interesting thing that arises because of this though, is how a different look and feel can affect how one hears things. This is especially true for those who have watched either, or both, of the other two series. The characters, as a whole, have become more, or less, likeable in the OVA, although I should point out that this is in terms of individual characters and not as a group. Given that each character is played by the same seiyuu, and is essentially doing the same things and behaving in the same manner as before, I found this changed perception gave the OVA a slightly odd feel compared to the other efforts. 
 
Negima is notorious for having oodles of characters however this OVA, being simply an animated form of certain chapters, doesn't really have the scope to develop them in any meaningful way. One thing that does get highlighted is the disparity in terms of ""power"" between the girls that have contracts with Negi, and those that don't. Aside from that though, there isn't really anything else. 
 
I did actually enjoy Ala Alba, as it made a nice change to see what the anime adaptations could have been like if they'd followed the manga. However, this is an OVA that will only really appeal to fans of the manga, although fans of either anime series who have yet to read the manga may want to check it out as it will give a taste of that version. 
 
On the whole, it's not a bad OVA, and it does have some plusses going for it, especially how closely it follows the manga. That said, I would have preferred to see something that added to the overall story rather than a glorified version of chapters I've already read.

The only reason that I gave this any form of 1 was because it had no story. 
 
As the writer of the original series said. You need to put in some comedy with the depressing and disturbing stuff. It keeps the viewers attention. And with a new disturbing arc and a few more seasons covering the other outcomes that the player of the games could have gotten. 
 
I really enjoyed this arc. Even though it doesn't take the same disturbing feeling of the other three seasons. It felt good to have it here. And how could you people not expect Ryukishi07 to put this into action.

    I would have to say that this anime was indeed different from others I have seen. Not just because of the excessive nudity and blood but the storyline was overall engrossing. From the first scenes of seeing a peculiar young girl with a helmet ruthlessly ripping the arms and heads off of guards in a isolated science lab, I couldnt take my eyes off my computer screen. 
Though I admit that the story sometimes seemed to drag on and not proceed forward with endless scenes of Nyu just sitting around naked while Kouta talks about his dead sister, you can look past this when things heat up when Nyu suddenly becomes Lucy. 
I do reccommend this anime to anyone who is looking for something short, suspenseful, and psychologically thrilling.

    Oh gosh, this anime was hilarious. Terrible in both video quality with stiff animation and characters, and story, that I was unsure I would enjoy it... But being the dedicated Yaoi fan that I am, I had to give it a chance since it was just 1 episode! Soon enough I realized the COMEDY was priceless, and there were a lot of hilarious and worth enjoying elements about it... I found myself laughing out loud several times. There were a lot of interesting/hilarious PLOT TWISTS that I didn't expect, which diverged from the standard Yaoi dramas out there... Unique, short and sweet... I would say it's not a TOTAL waste of your time if you've completely run out of Yaoi material to explore in video format.

    I didn't rate this high because of the ecchi that's drawn out everywhere. I rate this highly because of how the characters develop and how the story and or plot is good. The art you will love, the enjoyment you get from watching this is satisfactory, especially the ending which I cannot spoil. The main character actually isn't stuck up for once though a certain side character is. 
 
 
Overall if you like animes where MC gets stronger and dependable with a bit of drama then this is your anime. Just beware, don't skip a single episode, each one is super important.

    Hataraku Otona no Renai Jijou The Animation is one of those eroge adaptations, and eroge adaptations regularly turns out to be simple ecchi romantic comedi pieces of work, themselves severily criticized by angry reviewers. But this one is a full-blown hentai, and it blows at that ! 
 
Story (7) : 
 
The synopsis would tell you that the stories are just sexual intercourses by co-workers and the such ; you would imagine no story involved, but it is just what was defined. And ultimately, I guess the concept is well respected, as well as it does to explain the presence of an harem cast. 
 
Art (8) : 
 
Not only the backgrounds are well-made, the necessary for any in-public hentai, but the characters are all drawn moe, and that is a huge bump on my scale. Despite the presence of xray scenes (perhaps five times), who are to me a turn-off, there was one character who was surprisingly arousing. 
 
Sound (6) :  
 
First off, I keep the volume low, because it's a hentai. Secondly, I forget to listen to the voices, because it's a hentai. Thus I can't criticize the sound, and I guess it's one of the useless parts of the review system, that will stay here for the few users. 
 
Character (7) :  
 
The girls are drawn adorablely, and cute as well. But the more interesting character is by far Naruto, on her curves design. 
 
Enjoyment (8) : 
 
Can't talk about enjoyment on an hentai, it did the work. 
 
Overall (7) : 
 
This is a must-watch, so get out of here if you still haven't. You can find it somewhere on Haven. It features enough for a lot of fetishes, but there are limitations it does not cover. If you are also fan of the moe artstyle you should as well watch Sono Hanabira, although it doesn't feel like this at all.

    This is the first time I've watched a Netflix anime without knowing what to expect.  
I was pleasantly surprised. 
 
At first I was like ""What the hell's with this animation?!"", but later on I got used to it as a simple concise take on animation style.  
 
YES. I know that the Sabbath part of the episode was VERY WEIRD, but trust me. Later on, you would see how great this anime really is.  
 
Characters aren't really fleshed out in this anime, but for me, I just instantly admire them like I knew them for a while. That's why the ending took a huge toll on me and made me quietly ponder. 
 
The music is top-notch, almost as good as Death Note's OST. You don't really pay attention to it until certain moments happen. But you'll recognize them if you decide to listen to the full OST. 
 
As I watched Crybaby, I was wondering why there's no season 2, because I loved it that much! But the way it decided to end, I realized that there's no need for another season. 
 
**THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY!!** If you can handle blood, gore, and nudity, give it a shot. Basically, if you can get through the first episode without any problems, you're good. 
 
Finally, the pacing gets fast half-way through the show, but like the original Death Note anime, it makes you think about what makes up a human and are we really that different from other species or demons.  
 
Even though Devilman Crybaby is a remake, it is no where near like Netflix's ""Death Note"" or even the ""Ghost in the Shell"" live action movie. There's a reason why I gave it a 10. It's a masterpiece. More like a 9.5 
 
I just noticed that I compared this show to Death Note a lot for some reason lol

    As a person who is actually quite a lot into old anime, in fact even stuff much older than Slayers, I'm honestly bewildered by the amount of praise this show gets, and I think its status of an old classic might be heavily influenced by nostalgia. The anime is severely lacking in multiple areas, most of all it's just boring and completely devoid of anything unique. 
 
 
Slayers tells a story of Lina Inverse, a powerful yet inconspicuous magician who travels around, kills monsters, fights bandits and robs them of their treasure. Over the course of the show, new adventurers, starting with a travelling swordsman Gourry, join her party and together they explore the fantasy world. You know the drill, and have probably heard something similar many times, because this is nothing new. Nevertheless, this extremely popular idea can definitely turn out very nice and become its own thing, if the authors bring their new twists and details to it. Sadly, this is not the case with Slayers. 
 
Everything, starting with the setting, is bare of nuances and unique ideas. The anime is set in a generic medieval-fantasy world, with magic, creatures like trolls and dragons, princes, knights and the like. Philosopher stone and sword of light. Old and boring. There is also the demon-king sealed long ago and sought to be revived by his followers. You have never heard of something like that, have you? 
While this could still allow for a great and compelling story, with brilliant and interesting characters, Slayers definitely doesn't deliver, it actually doesn't even seem to try. 
 
The plot progresses in a pretty messy pattern, and despite not being very long, brings to mind 300+ episode shounens. It randomly jumps back and forth between important events revealing old mysteries, and completely meaningless, inconsequential fillers that shouldn't even be there, because they are neither interesting nor funny. 
The story just lacks direction. The characters don't pursue any real goal to drive the plot. Something is happening, our adventurers just get dragged into it, do their job to solve the problems, rinse and repeat. Some of it can be pretty cool , but it all feels kind of pointless. 
The mood and atmosphere also swing in completely unnatural manner, and it does stand out sometimes. Two characters are killed shortly after finally uniting with the main party, and you know what? Not even a minute later, the main trio is back at an inn, stuffing themselves and laughing out loud joking. There is not even a moment of grief or sadness, just a few shocked faces for a second. 
 
Speaking of jokes, the humour is one of the weakest points of Slayers. It's extremely repetitive, childish and ham-fisted, appearing regardless of danger or situation at hand, and is at fault in the show rarely having the proper atmosphere. Lina has small breasts. That is the joke, hahaha... I won't be discussing wether this alone is funny or not, as that's purely subjective, but repeating this time and time again, episode after episode, is definitely boring and actually gets quite annoying, even if it could be funny at first. Gourry is stupid and doesn't understand the simplest of explanations, Amelia is clumsy, trips over and falls on her face. Oh, there was another joke with Lina, you know, she's on her period and can't cast powerful spells then, isn't that funny? You know, it's THAT time of the month, wink wink, haha... 
 
This humour is also detrimental to characters themselves, because it's all around, and in fact pretty much defines them.  
While there is focus on Lina, and she does get enough screen time and characterization to be more than just her breast size, it's a real problem with other characters. It's hard to say anything meaningful about Gourry other than that he's stupid and has bad memory, and Amelia being also silly and clumsy, because most of their scenes are either fighting or reusing the old jokes. Most of the characters are just very poorly characterized and thus it's hard to truly care for them. They're not unlikeable, but they definitely are forgettable and undeveloped. This should never happen in a show that wants to be more than a silly comedy. 
 
The arstyle is mediocre, and character designs, save for Lina and Zelgadis, seem effortless. The animation is poor even considering the time it was made, and just screams low budget. Overall the anime doesn't look terrible, even if it's aged, but the visuals definitely don't help to make up for other aspects of the show either. 
 
The music is actually pretty good and fitting, and few of the tracks are especially good and memorable. It's nothing spectacular, but it does its job well, and in my opinion, is the strongest aspect of the show. 
 
Overall, Slayers is a very disappointing experience. It's a huge cluster of overused ideas and tropes. The story has weird pace and goes nowhere, the characters are basically running jokes, and at times just annoying. It's full of bad, repetitive humour and lacks fresh air, making the whole show pretty boring. 
It's not the worst watch ever, it's not offensively bad at anything, but it doesn't really have anything going for it either, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because there are shows better at everything Slayers does. It's just completely mediocre. 
I really can't see why it achieved the status it has now, and personally see it as just another, uninspired fantasy adventure, severely lacking in character. I would only watch it if you want to see what one of the most popular 90s anime is all about.

    I'm a bit of an oddity when it comes to watching anime. I judge a show based on how well it immerses me into it's world and how deep the story is. When I watched this, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story was fairly deep and wasn't very predictable like other animes I've watched. The art style was interesting and well executed, with the 'quantum' effects really hitting right how it should. The sound, while not particularly special, was used to further emphasize the emotional impact of scenes and the mystery of the quantum realms. The characters were a little typecast at times, but despite their personalities being a bit trope-y, it never felt forced. 
 
The main thing is that this is a slow-burner story, not some long adrenaline high like most mecha animes. Theres more time spent on creating the world and telling the story than mech-versus-kaiju fights, which makes the fights hit a little bit harder. It's pacing is slow and methodical, but that isn't a bad thing. 
 
If you go into this expecting action and excitement in excess, you will be disappointed. However, if you go into this with a goal to experience a story  deeper than ""we have mechs and there are monsters to kill"", you might find yourself enjoying this a lot more. 
 
Going a little deeper, the lore explaining the quantum mechanical 'magic' that goes on in this story resonates surprisingly well with actual quantum theory, although handwaved a fair bit to make it more digestable for the common audience. 
 
The only real complaint I have is the way they ended the story; it was a bit abrupt and felt like it was forced into a direction different than the story was heading up to that point. It still closed everything up nice and neat, but it felt a little bit like a deus ex machina. The ending dinged my score of the story a little bit, I would have scored it an 8 for story otherwise. 
 
If you like an intellectual story that forces you to think a little bit instead of vegetating on the couch (or wherever you watch anime), then you would probably like this.

    I did not see a review so I decided to write one. 
 
It's so sad to see such a good piece of music get such bad ratings. I feel the people rated this badly are unfamiliar with Nobukazu Takemura. Takemura this time brings us one of his jazz songs. Accompanying him is the vocalist Aki Tsuyuko. I personally prefer it when he has vocaloids do the vocals but Tsuyuko is definitely not bad. I do not listen to jazz that much but Takemura's work is excellent. I give the music a strong 9. There is not much of a story, it's just a girl playing with a blobby dude and pigs. 
 
Now about the visuals and animation which is what I believe is the culprit of the bad ratings, well actually the people who don't have prior of knowledge of Takemura are to blame. The video is in choppy, blobby, claymation. It looks like a kid made it and well that is intentional. I honestly would not be surprised if a kid did make the characters in the video. Takemura's music constantly focuses on the imagination that children have. So it makes perfect since to make it look like a kid made the video.

    Ah, I have discovered a fine piece of art. The perfect, heartwarming and relaxing anime with several of my favorite genres combined together. Romance and comedy. Kamisama Hajimemashita offers masterpiece soundtracks and a decent story where anyone can enjoy anywhere and everywhere.  
 
This anime saved my life. Before I discovered this anime I was at the urge of death from now being able to find an anime similar to Mahoutsukai no Yome. Although I have tried to watch other anime, none of them intrigued me. However, before I gave up my desire to watch anime I found an interesting anime called Kamisama Hajimashita.  
 
The anime offers me so many feelings that I have forgotten ever since Inu x Boku SS. Relaxing, funny and romantic. The plot and the character development was great, and the soundtracks are outstandingly good. And the quality and art style is well-made for an anime in 2012.  
 
However, the bad thing about the anime is the fact that the episodes are so short. Making the anime unable to show its true potential that it holds. Well, there is season 2, ovas and more but still. It's not enough! >:)  
 
I recommend this anime if you have nothing to watch and you're looking for some relaxing, comedy and romance anime. This anime is a SHOULD WATCH and you should really, really try it out.

    It's so far so good atm. And holy shit, i feel like im listening to an ASMR video whenever Tanaka talks man lol. And yo, dont forgot about that amazing jazzy, chilling, great vocals and melodic OST man. If i watch one of these episodes in a nice, calm and chilling park, alienated from other humans aside from myself. I would fall asleep right immediately lmao.  
 
Incidentally, the synopsis of this would be, the daily lives of a high school student name ""Tanaka"". Who have a natural talent for being listlessness, with his friend Ohta who's the opposite. And because he's the kind of a good person in nature; he usually helps Tanaka out, taking care of him due to the adverse effect that it has on Tanaka's high school lives for having the attribute of listlessness and indulging it, because ""it feels good"". In which they became best friend. Then they meet several others, with a pretty interesting attribution to each of the character presented. Some with a twist to their actual character, some pretending to be someone else just to be recognize among other (theme of appearance vs reality), and some having a raucous and Yankee like behaviour but actually weak towards cute things and inherently nice as a person. And the moe within this show is shining incandescently bright as fuck. And because of this, i can't resist the urge to see more of Tanaka in the future and the other character as well (especially Tanaka's sister, SHE's JUST TO DAMN CUTE!). These characters are pretty interesting so far, and unique. Plus their dialogue is pretty deep as well. One of these dialogue talk about globalization through the English language, some philosophy, rationalizing behaviour, evolution of humans etc. Some things that i have never expected a show like this to start talking about lol. But it was delivered so well and interesting coz it was deliver by our 2 stoic faces characters, Ohta and Tanaka. While Tanaka is listless, and stoic. His characters make him look like a quiet child that needs to be help in a lot ways. So you will get this feeling of spoiling him, or not wanting to left him alone to sulk. Because, ummmm. Im a guy but he's just too adorable man LOL. No homo. Just moe... Really... 
 
These includes the act of wanting to carrying him to class (Ohta my man), carrying him to his home (Ohta again), carrying him to his home or his friend's house (Ohta again...). Yea he can't live without someone to help him get through his day, because he's really just too tired to do anything by himself lol. This makes Tanaka as a character alot cuter than he actually is without his silliness and ideas that will baffle us that will make us think, ""Why did you think like that man?"" or ""Tanaka... Dude how did you come into that conclusion lmao"", or just simply, ""WTF Tanaka"". 
 
Not only that, these characters, especially Tanaka are very unique and some of the very deep or touchy moment of this anime thus far are affected by his personalities as well. They are pretty good, while not having that pertinent to the cliche that we usually sees in a scene in relation to those parts. It's more of a self aware kinda thing for a character such as Tanaka which makes those scene alot more unique than the other anime out there. Probably because this is not an anime to stress yourself out into thinking about the bad stuff, and the complicated, emotional stuff to deeply. It's a relaxing anime. And Ohta has that quality of being the nagging wife or presumably good in nature. It's worth a try if you want to find something to watch for relaxation, filling your lack of cuteness in your lives, some light hearted moment and stoic comedy etc.  
 
The artstyle and the background art really fit in perfectly to what the anime is aiming at when we, the audience is watching it. 
 
 
And obviously, this isn't a story aim to be the best anime out there. I mean we usually try to make out what makes an anime great based from the story progression of the story, the flow of the story, the dialogue, character development, intellectual/complicated plot development, being able to find other elements to forward the story in a unique ways, rational or badass MC and characters that makes a certain story great. But that isn't the case for an anime such as this. These kind of restriction kinda complicates the actuality of what makes a certain type of anime, story, movie or whatever great to certain individuals. That's why there are so many kind of these type of animes that are not aiming to be the best in the eyes of critics who wants to see something serious and profound, but to help the audience relax, enjoy the moe, and enlightening the meaning of happiness for many depressive men in Japan, or the stressful days we all have with reality.... ummmm i guess? I only watches this because the comedy is unique and new to having an MC that's listless. There're alot of female student selling themselves off, servicing men to walk with them, talk to them (old business, to young, or otakus), and so forth in Akihabara. And Otakus whose life are miserable and using anime as a pretext to live on with their unsatisfying life. But i'll end this conversation there, since it's kinda out of context. And yea.... Why the hell did i start talking about it.. Oh yea, these kind of animes, or story are popular in the anime community because sometimes we need something to alleviate the hates that we sees in the world, people, or community, or even family. And this anime kinda alleviate it in a more relaxing way. The kind of relaxing and cute that will makes you want to watch more of Tanaka-Kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge. 
 
Nevertheless, this anime is pretty great so far, the humor is cute, silly, refreshing and funny. The aesthetics of the anime was great. Character design are pretty interesting (except for Ohta, his appearance looks plain). It's for that interesting for me at the very least, but just check it out for a couple of episodes.

    At first glance Namu Amida Butsu!: Rendai Utena seems like your typical slice of life anime with hot guys going about doing whatever it is they’re doing. And you’re right. At its core, Namuami (which is what I’m calling it instead of the title name because that is too long) is a slice of life anime in a similar vein to Touken Ranbu Hanamura. The question is: is it good? I would say it’s a decent show if you go into it with low expectations. I liked it enough but if someone comes and says why they didn’t like it, I might agree with them even if I liked the show. 
 
Going into Namuami, I had low expectations for it not because I thought it would be bad (just average), and it’s a good thing I did that otherwise I would’ve been very disappointed.  
 
The complaints I have is that Namuami feels too stiff for a slice of life anime. There is a story revolving around Mara and the vices and while that’s fine and adds something to the show, the times when the Buddhas are living their day-to-day life, it feels very lacking. It does improve after episode 6 and things start to pick up and that stiffness goes away slightly. 
 
The characters themselves are a mixed bag. Only a handful are given and development and growth in all 12 episodes while some don’t get any or are just there for show. Some of them have little or no personality that makes them unique in their own way. For example, one of them is a protein loving exercise guy who is kind of clingy to his older brother and another one tells bad puns. Those are not personalities. Telling bad puns that aren’t even funny is not a personality trait. The few that do have personalities are decent characters. Especially with one of the characters. They’re not all bad but some are just boring and devoid of any personality. 
 
Finally, the conflict between Mara and the vices felt rushed. As quickly as it came, it was resolved quickly. It ends somewhat satisfying though it’s one of those ambiguous endings but I have a feeling that a 2nd season won’t be happening. 
 
While it may seem like don’t particularly like Namuami, I did enjoy my time watching it. Going into it with low expectations made me like the show more. Yes, it’s not perfect and some of the complaints are valid, but it’s not a bad anime in the slightest like some people say it is. It’s above average in presentation, characters, and plot but it’s not as bad. It won’t win any awards and it will probably be forgotten in a year or two, but at its heart, Namuami is a decent slice of life anime about the 13 Buddhas. If you do plan on watching it, I recommend going into it with little or no expectations, and if you liked Touken Ranbu Hanamura. Namuami may be average at best, but it’s still fun to watch.

    That ending kiled me ;-; 
 
This long-awaited (for me) second season was into so much doubt within the comunity because of the filler moments in the fisrt one. However, this demonstrated that A-1 Pictures can make good anime once in a while. 
 
As I haven't read any of the original light novel I'll be reviewing the series as it is by itself. A generic eviroment and setting with unique characters and weird but still natural development. 
 
In the first season I just watched it because I was going into harem stuff. But the fact that the main heroine was Megumi since ever made me think harem anime aren't all about a guy who bangs every girl with presence. 
 
The story itself wasn't all that original nor ordinary. A guy who recruits talented classmates who also are in love with him just don't happen in real life. But this is not the case with Megumi, who started as just a passerby. In the first season the team build their relationships. But in this second season we see each one developing as if every one of them was the main character. We see them joy and then suffer, also how they overcome the difficulties. And in the end, they make some big decissions that gets the anime upside down. Although, I'd really like to see a third season because a spoiler someone told me from the light novel ;-; 
 
The artstyle is just as generic as Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. But A-1 managed to add their little touch to some scenes, either making a shot with only one primal color, or just making fun of other works like the Monogatari Series. I found these eyecandy's quite enjoyable, and kept me from getting my eyes bored. 
 
The background music wasn't really memorable, but it makes the anime flow naturally and the tracks chosed for almost every type of moment (either dramatic or comedic) really fit there. The OP was good, but I think the animation for that, even if it seems made by freelancer animators, was beautiful. Specially when they changed an element depending on its state in the story. 
 
All the characters, except from Megumi and Akane, have a extremely generic surface. At the begining it was awful to see those stereotypes being reused once again, but then we fall back with they way they grow as individuals. I really like Megumi. She was weird in the first season, because of her forced lack of presence. But after the first season, her unnoticable personality came afloat. And everytime she appeared on screen, she seemed more open to others, and of course, to Tomoya. When I saw the last scenes of the last episode I really couldn't stop laughing. Megumi is my very favorite female character of this season. 
 
I give the anime an overall of 9 because some moments that felt off, some bad animated frames and the tipical A-1's bad 3D. But this is a really good anime that anyone can enjoy (if they watch the whole first season)

    ***A mostly spoiler free review*** 
 
I should not have finished this show. Week after week (save ONE episode which was decent) I sat through this show hoping and praying it would show me something...anything that resembled a decent watch. The show seemingly adds elements in only to waste them later on. 
 
Story: 1/10 
 
This is the first time that I have rated the story element so low. The show's pacing is so horrid that for some arcs they last multiple episodes with almost no progress while others are introduced and completed inside one episode. Also, please tell me there is more to this entire story than male MC hopefully getting it in his head that yes his stepsister also wants his genitalia?  
 
I understand that this is a trash romcom comedy (very light on the actual comedy) but there are so many shows that follow the same formula yet seem to have such amazing story elements. 
 
Art/Animation: 4/10 
 
To start off with; art. This show's artstyle is pretty meh. The characters look cute but their personalities and how they present themselves really ruin it. Also they (the studio) are sexualizing minors. Besides the male MC, all these MCs are under the age of 15. Idc where you are from that is some creepy shit. The show goes out of its way to place the camera in such dirty, awful spots even when it's a character alone on a phone. There is no comedic effect with that, it's just raw fanservice of a 12 year old. The coloring scheme is also really generic. Nothing stands out. This show looks like it was thrown together in an afternoon. 
 
The animation is so barebones. There are maybe 5 or so scenes where there is a framerate buff but other than that it is below the standard of what I would expect from a trashy romcom show. It's sad that when they (the studio) try to make a sexy shot of someone's boobs swaying look like a 2 drawing flip book. 
 
Sound: 3/10 
 
The VAs were decent. They sounded good and somehow got some personality across to their characters (but the lines were stale and not fitting). The music however is some of the worst I have ever heard. The music is trying so fucking hard to invoke an emotional response on the viewer since what is happening on screen is so meaningless. There are great soundtracks/scores that ever so slightly help what is going on screen (and these are the great ones). Then there are ones that put a little more work into directing (not forcing) the audience to feel more emotion. This can be an effective tool (like in Hans Zimmer films) but this show goes too far and has an awful effect on the experience since it is trying to do all the heavy lifting. 
 
Characters: 1/10 
 
Nothing. There was absolutely nothing I liked about the characters. The show doesn't help the characters spread their wings out either. Some characters (like dick girl and the bookstore attendant) just straight up disappear for multiple episodes. Was dick girl's only job to say weird, memy shit and have her panties taken off? I'm sorry but if you introduce an element (like say a character) they have to have a purpose. If that purpose is just to be a fanservice character, fuck you.  
 
There is very little meaningful character development in this anime. Poor komono girl gets told to fuck off then gets strung around. What's the point of actually finishing her confession arc to just have her stick around later being dragged around and played like a fool?  
 
Overall: 2.3/10 
 
I do not wish to offend anyone but my god please go watch...ANYTHING ELSE. There are so many more romcoms out there that do a much better job at making you interested in the show. If you want to watch this show due to the cuteness of the characters, just go watch clips of it on YouTube and/or look up gifs/screenshots online. You do not have to watch the show in order to get that enjoyment out of them. This show is one of the reasons that I am genuinely worried about anime. The fact that this show has such high ratings and retention in both the West and the East shows that the average watcher just doesn't care about well crafted works anymore. We will continue to get this half assed garbage and see less more fulfilling shows. Please if you can do not contribute to this trash. There are so many other shows/films that are more worth your time.

    Story: (8/10) 
- I can't exactly give it a 9 or a 10 despite how much I liked the story. For starters, the story isn't exactly deep. You can take the story at face value. What makes it deserve an 8 though? For starters, the dorama in this movie is REAL. It exceeded what the series even did in 2 hours of content. But enough about the dorama, WHAT ABOUT THE TANKS. The amount of absurd tank movements and tactics in this movie is cranked up to 11. And you thought the series had WTF tank tactics, wait till you get a load of the movie. Apparently tanks can now turn into roller coasters and make jumps that make monster truck somersaults look like child's play. I cried so hard from laughing. But despite the tactics, the action pack and the twists in the movie keeps me at the edge of my seat. There wasn't many dull moments in the movie. If I had to state any problems though, its that the start of the movie, your bombarded with an entire group of new characters. The pacing in the movie is so-so. You can easily keep up with the movie, the plot doesn't move too slowly, and most of the movie is dedicated to tank battles anyways 
 
Art: (9/10) 
- The animation remains consistent. There weren't any off-models as far as I saw, and the combination of 2D and the 2.5D animations really blends. The visual effects also remain consistent as from the series, so you can expect some eye catching visuals from the tanks and the girls 
 
Sound: (9/10) 
- As usual, the voice actresses/actors all did a wonderful job. But thats basically seconday. WHAT ABOUT THE TANKS AGAIN. The tanks all still have the sound effects from the series. Barely anything was changed. There was a lot more action in the movie, so its much appreciated that they did a good job with the tank explosions, tank sounds, and tank cannon blasts. 
 
Character: (8/10) 
- Just cuz its the tail end of the series doesn't mean there's no room for character development. Despite the shallow plot of the series, there was much room for character development in the series. We're shown a brand new side to each character, sides that we never saw before. 
 
Enjoyment: (9/10) 
- Putting aside the initial hype I had for this movie, the movie truly is enjoyable. It exceeded my expectations. The comedic tank tactics, the suddenly tanks can do better stealth than Big Boss, the explosions, the visual effects all make up a really exciting tank battle, and the dorama and interactions make the peaceful moments interesting. If you enjoyed the series, your going to enjoy this movie a lot 
 
Overall: (9/10) 
- The story isn't bad. The reasons for things to happen are simply because ""it happened"" is probably one of my problems with the story aside from the sudden bombardment of new characters. It seems vague cuz I did my best not to spoil any story elements as much as I could. But despite the shallow reasoning, the interactions and the ensuing reactions and dorama that follows more than make up for it.  The bigger involvement of characters that were underused in the series really made an impact for me. The tank battles were awesome though, no matter how impossible I think they are. Overall, it was a good watch, and if you enjoyed the series, you'll very well enjoy the movie

    Let me just say as a side note, the first thing I thought when scouting out tokyo ghoul a few weeks back was Another.(http://myanimelist.net/anime/11111/Another)  The eyepatch on Kaneki just reminded me of Misaka from Another.  I will say that I have not read the manga at all so this will be a strict review of the anime itself.  You won't see any complaints about arc switching or covering too few or too many chapters here.   
Sound - I liked it... 
Now, normally I don't like watching OPs or EDs of anime.  A lot of the time it spoils the mood with the unchanging song during the climax of the anime.  As such, I usually skip past the OP and start the next episode before the ED.  This was not the case with Tokyo Ghoul(sort of.)  From the very first episode I found that I immensely enjoyed listening to the OP.  With such a short anime (1-cour), the OP pretty much fit the mood for every episode.  But even with such an amazing OP, I did not enjoy the ED at all.  Even right now just after finishing the last episode I can hardly remember the beginning of the song simply because I barely listened to it.  As for the background music, to me, it's a matter of did it stand out, or did it blend nicely?  In Tokyo Ghoul, all I can really say is it blended in nicely.  I mean, it's background music.  I hear it, it fits the mood, and it changes. 
Story - Good enough 
After watching the opening of the first episode, I noticed Kaneki with white hair instead of black hair.  Hair changing in anime usually means  the character becomes a badass. As someone with absolutely no background knowledge, this was pretty much the one thing I was looking forward to in the beginning.  Thrust into the ghoul world pretty quickly, Kaneki struggles with the morality of eating people.  He is forced to live on the grey line that divides ghouls and humans.  The beginning of Tokyo Ghoul allowed the story to go in many places.  So, when the story slowly unraveled, it's safe to say I had higher hopes.  Still, throughout most of the anime, I was kept on my toes, waiting for the appearance of white-haired Kaneki.  Suffice it to say, I didn't want it to end at episode 12.  The story was good enough that I'll probably be reading the manga in the near future.(something I rarely do.) 
Character - ehh 
While the character development was quite good, each side character got a little mini-arc of their own, and then proceeded to scarcely show up for the rest of the anime.  When one such side character was brought back in the end for the climax, the only thing I could really think about was, this is really cheesy.  While I do realize there was only 12 episodes to work with, the amount of screen time each character got felt a little short.  Rize had one of the weirdest roles in the anime.  Trying to incorporate her into the anime was quite awkward at times.  The main problem with Tokyo Ghoul's characterization was simply because there were too many characters.  Many characters could've had a completely different personality and it wouldn't have affected the story at all.  They're pretty much there to fill up time and space.  I'm not talking about person 924 in the crowd on the streets, I'm talking about much of the ""police force.""  For example, one of the commanders just irrationally gives out orders and gets angry at pretty much everything.  He doesn't even need to be there and things would still work out.   Also, the whole police side of Tokyo Ghoul was really left untouched and had a lot of room to expand.  Mado is really the only ""policeman"" who actually has any decent character.  Still, the characterization wasn't bad and for the main characters, it was very good. 
Enjoyment - interesting 
As the anime was airing, I did in fact watch each episode the day it came out.  It was that good.  There are some memorable scenes that people poke fun at and the ending was a particularly powerful one, especially for an anime that's only 12 episodes.  If I had to rate this, which I do, I would give this a 9/10.  Don't ask me why, it's just an arbitrary number for MAL.

    Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is a fun little comedy that has a humor similar to Gintama.  
Story: 
It doesn't really have a story per se but a lot of the skits connect. The Skits that connect are, sort of, little stories. The one with the girl sitting by the river is the funniest though. 
Art: 
The art is pretty good, and really helps with the comedic effect. 
Sound: 
Although no tracks on the Soundtrack really caught my ear, they all help create the light-hearted feel of the show. 
Character: 
The characters all have their uses for the shows humor, although if your looking for deep characters, or characters with dark pasts, this show has none of that. 
Enjoyment: 
I Laughed a lot at most of the skits contained within the show. Some went over my head, but i'd say it's rather enjoyable overall. 
Overall: 
I would recommend this for a good laugh, and the humor is family friendly, so feel free to recommend it to friends.

    The driving force behind any action we take can be attributed to the profit as a result of said action. Whether that profit is tangible or intangible, our lives are loosely based on a ""avoid punishments and collect rewards"" mentality. Yet, it is strange. We sacrifice our health in order to acquire wealth only to spend that surplus to recuperate our well being. In that sense, it is seemingly irrational for us to work without pause in with the hope that our efforts will be handsomely rewarded. 
 
However, people continue to do so, sweating tears and blood in the process. Ookami to Koushinryou, also known as Spice and Wolf, explores this theme with a supernatural, medival, and romantical flair. Through the utilization of cleverly written dialogues and exchanges, a memorable cast of characters, and intriguing arcs, Spice and Wolf presents fundamental financial concepts and human relationships in a witty and interesting way. 
 
The premise of the show is built upon the relationship formed by chance between Kraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant, and Horo, a wolf deity who oversees the harvest. Under the agreement that Lawrence guides Horo to her homeland in the north, the two begin to travel together, creating fond memories, facing hardships, and of course, conducting business together. 
 
Many consider money and love as the two primary forces behind the demeanor of any person; the tangible and intangible reasons, if you will. It is unusual for these two forces to work together resulting in a ideal life for any person, and this is what Spice and Wolf primarily focuses on. Casting aside the aspects of the show that are based in fantasy, the conflict between the two is a very real struggle that Spice and Wolf explores. The relationship between Lawrence and Horo is far from ideal: it is tested in many ways, by adversaries that take many forms, and exhibits the fundamental concept of risk versus reward. It has been said that there can be only one great love in your life. The question is, is it the prospect of great fortune and the happiness that comes with it, or the fortune of a person that cannot be bought at any price? Spice and Wolf presents both sides of that coin. 
 
Spice and Wolf's strength lies in the personality of the characters and the discussions about life, love, and profit between them. The merchants who act based on logical thinking and appraisal of facts; Spice and Wolf takes us into their world and shows us how a bit of cleverness and wit can go very far, and how any lack of information or foresight can cost someone more then they could ever imagine.  
 
Lawrence and Horo make for an interesting combination to watch. On one hand, you have your wily traveling merchant who is a respectable man in his field and gets by making profit through calculations and predictions, and on the other, we have a wise wolf who has seen many a years pass and many a person met who is an expert at manipulating emotions and expectations. This duo, as expected, are able to use their talents to make a greater profit than your run of the mill peddler. However, as intelligent and cunning as they are, they are not perfect, and run into their fair share of troubles, and makes it that more interesting to watch. There is a lot to be said about a romantical relationship between a man and a deity; however their relationship does not follow the natural paradigm of such a situation. It is surprisingly ordinary, as each try to deal with their feelings for the other, and how they express their affections and emotions concerning the other.  
 
The art is tastefully done and with accordance to the time period. From the well drawn towns that the two visit, to the scenery in the background while they are traveling; everything serves to enhance the atmosphere of a true adventure and the concept of traveling freely. The music is appropriate; ranging from lively violin pieces to somber folk songs, the tune more often than not fits the mood very nicely. Whether it's a relaxing scene in a pub where Horo and Lawrence are sharing a drink in high spirits, or it's a high tension situation between merchants, the music accompanies the scene appropriately. 
 
Spice and Wolf weaves a tale of finance with hints of fantasy and romance in a endearing and intelligent way. For those who like a show to be stimulating, witty, and emotional, Spice and Wolf is an excellent choice.

    Shin-Chan is a strange anime. It doesn't look like one, and when you do look at it you think of it as a kiddish anime when really, its more for teens.  
 
The story however put a smile on my face. I love these kinds of shows that just follow the lives of their characters. We follow the life of Shin-Chan, his mom, his dad and his baby sister as well as his friends and teachers from school. The adventures these characters get into range from buying eggs at the super market to exploring the forest for turtle man. No matter how zanny it may seem you get the feeling that its just all about growing up for this kid. He has a pretty big imagination and the creators take full advantage.  
 
Even though I found some of the story lines a little too perverted and the animation is pretty ugly, there is something about Shin-Chan that brings out the child in you. He disobeys his parents, he goes to school, he uses his child imagination to create wild and crazy stories that are different from the everyday life of him going to school etc. Because sometimes, just like Shin-Chan real life can be boring sometimes.  
 
Take care everyone.

    Having written a short review on Mushishi with vague statements (it's in the first season of Mushishi), I feel like writing a full fledged analytical (self proclaimed :v ) review on the series as well. I'm not giving a spoiler warning because it's not really possible to spoil Mushishi like that. But, this review will contain plot points from within the series. So it's better if you've already watched it. This will take a really long time. Alright, let's get to the point. 
 
What is mushi? To put it simply, they are the most primitive lifeforms. They're unlike any flora or fauna we're familiar with. But, they're not creatures from outside this world, rather they are the basic living beings. These entities are the closest to life itself. To be more precise, they derive directly from the essence of life, known as kouki. I'll give an idea of what 'kouki' is a bit later. 
But before that, let's take a moment to think about how brilliant the very idea of such existence is. I don't know about others, but this elegant idea produces deep respect for the series in me. 
That alone wouldn't amount to much if it wasn't deeply thought out. 
'Kouki' is the essence of life. It can be said that kouki is life itself. Don't make mistake, life is different from physical organ. Organs and organisms are made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, while Kouki consists of rain/water and sunlight. I found this to be a metaphor. Most of us probably know that water as well as light are called life. This anime literally uses them as the source of life. The form of kouki is quite vague. It's mostly shown in a liquid form. This semi-physical substance is what provides life energy to the living beings. And mushi are the beings that originate directly from kouki, thus they're closest to life. As a result, they're also vague in existence and don't have particular physical distinction to categorize them. Thus, there isn't any particular taxonomy for these beings. But, as we can see in the anime, there are researches constantly being done as well as a collection of data on them. 
The concept of mushi is also explained through comparing them with other organisms. To put simply, the more primate the creatures are, the further they are from life. As mushi's existence is vague, people are divided into those who can see them and those who can't. The people who deals with mushi related incidents are called mushi-shi. 
There are more elements that the anime deals with, like koumiyaksu, second eyelids, mountain lords, etc. All these are explained in a very wonderful and attractive way. The explanation never created any hindrance to the story. It naturally comes off as a part of the story. 
Japan is a country with rich and interesting culture, traditions, etc. Japanese folklore is considerably vast. Mushi-shi explores these folk cultures, folk tales, traditions, etc through the concept of mushi and also explains them with it. That's something I would like to call 'theme/source rewrite'. I dunno if there's a specific name for this type of buildup since you can't look them up just that simply. Anyway, Mushishi does this job very well. I found almost every episode to have a theme from Japanese folk tales and traditions, and in each of them, Mushishi rebuilt those elements through the concept of mushi. 
This anime uses scientific ideas to solve many problems and explain many incidents, which I found to be quite amusing. 
Fantasy series tend to have very sloppy writing because of its fantasy genre. But, as we can see from the points above, Mushishi is not one of them. It is intelligently thought out. It is well rounded, well fleshed out and quite plausible. 
Mushishi presents the connection between man and nature. The message it carries is ""Cure lies in the curse"". Snake's venom is used for making its antidote. Extermination of snakes is uncalled for. This point has been addressed multiple times in Mushishi. The mushi interact with people in different ways. Sometimes they bring happiness. And sometimes they bring sufferings and sorrows. But, it's not their fault. They're just living their lives. This is a very valuable message this anime delivers. 
This is, of course not the only message provided by the anime. There are life lessons hidden in every episode. 
When a fiction works with so many themes, there's always a chance for loose ends, improperly tied plot points or untied points (Hunter x Hunter 2011). And even if it does tie them up, they may seem too sloppy, desperate and/or implausible (To Aru Majutsu no Index), in fact, may totally fail. Mushishi is something that doesn't fall into these inconsistencies. The elements are well connected and very well executed. The themes it works on are coherent. 
 
Before going for flaws, I'd like to inform/remind you that there are two basic types of flaws. Flaws that matter, and those that don't. Amongst those that do matter, there are major ones and minor ones. Having that cleared, let's shed lights on some points that seem like shortcomings. 
 
Firstly, there are, albeit very few, cases when the mushi related incidents are not explained as much as the others. Due to this, those occurrences seem a bit awkwardly unbelievable. Make no mistake. They do explain them, but it just that the explanations are a bit weak compared to others. This is a very minor drawback, which might not even appear to all. 
Next, we have a common complaint. Not explaining why Ginko is the only one seen in Western dress. Also, how there are modern instruments. The era of this anime is never really explained in the anime. But, iirc, it's set in an imaginary era. Well, as a fiction, we can allow a bit different world. So, yes, we can leave this issue as a part of its world building. 
Another issue I found is that it never explained why some people attract mushi so much. It's an issue that doesn't matter much, because it could be considered a random occurrence. It doesn't need explanation. 
 
An irrelevant side note: If you're thinking ""what? This guy just gave a little solution for the problems too. What a fanboy!"",then I'd say that I'm not audacious enough to dig deep to find problems but not do it for finding solutions. And yes, the fact that I'm a Mushishi fanboy also contributes. 
 
Well, one might complain that the history of mushi's arrival is avoided using 'time immemorial' excuse, but that would be a retarded complaint. Mushi are the closest beings to life, so their appearance could very well be older than us humans. 
That being said, this anime doesn't completely avoid history. There are old incidents and they're adequately explained. The world it built up is unique. The existence of the mushi has been effective on its world. We have people who makes a living dealing with them. They are mushi-shi. There are people who uses mushi in different ways. There are people who does business with mushi related objects. Some like to collect these things. The group of mushi-shi isn't monolithic. They have different points of view, mindsets and different ways to deal with mushi. That's what makes it more interesting. There is a place where many mushi related matters are recorded. There are stuffs about clans and all. 
 
Mushi don't only have these long term influences, they also have short term effects on different spheres of people's lives. Through these small effects, these small points are also addressed. We get a peek into the characters' lives. That is what the stories of this anime are about. The lives of the characters. 
 
Mushishi is an episodic show, meaning that a story is told in one episode each time and there isn't any particular connection between the episodes. So, if you're expecting an overarching and highly progressing plot in its story, this is not what you are looking for right now. But, if you wanna take a break from your daily action series, have a different experience, or simply relax, then Mushishi is something to look forward to. And as a person, that is highly likely to happen one time or another. This anime usually takes place in a village, or a town, or a mountain, forest, seacoast, or in the sea and sometimes even on the road. These handful of types of places contain the stories. So, each type of places are used multiple times in the anime. But, they aren't identical to each other. Each place is different from the other, even if a little. Which shows us how it's not written by a lazy person, but rather someone who puts some thoughts on what she works on. 
 
Due to its episodic nature, one might presume that all the episodes follow a single pattern. But, that isn't the case. Each episode is unique and different from each other. They don't follow any specific pattern or formula, so it's not repetitive. Thus, they're each a different experience and that makes it really interesting. Through its 46 episodes and 3 specials, it delivers 49 stories that are different from each other and interesting in their own ways. 
The stories are written wonderfully. There is no info dump to interfere and cause hindrances to the storyline. I've previously said that the stories don't have highly progressing plot, but that doesn't mean that the plot is stagnant. There is progression even if a little in almost all the episodes and that is more than enough for an episodic anime. 
This anime has a great balance of dialogues and actions. It knows when enough has been told and where to start showing, and vice versa. The transition from dialogues to action or action to dialogues, and sometimes the coexistence of both is masterfully handled. 
Another aspect that makes it well written is that this anime doesn't come up with retarded, baseless incidents to create climax or tension. Rather it's well thought out and reasonable at coming up with a climatic situation. The solution is also equally intelligent. That's what makes its stories excellently thought out. 
This anime doesn't resort to convenient storytelling. No sloppy writing. 
If you put each of its stories in a nutshell, some of them might not stand out as a masterpiece, but most of them will. More like almost all of them. It has some extremely high quality stories that can rival the best of the bests. They are top tier masterpiece stories. This anime is really comprised of compelling stories. 
But, what makes every episode of it a masterpiece is the excellent presentation and the narration. it gives us a feeling of listening to folktales told by Grandma in a small house in a rural area. It's a precious experience. And Mushishi thrives with this specialty. 
Mushishi's atmosphere is strong and impacting. It relays its atmosphere perfectly. You could really feel cold in winter and hot when it's hot summer in the anime. The suspense absorbs the viewers deeply. 
The ending of every episode is excellent. Most of them are bittersweet. Some endings are the bests I've seen in anime. They sometimes show you hopes that in the future, the characters may be happy. Sometimes they imply that they may not. Some says that there is no other choice. Each endings are unique. Nuff said. 
Mushishi's pacing in every episode is perfect and extremely coherent to the story telling method. 
Mushishi has some very well written twists and revelations. They're not well written in the way that 'it provides all the clues but you won't predict them before revealing'. No, Mushishi is not like that. You actually don't know anything before they tell you and you don't have any clue to the twist. But, when it's delivered, you will think, ""Oh so that's how it's done!"" Usually, the definition of a good twist or revelation to me is that it provides all clues but you still won't be able to predict it before it shows the twist/revelation. Mushishi is probably the one of the rarest fiction that excels in this aspect without following the definition. 
All these make Mushishi one of the best episodic experience, if not the best. 
 
As a show where the story begins, progresses and ends in a single episode, almost all the side don't appear in multiple episodes. This leaves a risk of not having properly fleshed out characters. There are risks of not having a cast to care about. But, in all honesty, Mushishi didn't fail at fleshing the characters out. And in each episode, you will root for the characters. At least I did. All the significant characters had proper amount of traits. This is an anime about normal people and Mushishi perfectly pulled that out. As someone who lived in a village, I could relate to them and share their feelings. That's the most important thing in Mushishi. The difference between each character is small but realistic and adequate. 
The main character of this anime is a mushi-shi named Ginko. It follows his adventure as a mushi-shi. He goes around helping people with different mushi related matters. But, that doesn't mean that he's just a tool for the adventure. His past is well explored. His characteristic is fleshed out. He doesn't like to kill those that are alive. But, it doesn't mean that he won't do it if it's necessary. He would stain his hands to solve problems if the situation requires it. He wouldn't want to do so at first, but he still convince himself to do what's necessary. Here's a conversation from the anime that shows his resolve- 
 
Mushi: Why are you going to kill us? 
Ginko: Because you consume human children. 
Mushi: But it's not our fault. 
Ginko: It's not our fault either. But we're stronger. So you will die along with your seed. 
 
Then he destroys all mushi. Just kidding. But, yes. He's not your goody justice guy either. He'd do what needs to be done. But, he would definitely not resort to killing if there's any other way. Ginko has other flaws as well. He can make mistakes, he acts on instant impulses. He gets annoyed at others. Furthermore, he's much more human than one would expect. His character development is also well done. 
Not just Ginko, but all the mushi-shi have different and interesting personalities. Thus, the group of mushi-shi is not monolithic. 
Despite the short span, the characters in Mushishi is delivered wonderfully. Their wishes, goals, point of view, all these have been well executed. Some of them even develop in this short period and the development is really natural. 
 
Let's have a look at the visuals. Mushi are designed excellently, with superfluous details. The animation work on the mushi is carefully done, which makes them come to life. The art style used for designing the characters is artistic, realistic and lovable. The character design for most side characters in Mushi-shi is actually quite similar, but they're never identical. Although little, there are differences in the design of each characters. That much difference is adequate in my opinion because you can't expect all the village people to be totally different from each other. The main character, Ginko is excellently designed as well. 
The anime is not a piece of art, rather a huge collection of tremendous amount of art pieces. It feels like it uses moving artworks as its background. Each frame is a beautiful piece of art. The effects are masterfully used and colors are wisely chosen. The animation makes these amazing sceneries lively. The slow and subtle animation deepens the tone of the moments and gets us completely absorbed into the scenario. 
The art of the characters and the environment are a bit different in quality, but they blend in wonderfully. 
This is accompanied by excellent background music played by Masuda Toshio, which blend in perfectly with the atmosphere, intensify the moods and move us subconsciously with their captivating rhythms. They don't distract the viewers, but rather engage them more into the anime. Both of the opening songs are extremely refreshing and enjoyable. Just listening to them removes your weariness. The ending themes are different for each episode with different sceneries presented with them. They are relaxing and possessive. The voice acting is realistic and amusing. The narration is excellent. The sounds that the mushi make, along with the visuals are ecstatically wonderful. The environmental sounds are equally compelling. The natural sounds alone can form the sceneries. The screenplay and audio are carefully measured and synched. This anime has one of the best production job ever. 
 
All these make Mushishi one of the most relaxing and refreshing experience, if not the most. It was intriguing, at times enticing, sometimes funny. Then at times depressing or melancholic. But, even in the presence of all these emotions, one feeling is always there. It is a deep, absorbing, overwhelming feeling, which in one word, is 'awe'. A feeling of respect combined with wonder. It's atmosphere is perfectly relayed. It's aesthetics caused me euphoria. It provided me with many forms of enjoyment mixed up magnificently. 
 
Now, let's see what Mushishi tries to do. To be frank, it's quite difficult to ascertain what it aims for. Not because it has no goal, but because it's so naturally presented that it never seemed to be desperate to achieve anything. 
But, one thing is for sure. It doesn't aim for your cheesy and shallow entertainment with brain dead humor. It doesn't aim for an attractive shonen battle. What it tries to do is to deliver a genuinely well written, well executed mature experience. And it succeeds greatly. 
It tries to be a soothing experience and turns out to be the most soothing anime. 
It's tries to deliver its message wrapped up with an excellently fleshed out elements. And we get from it elements that are some of the bests of fantasy. 
It tries to cover rural people's lives, Japanese folklores, connection between man and nature with its elements. It does the job as good as possible. 
Despite all the details and depth, Mushishi manages to be a simple show, which is another one of its achievements. It is in no way pretentious. It's an elegant form of art and pure with its context. 
 
It's an unique experience. Mushishi couldn't have been better. As far as perfection goes, this is as close as it gets. 9.7/10. I just love this show.

    You know that feeling of total shock and awe that you get after finishing a really good show or movie? Where you just sit there staring at the screen, unable to process the sheer awesomeness of what you just saw? Imagine that feeling, but ten times stronger, and you might get a taste of what I felt while watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Every time I finish that final episode, I get this euphoric feeling that lasts for several hours on end, often keeping me up the entire night on pure adrenaline. There isn’t a single day that goes by where I don’t have flashbacks to certain scenes from the show and start getting the chills all over again. Yes, it’s that good. 
 
STORY - 9.9/10 
 
One of the most common misconceptions of Gurren Lagann I hear is that it’s a simple, mindless show that’s all about over the top fight scenes and cheesy inspirational speeches. And while the show has plenty of those, it has way more than just adrenaline rushes to offer. The story is very well written, following several intertwined character arcs and thematic ideas that all spiral around a very deep and thought provoking central message. The attention to detail is ridiculous, with extended metaphors that can be applied to almost every aspect of the show. On top of that, there are several plot twists and surprises to keep the viewer engaged. The only issue I might have with the story is with a couple episodes near the beginning, which I feel are weaker than the rest of the show, but the last few episodes more than make up for it with my favorite ending of all time. 
 
CHARACTERS - 9.8/10 
 
The major characters of this show are brilliantly written. Kamina’s bold relentless attitude has its own charm, and Simon “the Digger” has one of the best character arcs I’ve seen in any form of media. Other characters like Yoko, Viral, Rossiu, and Lordgenome all have their own traits and well written arcs throughout the series. While their world is very different from ours, the characters feel very real and relatable through their growth. And of course, the villains are also great, with justified and believable motivations that serve as a near perfect contrast to our protagonists. The only thing I'd knock is that some of the minor supporting characters feel incredibly one-dimensional, but they play a very insignificant role in comparison to the fully fleshed out main cast. 
 
ART - 9.7/10 
 
The visuals are animation are outstanding in this show, especially when considering that it was made in 2007. The fights are beautifully choreographed and visually appealing with vivid color palettes. The cinematography is some of the best I’ve seen in anime. And there’s plenty of visual symbolism that adds meaning to the story and characters. The art is especially good in the final few episodes, which the creators saved 40% of their budget for. And it shows; those final episodes are some of the most beautiful episodes I’ve ever seen. That final fight, oh my god. 
 
SOUND - 9.7/10 
 
The show is just as amazing in the audio department. The voice acting is powerful for both the sub and dub versions. In fact, it has one of the best dubs I’ve heard, right alongside Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. But where the sound truly stands out is in the music. There’s a large variety of soundtracks that perfectly capture every scene, whether they’re happy, sad, spine-chilling, or pure hype moments. One track in particular, titled “Libera Me From Hell”, is the most unique and symbolic soundtrack I’ve ever heard. It plays during some of the best scenes in the entire show, and it makes those scenes that much better. 
 
OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9.9/10 
 
Yeah, as you can probably tell by now, I love this show. It’s my favorite piece of fiction across all types of media and storytelling, and I’ve had more fun watching it than anything else. Hell, those last few episodes are probably in the top ten best experiences of my life. The show’s messages have genuinely made a positive impact on my life and how I view the world. And while I don’t expect everyone to enjoy it as much as I do, I think anyone would be doing themselves a huge favor by watching it. So what are you waiting for? Open a new window and experience one of the most epic shows anime has to offer.

    Love is an act of will, an emotion that can usher individuals to take monumental, illogical actions; be it sacrificing yourself for the person you long for, or the endless chase after your beloved one. In the case of Sennen Joyuu, or Millenium Actress, it made shape the life of a young girl in her quest to find the love of her life. It is a fantastic journey with a fascinating approach in the narrative of the story. 
 
Genya Tachibana reaches out to the enigmatic idol of his youth, Chiyoko Fujiwara, leading actress for nearly three decades, to make a documentary of her. This may seem as something simple at first glance, yet the approach it took on the narrative was truly captivating: both Genya and his companion find themselves spiraling through the life of Chiyoko as she reminisces about her past, blending in with her memories as well as the reality.  
 
The way this was portrayed was very fitting for the story, jumping from one scene to another from the actress's different movies she acted in. These transitions were very smooth, with each scene portraying a distinct reality. The interactions with characters twists the reality, where Genya plays an active role in the movies with the actress. These situations often managed to crack a smile of my face, as viewers could really understand their devotion and how the characters felt, in addition to being quite amusing as well. 
 
The reason on why Chiyoko became an actress in the first place seemed rather weak and not plausible, having only spend a few hours as a child with a man she didn't know anything of - which will probably be what most viewers think at first. While this is certainly a debatable topic, first love can induce people to do reckless things. What however is of importance here, are the events in her life that happen afterwards, in which the anime explores the loss of innocence and youth. In addition, these events are surprisingly realistic, and relatable to the viewer. 
 
The cast of characters in Millenium Actress played an important role to the overall narrative of the story. First of all, the devotion of Chiyoko to the mysterious man seems rather far-fetched, yet as the story progresses, audiences observe how she ages and struggles with finding that man. It is remarkable how she ultimately confesses in enjoying the chase after said individual, rather than meeting him. As a character as a whole she was rather uninteresting, which was nevertheless compensated with her ""journey"". 
 
The man itself remains a mystery throughout the whole duration of the movie, which from a point of narrative and story is a positive thing. This nevertheless makes it hard for the viewer to understand Chiyoko's devotion to him, as no information is given at all, which can be a drawback for some audiences. 
 
What however struck me as the most interesting character was Genya; he is introduced at first as a simple filmmaker, yet as the story unravels, his past and motives becomes clear, which were introduced subtly, besides of working as an anchor for the viewers to follow the story and be able to distinguish between reality and mere memories. His dedication on why he revers Chiyoko remains however a mystery. 
 
The animation of Millenium Actress was well done, fluid in motions and transitions in scenes: after all, the viewers were shown differnt scenes from the movies the actress played in, which blended well with the narrative of the story. Backgrounds and characters were compelling to look at, audiences recognizing the typical designs of Satoshi Kon's characters. The soundtrack used was overall not that impressive, though certain themes were wonderful to hear. 
 
Overall Millenium Actress was a very enjoyable anime with a fascinating approach on the narrative, which blended reality and memories. The motives of the characters may seem rather lackluster in comparison, yet the fleshing out of those was certainly well done. I would personally recommend this movie to anyone, as it shows the viewer that the chase after something can be an interesting journey full of twists and turns - or rather, life itself. 
 
Thank you for reading.

    NOTE: I apologize ahead of time for a rather lengthy and what’ll seem dragged on review, this is a show that holds a special place in my heart -gets teary- So I wouldn't feel right leaving anything that I feel is important out of this review. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 
 
 
Introduction:  
“Don’t judge a book by the cover.” This is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about the show that is Yu Yu Hakusho, given it’s not actually a book but an anime adaptation of a manga, baka, of course I know this much. It appears to be another one of those scream-as-loud-as-you-can-to-power-up-and-protect-your-friends, kind of show, which seemed to be riddled throughout the anime industry in the early and late 90s. Sure the show has it’s cliché moments but I would argue they are ingeniously portrayed in an enjoyable manner that is for the most part unpredictable and interesting. The mangaka of Yu Yu Hakusho is Yoshihiro Togashi who you might know as the creator of the hit series Hunter x Hunter (Fun fact: Togashi is married to Naoko Takeuchi, the author of Sailor Moon.) - Togashi is exceptional at creating characters with depth, and putting these characters in various psychological struggles both internally and externally to strengthen their growth and development. This is what makes Yu Yu Hakusho stand out so much, it’s characterization. Now, with the introduction out of the way let’s power up and start! “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH” 
 
Story. 9/10 
The show tells the story of Yusuke Urameshi a 14 year-old delinquent that is always itching for a fight, he refuses to attend classes regularly and enjoys fighting fellow delinquents in his city, not the most charming guy, right? Well he’s our protagonist, and pseudo-spoiler-alert he dies in the first, wait for it… 25 seconds of the show. He amazingly enough jumps in front of a car to save a child who was chasing after a ball. No one could have guessed Yusuke, of all people would sacrifice his life for another. Hell, even the head honchos at Spirit World wouldn’t of imagined he would perform such a selfless act, thus his adventure begins with his death. 
Yusuke’s death was an unpredicted one and well he has no place to go. There’s no place for him in the afterlife, they at Spirit World, did not know he would die on that day by saving someone’s life at the cost of his own. Therefore, Koenma, the son of King Yama, decides to put Yusuke to a test, an ordeal to see if he deserves to come back to life. So with this Yusuke’s first unofficial mission begins, the mission of resurrecting himself, little does he know on completion of this mission he will become Spirit Detective of earth; and must now protect all of humanity from aberrations with the help of his assistant Botan, the blue haired grim reaper, Kuwabara, Yusuke’s classmate and arch rival, Kurama the intelligent former demon fox, and lastly Hiei the demon swordsman with a bitter attitude. Together they are earths ragtag team of defenders.  
The premise of this show is an interesting one, it grabs your attention with the very unique cases *jobs* Yusuke is given as a Spirit Detective. The story at times can be rather dark, and does a very good job at pointing out the underbelly of society and meshes it with the story in a way you wouldn't feel preachy, it’s very crafty with this. Overtime we see the story progresses from the simpler cases to more life threatening and consequential ones that affect things on a larger scale which brings the intensity up! 
 
Animation. 9/10 
First off, the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaption was done by Studio Pierrot, who is also responsible for the anime adaptations: Naruto, Bleach and GTO (Great Teacher Onizuka) So it’s blatantly obvious this studio is more than credible with their animation skills. Yu Yu Hakusho aired in 1992 (Fun fact: The user Cloud_Silvers as also born in 1992) and at the time the animation was very fitting and very well done as was the fluidity in the action sequences, given at times the colors can be a bit crude. I believe the show’s visual can hold up today pretty well seeing how it originally aired 22 years ago, I bet you feel old... As we progress with the story and things become gradually more serious we see the art style losing some of it’s softness and in turn becomes a lot more detailed and mature which can be interrupted as a tool to symbolize the story and characters growths over time. 
 
I tend not to be overly critical with animation especially anime from the 90s but for the time this was done it was done very well. The protagonists all have a unique enough styles that they’re very memorable and same goes with the antagonist, you won’t see an actual character in this show that doesn’t have a creative design, one that will burn into your brain, like a tattoo.(Fun fact: I have no tattoos.) 
 
Sounds. 9/10 
 
Now the soundtrack. Oh boy, does this show have one, a good one at that. The show’s soundtrack is a very memorable one because it does an amazing job at setting the mood for the show. The pieces are very 90s and kick-ass the perfect mixture for a fighting shounen. You can really tell a lot of care was put in the soundtrack because you being to feel the emotions when a certain track comes on and makes the experience all the more enjoyable. 
 
Listening to the soundtrack you can feel a sense of urgency, emotions both sad and happy, you can feel the pain and anger all this is done with the genius music. Overall beautiful pieces composed by Yusuke Honma (Wow his name seems familiar, I swear I've seen it somewhere -whistles-) The soundtrack is beautiful, appropriate and is truly a labor of love. 
 
Characters. 10/10 
 
Yu Yu Hakusho’s characters are very diverse and complex. Watching the show we get to experience this adventure with them as they grow, mature, learn new perspectives and change their outlooks on life itself. The best part of the characters is that they are so human and relatable. You gradually come to understand every character, and their ideals, mindsets and feelings. You get emotionally attached to each character and even the villains you come to sympathize with as you found out their backstories. I rarely watch a show where I literally shed tears for a villain's demise. These villains all have their various reasons and they may be wrong but they're just trying to achieve their own respected goals and the show does a good job at making this apparent. They are not villains for the sake of being villains. 
 
Enjoyment.10/10 
 
Lastly the enjoyment factor… I love this show wholeheartedly, it’s one of my first anime I ever watched when I was younger. It was not until I was older and re-watched it could I truly appreciate this anime for what it was. A battle shounen with an amazing cast of characters, interesting storylines, and fantastic villains. This show is special to me not because of nostalgia reasons but because I’ve watched it over 6 times and still find myself not getting bored. There’s a lot to it, more than you would really think. I would say it’s arguably one of the most enjoyable long-shounens. 
 
Overall: 10/10 
Yu Yu Hakusho does a superb job of creating these totally human characters both good and bad. We get to see them in a state we can understand and this makes it all the more enjoyable when seeing them mature or learning about their back-stories. Again, this show will at times make you sincerely feel sorry for the antagonists because of the complexity and human nature they put into them. Out of them all Yusuke our protagonist is the one who we see “grow up” the most, from a quick-to-throw-a-punch-cocky teenager to a dependable man who can both protect and cherish his friends and loved ones which is the opposite of how he started off. I fell in love with the characters and I truly cared for them, I cried with them and I smiled with them, I was on this adventure with them and for that I thank you Yu Yu Hakusho. This show is great for both young adults and more mature audiences.

Story: 6 
 
The story of Guilty Crown is nothing new,it's a revolution with mechas and our main character has got a superpower in a post-apocalyptic Japan.This future is consecuence of an incident with a mortal illness. 
The story is interesting,even though,it's another Code Geass or an attempt of Evangelion 
The revolution is promoted by a terrorist group called ""undertakers"",our main character,one day walks from school going to his favorite place and he finds the singer of his favorite group ""Egoist"" and he gets a superpower,because of that,he end in a battle with those terrorists and later on joing to them. 
The main problem of Guilty Crown is how they continue the story,it's rushed as fuck.The end is very very rushed and throws everything away making everything fast,anti-climatic and kind of shit. 
The story has a plot twist at the middle of the story which changes the way that he works. 
So in a summary ,the story is interesting,even though is a copypaste of Code Geass,Evangelion,Gundam.The problem is the way that it develops and that's very rushed.Anyway it's pretty decent and the cristal thing because of the illness gives it a plus in originality,and another good point is that the figth is humans against mechas and that's origianl as well,so the story sounds attractive and it has got great points but as it progresses,it breaks into pieces. 
 
 
Art and animation: 10 
 
The art and animation is gorgeous,flawless,amazing and I could takl hours about how good it looks,it came form Production IG known FOR Ghost in the Shell or Eden of the east.The backgrounds are very detail and helps you to ""enter"" in the story ,the animation is fluid,the mechas and the character desings are breath-taking and the cristal thing makes it more beautiful.Without any doubt the animation is one of the sell point of the show and it's done fantastic,the director is known form other works like Death Nore or Shingeki no Kyojin,so the  action scenes are very well made and very exciting. 
 
Sound: 9 
The ost is brilliant,made by Sawano,known for antoher glorious ost like Shingeki no Kyojin or Kill la Kil,the conmbation with the well made action scenes makes very of these scene epic. 
Also,the anime is focus on music and the songs which Inori sings are great. 
Without a doubt,the ost is great and deserves congratulations everywhere. 
In addition,the openings are freaking awsome and the endings as well. 
 
Characters: 3 
 This is the weakest point of Guilty Crown,the characters are a lot but the majority hasn't got enough screen time to even connect with them,those who has got screen time are plain and doesn't develop at all,not all of them,of course but a great majority. 
 
Ouma Shu: Another Shinji Ikari.He's the main character who starts being an afraid kid with anmesia about this past.His father is dead and his mom is never at home,so someone with a soap full od topics and clichés gave Shu a bath.To be fair,he actually develops thorugh the serie,but it makes it worse,because it became the ""tiranic emo"" without knowing what the hell do,he changes again at the end,and his end actually pleased me. 
 
Inori: The ""doll girl"",like Rei Ayanami (Evangelion) or Yuki Nagato (The melancholy of Haruhi),she is plain,and doesn't develop through the serie.She kind of have a romance with the main character which feels forced because they could literally be sitting one next to other hours without saying anyword,the chemistry is zero and they're both boring characters,actually,but they look cute together,so...She is the co-protagonist and it's really relevant to the story but she's a boring character. 
 
Tsutsugami Gai: He's what Shu wants to be,he is the leader of ""undertakers"".I liked him actually,he's connected with the protagonist and the villain somehow and his motivations at first,are done okay,even though,his final aim at the end is retrarded,he's not a bad character at the end of the day. 
 
Mana Ouma:The main villian,she's an incestous yandere whose screen times are very rushed and kind of put glue to fix a big hole. 
 
Yahiro: Shu's friend,well his relationship it's kind of complicated.He's the most likeable than the main character and you actually wish that he was the protagonist,he has got motivation and personality,and he can make decisions,so learn a bit,Shu. 
 
The rest of the cast it's completed by the goverment members,Shu's schoolmates and the rest of terrorists,which are unidimesional and plain. 
 
Enjoyment:5 
Although of all I write before,I enjoyed Guily Crown,it's fulled of plot holes and what it tries to be it's already done and done it better,but at the end it has got very enjoyable parts to look back and remember them with a feeling of sattisfaction,It's not the best like some praised to be but it's not so bad,it can be enjoyed and you might like more than I did. 
What I dislike the most i'ts how they continue the story after a plot twist in the middle,but at the end of the day It's an average serie that can entretain you for a while and has got an amazing animation and a great ost. 
 
Overall: 5 
 
For similar anime,check out:Code Geass,Neon Genesis Evangelion 
May find something of your liking between those. 
 
That's all folks.

A 6 episode serie would have been better (packed with a first 6 episode serie from season 1). I liked the animation, the action scenes and the character design. If not amazing and out of the box, I think you'll have a nice time. 
 
It’s very hard to connect with the main characters as well as their goals. Though you’ll probably find other characters to side with as some of them have great engaging value. My favorite is Rider because he contrasts nicely with the others. 
 
Beware of the lack of originality. That’s the typical hero/drama/I-have-a-big-mansion/talk-too-much/you-know-the-end story, so don’t expect great character developments. But overall, you won't be wasting your time.

    This is a weird one. At its best, this series has moments that I feel would place it above most of the 8's on my list. However, the overall series in terms of characters, plot, and general quality would constitute a 7 or even a 6 by my standards.  
 
Let's start with the good. The romantic leads in Sakuta and Mai are resonant of the ""good"" characters in many similar light-novel-adaptation-teen-rom-com-dramas. They have a few things going for themselves, but the real draw is their chemistry and honestly well-written dialogue. This was the main reason I gave this series a chance in the first place. Their dialogue really delivered for me in presenting a realistic and desirable relationship that got me emotionally invested and provided legitimately funny moments along the way. Many relationships in this genre rely entirely on the 'boy saves girl so girl falls in love' trope and while this series does have that element, we also get to see how the characters are legitimately compatible through both their witty dialogue and heartfelt conversations. Overall, the main duo were a joy to watch together and their scenes (especially early on) could be considered stand-out examples about what is interesting and enjoyable about this genre. I also appreciated the general tone of the series. It never resorted to overt wackiness or 'lolsorandom' humor and instead embraced a fairly deadpan vibe for its humor. This allowed for the melodrama to feel more tonally consistent compared to similar shows where the melodrama and wacky antics just clash too harshly to even feel like they're occurring in the same universe.  
 
Now for the bad. The plot presents almost nothing new or of value compared to other shows of this genre. Body-switching, time-loops, inexplicable memory loss and recovery. All of these tropes are entirely overdone by now and the show doesn't add anything particularly interesting which would make these plot points compelling. The first plot arc involving Mai slowly disappearing from people's memories is not something I've seen before and it was interesting, but by the end of episode 3 we never see anything else new or interesting. Then we revert to the standard ""boy rescues girls from their emotional trauma by shouting at them"" formula which feels too trite to even feel like you're watching anything at all. The show also pushes the romantic leads apart with the excuse of Mai always being gone for her career as a way to revert to easy-to-write and uninteresting dialogue.  
 
I finished this show based on the good will that the first few episodes bought for me but I'm left feeling as though I wasted my time. Beyond that, I feel like this series has made me lose some faith in anime as a whole, as it has reinforced the problem of shows that start off strong to lure people in then fall back on laziness and cost-effectiveness instead of truly striving for something of artistic merit.

    This is the Greatest Anime I have ever seen, at first i thought it was a bad idea to kill off you know who,but it actually improved the story line. Throughout all the episode i always found myself amazed and how epic things would get. Especially the ending. I recommend this Anime to everyone.

    Firstly I'd like to apologize for the future grammar/spelling errors. I'll try my best of my ability to make it as much as an enjoyable read, hence let's begin. 
 
  Firstly I'd like to say the fact that this anime is an odd one. Its odd. But tranquil. It had some sorrow moments, couple of cherful ones. Its a vast mix of feelings.  
  The story itself is about death. Everything revolves around death and final judgmement. People after death are sent, in our case, to Quindecim - the place where whole action revolves. Here in Quindecim people who passed away are coming without remembering anything about their circumstances.  
 
  They are to play a game, which is quite tricky and with the sole attempt of 'bringing their inner darkness to the surface'. The arbiter, is the master of the game, and at the end will give his judgement, but while people wouldn't be able to know if they're either sent to heaven or hell. ( Reincarnation or Void). 
 They're stepping into the elevators they came from, and at the top - there will be two masks. And the rest is thrill.  
 
What has fascinated me is that this anime is so complex deep inside, its odd but still seems relatively easy to digest.  
  Why would I recommend this to anybody- because its new. Its not your cliche plot. This is different and its well done. Kudos to the staff. 
 
 The show itself is at a average 8,5/10. I'm an odball and quite liked it myself- fitting my taste. So before the final episode my final grade was 9. 
But I changed my mind and gave it a clear 10. Why? What happened on the  
last episode? Just check and see. 
 
  Even if 1% listens to my advice and gives it a try, my job here is done.  
I truly appreciate those who had and will read my review. Ciao Ciao.

    To start of this is one of the most recent anime that has given with a relaxing great feeling as i watched it and followed it through atleast the early stages.  
 
While this is strange to  say this but i enjoyed this less in some ways as i went further out in the story but let me start at the beginning. The beginning is great in many ways that it gives you a good cool feel to it although that might feel slow for some i kinda love those beginnings that start that way. As the story progress we learn more about the main character story and what has happened through his life that gets alot more interesting. Its what i would call a low key dark anime that stays on the grey side of the world early on in the anime. As we get further there are some annoying parts which i have to blame some of the characters for the main character kinda being one of them mostly. Since as the story developes and sound more interesting it also goes away from being one of the more unique into what i would like to call a predictive plot line which in some ways starts to get slightly irritating for me as i watched it since it was ah yeah now this is gonna happen and now we have to wait that long for something new.  
 
Nice feeling to the art i felt i liked the way the eyes were made in this anime was very nice.  
 
The first opening and ending are one of those great ones you almost cant skip but you just love hearing it again and again. And if i combine it with the good and calm soundtrack i find myself saying only good things. The second opening and ending though is not up to par. They are less than interesting and feels like good enough op and endings but nothing special about them.  
 
I personally really like the main character Kiriyama, Rei alot atleast i do in the first 13 episodes or so and some later might have to do with the impact is lessening after a while but i feel he gets more uninteresting at times  in the later stages of the anime. Early he is this cool , calm and almost empathic feeling character thats interesting to follow but later he softens too much and starts to feel less like the one you started with in many ways. 
 
The Kawamoto sisters are an interesting bunch with personalities from 3 different of stages in a persons life. Child , Teenager and nearly adult. Although i at times can find them too imposing on the story and they can be a little too friendly in a sence. I also enjoy having them there since they sometimes helps the story on or help the main character. None of them are overly boring or annoying which i like but its not like everything about them is interesting either.  
 
I fully enjoyed this anime in many ways eventhough i have my complains about some of the later points i really enjoyed it in every way and it goes into one of my go back to anime when i feel like i need to watch anything.  
 
The anime never really got me to a 10 to be honest it felt to me more like an 9 or a strong 8 but in the end i felt it was unfair to give it anything but 9. If you like calm and relaxing anime that also gives you a great story then you will love this. I will almost say that you should love it in that case but if your not very fond of main characters that arent as action packed/ in your face or stories that arent as straight forward and a little slow then this anime might not be there for you but i hope most people will atleast give it a try.

       First anime ( besides classics like Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc ) , I've ever watched, many, many years ago, and one of the few that actually had some consistent impact upon me. And therefore, a trully memorable one. 
 
I've seen some people classifying ""Wolf's Rain"" as a "" werewolf anime "". I can't flat out object to this, because, one of the good points of this aproach, is that it gives you the freedom to percieve it in whatever shape you find most natural to digest, while all the focus goes straight to the essence, and through that, the anime manages to stay true to it's message. Yet, I can't exactly agree with them either.   
 
"" Wolf's Rain "" is the story of four wolves ( a race considered extinct for hundreds of years - they have human shapes ), who, in an apocalyptic world setting ( where most of the land has turned into an arid, unwelcoming wasteland ) and a collapsing, degraded society led by the Nobles ( who have distanced themselves from the rest of the humans, as a distinct, superior race ), go over their differences, and learn to cope with each other, banding together, in search for what all wolves are instinctively drawn to : the maiden of flowers. The one, that is the key to finding the Paradise.   
But in their journey, they have to go over many dangers, and obstacles, every one taking them a step closer to maturity. Because...the world is not a welcoming place for the likes of them, and they are also not the only ones who got tired of the society, and started to chase after such goals. 
 
It's a story of courage, of surpassing your limits ( or the limits you think you have ), of working together as well as on your own, for a common goal, and overcoming the impossible. But most of all, a story of freedom, freedom to stray away from the decadent society and its oftenly absurd norms, guided purely by your own instinct. To find...your paradise. 
 
This anime sets itself apart due to its remarkable simbolism, suited for everyone. It is abstract, original, and some may even find it a bit bizzare. If that's what you're looking for, then I highly recommend this one to you.   
...No, forget that, I recommend it anyway.

    Okay, so, maybe i'm a little late in the game for this one. This anime came out last year and I only watched it last night. Yes, last night. from about 11 pm to early this morning, I was up all night watching this anime.  
 
My friend has been pushing me to watch this anime for MONTHS. I kept putting it off, because usually I'm more into fluffy, gooey, romance, so-sweet-it'll-give-you-diabeeties type anime. Its a very rare occasion when an action type anime will catch my attention, but that might change after seeing ZNT. It was... incredible. The plot was amazing and it kept me at the edge of my seat all night, just waiting to see what was going to happen next. I'm pretty sure this was made by the same people who made Psycho Pass, which I really enjoyed. I should not have expected any less from this anime. The story, the characters, the twists and turns, all of it was so amazing. By the end of the night I was bawling my eyes out, but sometimes with anime you just have to do that. I HIGHLY reccomend this anime to anyone, weather you're an action fan or not.

    For the Guys who are looking for A FANSERVICE with actions on it...YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS! 
 
For the story: It has a good storyline but I can't take ""THE FEEDING OF SOMA"" scenes especially in season 2! GOSH!~ the story maker did a great job for the whole story! (even there's no sucking of breasts but I understand without it the story cannot be completed)....IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT WITHOUT THAT ""SUCKING OF BREASTS SCENES"" you can watch the censored version! 
 
ART: The artist also made a good job!!! The characters were designed suitably for their characters.....(but for the F*CKING ecchi scenes....I DON'T KNOW 'coz I preferably watched the censored version(actually both)) 
 
SOUND: I LOVE SEIKON NO QWAER'S OPENING AND ENDING SONGS!(especially Baptize by:Yousei teikoku! and CHARACTER SONGS OF THE FEMALE CHARACTERS' SEIYUU) AND ALSO THE SOUND EFFECTS WA FAIRLY GOOD.! 
 
CHARACTER: GREAT! I LOVE THE LOVE TEAM OF SASHA AND MAFUYU! HAHA! FOR EACH CHARACTERSISTICS IT WAS THE BEST FOR THEM!  ESP. KATJA'S ""SHOCKING"" CHARACTER..lol! 
 
ENJOYMENT: I REALLY ENJOYED IT BUT BECAUSE OF THAT  DAMN SCENES ITS KINDA..................MAYBE FOR OTHERS...ENJOYED IT 
 
OVERALL: I LOVE BOTH THE FIRST SEASON AND THE SECOND SEASON!GAMBARE SNQ!

    Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare, or Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya, is the second film in the Gintama franchise, written by the author of Gintama,  Hideaki Sorachi. Written as a possible end to the anime, this film brings Gintama into darker and more dramatic territory, more so then ever before, whilst still balancing the film with the humour that made the series so popular. All this, and more, is all blended together to create one of the best anime films created in modern days. 
 
The film opens with the Yorozuya crew workng in a theater,and whilst it looks like a pre-film short, it's actually the opening to the film itself,and leads into the main plot. We find Gintoki Sakata in a world, five years in the future, where the world is falling apart, and he quickly find his friends and associates are all very different in this post apocalyptic world. Once the the main part of the film is reached, the story does not feel rushed, and does not drag out. In my opinion, the film is paced perfectly. 
 
One of the things that worried me was that this may indeed be the end of Gintama. Whilst now it feels likely that the anime series will continue, the way the plot of this movie is brought to a close really does bring a sense of finality to the series, and when it comes down to it, I would be perfectly happy if the series ended with this movie, as it accomplishs the rare feat of bring a popular series to a (possible) close. 
 
Though, lets forget the plot for a few moments, and talk about the characters, one of the most praised aspects of the Gintama series. As stated above, this is a world five years in the future, and all of Gin's friends are very, very different. We see Shinpachi and Kagura all grown up, no longer the children they were. Every character has been affected by the events of this film, and all of them now have different ideals, not to mention new character designs. Gin, Shinpachi, and Kagura's characters are all very, very fleshed out. 
 
When it really comes down to it, this is the one part of the film that slightly suffers - whilst the redesigns of the characters are all well and good, we don't get enough time to learn more about -why- these characters are so different. Outside of Shinpachi and Kagura, we learn very little about why characters such as Katsura, Hijikata, and Sougo are so different. Within the medium of the film, however, this is acceptable, as they couldn't keep the rest of the film at such a high level whilst devoting an equal amount of time to both characters and plot. 
 
Of course, with this being a high budget film, the art and sound of the film are breathtaking, with new music recorded for the film, and the fight scenes never looking so amazing. To my delight, some music from the earlier seasons of Gintama is also used near the end of the film, again bringing a sense of finality to the film. SPYAIR, who's song, ""Sakura Mitsu Tsuki"", was used as the second opening of Gintama' : Enchousen, return to the franchise, composing the song, ""Genjo Destruction"", as the main theme of the music. Finally, as the second of two ending songs, ""Pray"", by Tommy heavenly6, we get a sense of nostalgia for those who watched Gintama from he very beginning. 
 
In closing, Gintama: The Final Chapter, manages to accomplish the rare feat of an (possible) ending film that manages to deliver on all aspects. Whilst it's a shame some of the supporting characters could not fleshed out enough, it's understandable due to the limited time of the medium. All in all, Gintama: The Final Chapter: Yorozuya Forever is a truly stellar anime film, that should be a benchmark for all anime franchise films to aspire to.

    The first season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was the absolute best anime of Winter, 2016, and very possibly the best anime of that entire year. It was certainly the most moving, truly adult, drama I've seen in a long time. Appropriately enough, since rakugo is the art of storytelling, the first season took the form of a story within a story, telling an incredibly moving tale of a complicated friendship, tragic choices, and the repercussions of those actions for people living in the present day. It was haunting, memorable, and it's been a very, very long year waiting for the sequel. 
 
The second season starts with a recap told in the form of a rakugo tale--this was an absolutely perfect, and perfectly logical, choice. You're immediately transported back into the space of the rakugo theater, and anticipating the next chapter of the big story ahead. This time, we're completely in the present day (or at least as much as is possible, as history and memory always informs the present for the characters in this drama), and instead of learning about rakugo's past, we get to see how it's faring in contemporary Japan. We also learn how, or whether, the main characters can move forward with their own lives.  
 
The real joy of this show is to see how Yakumo (the perpetually stubborn, dissatisfied, depressed, and yet extraordinarily charismatic rakugo master), Konatsu (now a mother, and thankfully just as stubborn, prickly, passionate, and intelligent as always), and Yotarou (a newly-minted rakugo star, always playing the fool but clearly much smarter than he likes to appear) interact. There's absolutely no reason in the world for these three to be connected. From decades-long resentments to daily irritations, the only way to explain it is that they're a (very unconventional) family, and sometimes you don't get to choose those deep connections that bind you far more powerfully than you may ever realize.  
 
In a very real way this is a terribly moving romance, one that ties three disparate personalities together in their love of rakugo and their fundamental love for one another. Yotarou’s centrality in this dynamic becomes a major theme over time, but the magic is in observing the intricate dance of recrimination, guilt, and reconciliation that defines Yakumo and Konatsu’s roles in this drama. If you aren’t reduced to tears when watching the final scenes of episode ten, then you’re far stronger than I am. It’s one of the most powerful and genuine moments in any creative form that I have ever experienced.  
 
This show is written and directed exquisitely, giving time for characters to develop slowly, allowing conversations to unfold naturally, and always making room for silent spaces that are more overwhelming than traditional dramatic crescendos in almost all other series. One of the most beautiful and memorable moments is a very small scene in which Konatsu’s infant son interrupts Yakumo while he’s playing the shamisen, and in that encounter we learn much more about who Yakumo really is than most shows convey about a character in an entire episode of “big” revelations. Gestures, glances, and the smallest alteration of an expression are powerful in this drama, and the animation takes full advantage of the ways in which visual elements can encompass nuances that words cannot. As the episodes progress, keep close watch upon how Yakumo is drawn. The level of care given to his face and body is eloquent. The animators tell stories in every line. 
 
The second season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu may just be better than the first. After living with this story and its protagonists for a while, it's easy to appreciate the nuances of personality and dialogue that imbue almost every scene of this show with subtle emotional resonance. After the enormous revelations and emotional impact of season one, even small developments now take on new dimensions. Plus, this season is about the future. It's exciting to see what happens next. After falling in love with this story and its characters, I never wanted it to just remain in the past. I'm glad that we can look forward as well, even with the full awareness that progression through time, while it carries hope, also entails self-doubt, continued pain over past losses, and uncertainty as to whether what’s to come will necessarily result in happiness.  
 
This show is a masterpiece of storytelling, as it should be. It knows that life doesn't often proceed by giant dramas and great occurrences. Life is the incremental accumulation of moments, and these sedimentary layers, overlapping across lived time, comprise each of our pasts. As every new memory, experience, or choice is added to that slowly forming bedrock, the character of the whole is forever changed. While we are a product of our past, the present continually shapes us into something new. It's captivating to see these layers form in Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, and it's joyful to see how life is always surprising, intoxicating, and forever a source of beautiful, shimmering stories.

    As a huge fan of  Kouta Hirano´s earlier work Hellsing, I was really excited to dig my teeth into his new work Drifters. I didn´t how ever have my hopes to high, due to that Hellsing Ultimate is one of my favorite shows so far, and it would be really hard to do something equally amazing. Hence it will be a lot of comparison between the two in my review. But how did ""Drifters"" delivered in my opinion? I will get down to that now. 
 
Story: 7/10 
Unlike ""Hellsing"" the story of ""Drifters"" takes place in a fantasy world full of elf's, dwarfs, magicians, goblins and so on. The drifters are moved to this world from our own through a world-less corridor on the verge of death by a quite weird looking guy in glasses. They are all real famous historical personas (such as Oda Nobunaga, Shimazu Toyohisa, Hannibal and so on). The ""evil"" versions of the drifters is called ""ends"" and are also historical famous personas such as Jeanne dÁrc, Rasputin and so on. Elf´s and dwarfs has been forced to live in slavery and oppression by the humans, and with the help of the drifters (the warroir Toyohisa, the tactician Nobunaga and sneaky Yoichi) they make their move for liberation. But the ""Ends"" and their leader The Black King has their own plan for this world and a three way war is instigated.  
 
As for the layout of the story - I quite like it. It´s not the most original out there, but it´s interesting enough to keep me watching and actually care of the plot. This is just the first season so many questions will still be there in the end of this season. Like who is the Black King? What made Jeanne dÁrc so evil? What Easy´s and Murasaki´s beef all about? This is questions that will not be answered in this first part. There is a heavy focus on war strategy and a lot of talk of it the show. If that stuff bores you.. well, this could be a heavy watch. I found it quite interesting due to the psychological point of view. How much of war that depends on how we play on each others emotions - it made the war scenes more realistic. And as expected of a work from  Kouta Hirano it´s a lot of violence, blood and gore. I will for shore dig into the manga now to see how this develops from here.  
 
Art: 9/10 
As of expected of an 2016 anime, the art is very good. Drifters actually got it´s own studio just to produce it - that´s say something. You can clearly see the similarities between the art in Drifters and Hellsing - especially the characters designs. I am actually quite a fan of that particular style, I was glad to see it on screen again. It´s very colorful with distinct blackened lines. The eyes and hairs of the characters are what could called a hallmark for Kouta Hirano. Some scenes can feel a bit blurry to all that is going on but hey.. War is a mayham so that didn´t bother me to much. And of course their is a couple of great action scenes. The scenery is often well drawn and the characters fits nicely in to the background.   
 
Sound: 8/10 
I absolutely love the opening. I actually listen to it daily now. It´s adrenaline, funky rock song that suites the show and it´s characters very well. The ending is quite nice as well if note less original. The overall soundtrack is well suited and often manages to highlight the mood of the scene or coolness of the character in the spotlight. All music wasn´t my coop of tea, but I can see how it fits the show. I watch the dubbed and I think the VA´s mostly did a great job. I love Robert McCollum and he voices Oda Nobunaga and does it greatly. Mostly the VA´s manages to catch the essence of their character and bringing life to them. Had a slightly problem with Omis VA - she had a very squicky voice that could be hard to listen to sometimes.  
 
Character: 8/10 
It´s a lot of characters in Drifters, many of them appears interesting and most of them don´t get the screen time they deserve (many of the ends mostly). For the three mains they differ a bit in quality but are for shore vivid. For a 12 episode anime it´s hard for the characters to really develop, so the development is very limited. As in Hellsing most of the characters are adults, not teenagers with hormonal problems. They know what and who they are and just go from there. Toyohisa actually remained me of Eren from Attack on Titan - as he may be in he´s 30´s. Both his looks and passionate speeches was something that remained med of him (without the anger issues). Nobunaga is a coldblooded war tactician and a conqueror of land and men - it´s what he does best and advances his position with. Yoichi hasn´t had much of a background exploration and are mostly there to look very cute and blast arrows into people. Hope he´s evolves more in season two.  
 
As for the side´s, its a broad variation of interesting and bland characters. I find the Ends as very interesting but as said before, very little screen time to really making them into great antagonists/villains. I slight minus for me was the lack of badass female characters (Jeane dÁrc and Anastasia a aside), which Helling had loads of. Come on it´s a three way war - it is certainly room for at least one ore two.  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
It wasn´t Helling but I really enjoyed watching this piece anyway. Crazy characters, violence, liberation movements and revenge is always a winning concept for me. I watch it all in just a couple of days time and enjoyed most of it. Some of the comedy felt misplaced and some was nailed - as i most anime. For not to mention the awesome opening, It´s worth to watch by it lonesome. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
It was a good anime experience for shore. It didn´t bring anything new or very original to the plate, but managed to be entertaining anyway. If you like seinens/actions like Hellsing you most likely will dig this piece. I will for shore take a look where this is going. I liked the preemies and the show has potential to grow a lot and become something more.

    It set up really well to then leave the scene, and give the spotlight to the angsty pizza boy. 
 
The show started out looking promising but failed to keep a good pacing. It gave one of the most forced and painfully pretentious protagonists I've seen.  
It keeps trying to convince you you should like him, although his timid and naive nature is just too unconvincing. The show then wants you to believe his Jesus transformation syndrome, which is a thing that's always really corny but it's done really poorly here by not even having the story events really arc into this transformation and character development. Which comes off as (a thing very common in anime) the creator's self-insertion. When you can't mistake the feeling, of the artist trying very hard to live out his fantasy through a fictional character in their own personal project. Usually this character will come off as lacking depth or any sort of realistic reaction to what happens around them. Which leaves the viewer with a feeling that they're just looking at someone's personal ego boosting. This protagonist is the big problem, but sadly not the only problem. 
 
Tokyo Ghoul started out really well. It had an interesting idea and a first episode that really paced itself well. It was shrouded in mystery that gave you the sense of ""All will soon be revealed to you"". All was indeed revealed. With little to no fanfare whatsoever. It was explained in a manner as if what is going on here is as normal as drinking your morning coffee. And it comes off with the message that they're just different, and you shouldn't hate others for being different. Insert a whiney ""Don't judge me!"" here. The show really hammers in how pretentious it is, and I'm pretty sure the writers are completely unaware of it. 
 
There was something of potential here, there really was. But it casts away society and the general public view on this problem of ghouls living in the city. After the first episodes it all shrinks into this really small world. Just a couple of small groups of people, and gives the spotlight completely to characters that are frankly not strong enough to carry the show home. It would really have been nice if the show had kept consistent for one thing, but even more importantly, treated its premise with care. It starts out like it should, addressing the existence of ghouls as a problem to society. But it shrugs it off and just becomes small gang skirmishes... and barely even. We don't get any reason to why the ghouls even exist. There's no endeavor to make the viewer actually care about what's happening. This should've had a bigger plot. It's just a series of small forgettable events, and no plot. 
 
Its art style is pretty nice... the animation is pretty good too. Nothing amazing but it's good enough. What I really think is done well in Tokyo Ghoul is lighting. Lighting, shading and character outlines. The voice acting isn't really anything to critize either. 
 
The opening sequence was decent with a decent song, but the real feast, is the ending sequence, that sets a tone the show in general should've tried to mimic. The songs fit the aesthetic really well. 
 
So to sum it up. Tokyo Ghoul had something going for it. If it had just treated its premise with better care. But the main problem is an extremely lacking protagonist that steals the show, but has nothing to show for it.

    I tried so hard to like this show I liked the premise (Ya know ninjas) and this was some people's childhoods, but I personally found that's all it really was. The only good thing about this show I can say is the music, other than that the characters suck the only two I actually enjoyed were Rock lee and Hinata as they had actual personalities outside of Dr. Family issues and Mr. I wanna be the best there ever was. Outside of that the story itself is poorly paced with a lot of nothing just to get a something that somehow still wasn't set up very well which make the simple blunders and contradictions that most other shows can get away with painfully and stick out like a sore thumb. Example: Chunin exams during the fight sequences the one girl (on rock lee's team) was set up to be smart but proceeds to do the same thing over and over again even though it was proven to be completely ineffective the first time. Overall I watched way too many episodes of this show but I really wanted to like it, I can't say anything about Shippuden because I frankly don't want to watch it after this. I give this a 3 with the tagline of one of those shows that you shouldn't go back to when you're older.

    Okay, folks... Hold onto your handkerchiefs... 
 
Clannad: After story picks up after the original animated series ""Clannad"" and follows the life of Tomoya and Nagisa after high school. Im not gonna spoil any further cause you are indeed in for one hell of a roller coaster of emotions.  
 
The art of this franchise is so draw droppingly beautiful in both Clannad and After story (not to mention the Visual novel). Each scene looks like such care was put into the details. Fluid motion of the characters and the natural movements show the hard work put into After Story.  
 
If you like Romance and drama with light humor, this anime is for you. If you want to watch After Story, you have to watch Clannad to understand the plot because it jumps right back in to where Clannad ended.

    The word bland describes this Anime well. 
 
I don’t have issues with the art style having watched quite a few older series which employ the art style used yet utilizing such a simple style actually makes errors stand out even more. Everything feels like the characters were done by someone still learning the craft. What I don’t know is whether this is the fault of the animation staff or the creator of the Manga. There are a few beautiful watercolors, yet most of the scenes are overly simplistic and the character design doesn’t fit with the actual scenery style making the work even more jarring. 
 
As for the actual characters – there is no getting around the fact they are boring. They are comprised of one or two traits, but the main characters main trait is clumsiness which makes me bring up something quite a few have heard since Twilight came out – clumsiness is a flaw.  I don’t understand why the guy they’re supposed to be protecting isn’t involved with the plot more let alone why he’s not allowed to fight let alone given a method of fighting. In fact, nothing ever really gets explained. The characters get their powers easily. 
 
On top of this the plot is high school drama with powers in addition to said drama, yet the humor is painfully cliché. I’ve heard a lot of the jokes before, they’re poorly done or just plain petty. I’m not even understanding why the yuri/yaoi fanservice ended up in the series and just comes across as creepy. In fact, the girls who are the heroes -they’re not really likable characters, yet they’re supposed to be pure of heart and have the ability to save the world. 
 
No, the series isn’t satire poking fun of the pure of heart trope which comes up with this type of character. 
 
Even the cultural references didn’t save the series.

    Where was the essence? 
I am not a regular sleeve reader, in fact, do not complete any to date. 
When it was about to leave the anime of ""Yakusoku No Neverland"" to wait for the anime I decided to enter the manga that was being the sensation. My first impressions were excellent. The arch of the orphanage, which was developed in the first season is one of the best, because it is cooked on a low fire and the words, gestures and actions of the characters are worth a lot to reflect their intentions. I do not think that the anime has failed in anything in particular, correct animation, great dubbing, spectacular opening, absolutely everything is fine ... per I miss something. 
I do not know what it is. Maybe the essence of the manga, perhaps, those long debates with an immovable image and only your reading accompanying what it says. The problem itself is not in the adaptation because it is excellent, but in that this is a very relaxed arc and more talks and planning than action. The following ones will be more impressive in this aspect and I hope so, but this part of the arc I prefer to read it than to see it. 
Equal, it was shown that it is in excellent hands because they gave us some planes and camera games for other interesting to add some tension to the scenes. 
I hope the second season has 24 episodes so adapt the bow of ""the hunt"" because there I hope for a great and impressive animation.

    My overall rating of YOI would probably be a 5.5. Don't get me wrong, this anime was quite enjoyable for me. I wouldn't go as far as to rave about it, but it was entertaining. The best way to sum it up for me would be to call it cute. 
 
Story 
I don't think the story was anything that blew me away, it started off okay. I was into it enough to finish the series. My only problem with it was I found myself questioning the importance of some elements and why certain things were developed and others were not. This is more so about characters, but I""ll get into that more later. 
 
Art 
I liked the art style, it was cute and colorful and very upbeat. Very good for a lighthearted and short anime. 
 
Sound 
The sound was all right, I couldn't get into the other skaters' music that much. I found the opening grew on me after a bit, and I liked Yuri's music he skated to in the beginning. Otherwise, it didn't really stand out to me as a soundtrack. 
 
Character 
The characters started off okay, and they were fun to watch. My biggest disclaimer about this show is don't go into it wanting amazing character development, you're not going to get it. I had to remind myself not to get tunnel vision when it comes to the characters, because it can be easy to be sucked into wanting to be frustrated by the same characters not changing much if at all. 
 
Enjoyment 
I did enjoy this anime, I did look forward to the next episode of it. The show wasn't bad, I did enjoy it. YOI is a good lighthearted anime if you want something to watch and enjoy without too much seriousness. What conflicted with my enjoyment was my frustration at Victor and Yuri's relationship not really going anywhere. I didn't feel like Yuri changed much and I didn't see why they couldn't work it out, because the relationship dynamic would have worked out really well in my opinion. 
 
Overall 
I liked YOI, I would totally recommend it if you're thinking of watching it. Just don't push anything you're really into right now to make room for it. I don't know if it's a show I would be able to binge watch in a day, it's a little too fluffy for that. I just couldn't get past the unsatisfying ending. I felt like it was too ambiguous and played too safe. I know that not everything is so black and white, but what frustrated me is that the dynamic between Yuri and Victor was, and it was so muddied by external factors that it became more complicated than it needed to be.

    story- easy to follow, very unique, enjoyable 
 
art- simple SoL style, no over-size boobs (ty), cute, fitting 
sound- fitting VA, didn't pay too much attention to sound tracks was too busy enjoying hikigaya's relatable philosophy 
 
character- extremely unique, strong protagonist, still many mysteries to yukinoshita but not typical at all (i've been waiting for something like this for a very long time), i don't like their names but i'm sure there's some meaning behind them 
 
enjoyment- very, would rewatch/recommend 
 
*lots of light fanservice for yaoi lovers (ignorable for yaoi haters) 
*i strongly relate to ebina and hikigaya

    Overall/Enjoyment: 
This was alright. A little slow, but enough to maybe get you interested in watching the TV series. Since this is a fighting show, you have to take it for what it is. The thing I probably like most about Shadow Skill is how the fights take place. I like the use of (Shinto?) card magic in this series, particularly the fact that they give little speeches of their abilities, almost as if they are actual partners. The special techniques (i.e. Shadow Skills) used are similarly interesting.  
 
Story: 
A very rough image of the world is painted and the conflicts and situations are certainly more involved/interesting. A common problem with shonen shows like this however is that they seem to have some trouble developing the non-action segments. Exposition usually comes in the form of inexplicably detailed dialogue, often with strangers, sometimes while fighting, and/or as some kind of inner monologue. This can be a bit annoying (and silly), especially if what is being said is uninteresting or uninformative. 
 
Characters: 
You do get a better sense of the characters and their friends in this one.  Some of the characters names are pretty silly though. 
 
Art: 
The art in this one is different than the previous OVA. It's more solid, colorful and fluid, but also uses some really thick lines and pretty strange designs. Of course it still retains that same weird, old, &quot;perpetually hazy,&quot; look. 
 
Sound: 
The music was ok I guess. I don't remember it evoking too much of a sense of excitement, certainly not very often. The dubbing on the other hand is comically terrible. So much so you may enjoy this show more if you find that kind of thing funny, and have the stomach to sit through some of the worst voice acting possible.

Akira is a 1988 anime film adaptation of the manga of the same name. It is a classic in the medium and set a high standard for every post-apocalyptic and cyberpunk setting that came after it. The film is highly praised but apparently received hefty criticism for it's retelling of its source material, however not having read the manga I have no skin in that game and can say the movie was very enjoyable. 
 
The art direction, sound design, and theming of the film really takes a heavy influence from live action films like Blade Runner, Escape From New York, and The Warriors in all the best ways imaginable. I find it enjoyable looking back into the past at the cycle of inspiration those films likely sprouted into the anime medium.  
 
The film looks fantastic and the only complaint about this work of arts amazing hand drawn animation I could muster is some characters faces look really derpy at times.  
 
The only two words of caution for a potential viewer I will provide is that this movie is disturbingly graphic a.k.a ""Devilman: Crybaby Style"" and the plot being taken from a multi-volume manga condensed into a 2 hour movie is VERY confusing and nonsensical. That said if you don't mind or even enjoy body horror, and don't need to understand what you just watched then Akira will likely be one of the best films you've ever seen.  
 
It's just really cool and really good. Trust me. (God I'm out of practice with these.)

    This show is average and such a parody of the first season and the genre that I do not recommend watching this show.  
 
Even though it has been a few years I before watching this second season I remembered all of the good that the first season did. It was nothing entirely original and the familia premise was nice but what made the first season so enjoyable because it was a well executed underdog story of Bell Cranel getting stronger with a few passable ecchi scenes.  
 
However, season two does not capture that same enjoyment simply because it's execution and direction was not on par with the first season.  
 
Story: 5/10  
The story continues on from the first season about Bell trying to get stronger and find more girls in dungeons and without spoiling, he does get into trouble. However, it is not the sort of trouble that gets the watchers tense or explores a theme of the show it is simply a poorly executed conflict that had barely any interesting qualities. From the minotaur scene and early dungeon scenes from the first season, this season does not capture the same heart. It feels like a slice of life fantasy like Konnosuba rather than an action adventure series.   
 
Art: 7/10  
One of the best qualities of DanMachi was that it always had nice art and animation. While it isn't anything top tier, it is still enjoyable to look at.  
 
Sound: 7/10   
The opening and endings are good again nothing special but they do their jobs the same as the OSTs.  
 
Characters: 5/10  
The characters in this anime are so average. One of the bigger themes of this anime is Bell gaining more experience and strength. He moves from his humble beginnings as the Little Rookie into a more accomplished adventurer however there is literally nothing interesting about him. He is plain and average and he along with the rest of the anime are completely filled with tropes. No other character in this anime feels even remotely interesting. Lili-kun is probably the only one with the interesting story but they executed in such a boring manner that all of her intrigue quickly dissipated.  
 
Enjoyment: 5/10  
This season is completely average and missable It does not capture the same charm as the first season did and feels more like a parody of itself and the genre similarly to Konosuba except DanMachi attempts to take itself seriously.   
 
Overall: 5/10  
Again, I do not recommend watching this show. It is average with very little redeeming qualities. If you want to watch something in a similar type of world then I suggest watching Konosuba. It's a comedy that knows it's a comedy and it executes it impeccably.

    At first glance when I saw Toradora, I did not expect anything much. I wasn't interested in rom-com at that time so my expectations were just a show that can fill my time up, whether if it's interesting or not. The moment the play button was pressed, I fell in love with this show.  
 
The 5 main characters were unique in their own way, bringing out the friendship pointer. Despite being so different, they were still able to interact just fine, the comedy just makes their friendship way more polished. 
 
The story was simple & basic, with the combination of the characters & comedy though, brought one heck of a show. Toradora isn't just now a typical rom-com series, but a show unique to itself.

    One of Bakemonogatari's main purpose is the exploration of its concept regarding the supernatural. In addition to this, Bakemonogatari heavily focuses on dialogue that gives a heavy sense of social realism and realistic character traits we see in everyday humans. 
For the conflicts that happen throughout the story, the lessons are meant to be learned figuratively. Things that happen within the plot feel satisfying due to unique character actions and interactions that feel realistic and understandable. 
There is very little generalization upon any one character besides Sengoku Nadeko. However, this problem is washed away upon Second Season where her character blooms fully. Every other character feels unique, meaning they generally do not feel like other characters. Now although in wording it may sound simplistic and therefore unimpressive, Bakemonogatari handles the difference of characters in believable ways with each character holding many different set of morals, beliefs, knowledge and anything a person may possess. Time is something valuable, and Bakemonogatari uses this time wisely to not only let us bond with the characters, but to let us understand that there exists a critical dimension of personality for its characters. 
This is how stories make good characters. Good is not something like a good person though... Good is how realistic & believable a character feels; and to make a character feel real, there must be little room to question the aspects of their lives that we do not see. 
 
This anime is visually unique, possibly one of the most abstract creative artful anime. The animations may not be filled with a lot of doing, but the show may have still-shot images to fit and invoke the atmosphere of the scene. 
 
Music-wise, the soundtracks are extremely pleasant. Not the exciting kind of pleasant, but more so on the relaxation side; you could listen to this music in any generic time, like when you are doing your homework. It's not precisely relaxing like meditative music (although that's possible), but its great for a casual life. And because of this, the music helps greatly to let yourself be at ease while you watch the show. 
 
With those two aspects said and done (Art & Sound), mainly I will review why the writing for the characters of Bakemonogatari are done so well.  
 
The characters aren't simply unique towards one another, but the major uniqueness comes from its realistic and believable characters compared to other anime. You get the sense that these characters more than likely exist; or at least someone out there would be almost identical to them in personality, beliefs and/or ideals. While watching the show, you get to experience and explore the thoughts and actions of the characters, and each and every character is mentioned often enough (whether they are on-screen or not) that it's as if the viewer will understand the sense that those characters are living their own lives, not actually being scripted, even extremely minor characters such as Senjougahara Hitagi's father. 
 
The production's styling of the characters in relevance to the overall story is something special. It's not neither cliche nor forced; we expect to not see the end of any one road/conflict, because the characters themselves have no goal that feels generic like saving the world, defeating evil, etc. Even if that kind of concept is iterated upon certain characters, it is a mindset for the characters (to emphasize their personalities) rather than a plot's purpose. Characters are shown as if they are naturally so, like human beings living their lives without a clear end-goal. 
 
Lastly, the show does well towards its emphasis upon the feelings of characters, more than anything else. That's where its sole objective lies: ""How Do These Characters Feel as the story progresses?"" And we majorly discover and discover... repeatedly discover more and more that we are wrong. That we are always wrong. Wrong about how we saw these characters in the first place, and that these characters are like real individuals; unable to be judged by our preconceived notions. This is the dimension of character complexity that makes Bakemonogatari a respectable work.

    Kuroshitsuji II 
(two stars like this ** means that there is a spoiler coming up, and you should skip to the next set of stars) 
 
And here we come to a sequel. Sequels can be a good thing, if expressed correctly and if it is relevant to the parent story, much like an OVA. And let’s be honest – if a show is THAT good, and it ends in a sort of open ended way, shouldn’t it just stay like that? I mean, I’m pretty sure no one wants to know what happened to Azmaria at the end of Chrono Crusade. And though I used to hope for it, I like the way the Code Geass series ended. You were left with either believing he was dead or alive in some other world. Quite honestly, I think that’s the best kind of ending – one that you’ll remember long after finishing the story. And this sequel is just passable. I preferred the way the first season ended, because it was just at the cataclysm that Ciel dies. Or, it was assumed so. I just don’t like the way it all took off. And sadly, it doesn’t look like they’re done. (I'm grading this according to the MAL number ruling - a six is fair, meaning its not great but it isn't bad either. 
 
Art: 
 
The art hasn’t changed much if at all from the first season. If there was a change, then it was so small I couldn’t even notice it. So I’ll give it the same art score I would’ve given the first season. 
 
Sounds: 
 
Nothing to say about the ending and opening soundtracks. They weren’t overly enjoyable or disappointing, they were just ok. The soundtrack in the show, however, is a different story. The sound track of the second season is just as enjoyable as the soundtrack of the first. Beautiful melodies that mask sorrow or that exempt it all together – that’s the kind of music you can hope to hear from this show. 
 
Story: 
 
To make it simply and clear: There really is no story at the beginning. The first episode brings Ciel back, and then it’s just…“what?” until episode 6. Don’t get me wrong, you enjoy this arc, as you reminisce with old characters, but it all seems irrelevant to the story – and that’s a problem. This, to me, is always what can make any viewer drop an anime. If the show flies way out with an idea or its arc is too long and irrelevant, you gotta wonder why you’re still watching it. I can’t tell you how many shows I was excited to watch, that I ended up dropping because the arcs got too boring and I began to question its relevance. But this is not the case, it was a little over played, yes, but it was enjoyable, and that makes up for it. In the end, the reconciliation of the characters, though late and not very deep, is strong, albeit a little more confusing than it should have been.  
 
Characters: 
 
Ciel and Sebastian are old news. Elizabeth has very obviously taken a liking to Ciel, even more so than is noticeable in the first season. And sadly, you don’t get to see much of her after the first few episodes. And then we get to Alois Trancy. A homoerotic, sadistic **(actually gay, as we see in the first scene)** freak. **People may argue that he was forced into it, but he doesn’t seem at all deeply affected by it. Almost like it just doesn’t bother him.**  He is utterly disgusting and despicable to say the least. It’s not because he’s gay, but because of the way he acts and the way he treats others.  His butler, Claude, is another freaky one. When you meet him, you sort of get the feeling he’s like…Sebastian from wal-mart. Like, Sebastian is a nicely polished Lamborghini or BMW, and Claude is just a cheap knock off, like a  90’s era Toyota Corolla, or Dodge Grand Caravan. They just don’t compare. Maybe I’m being a little biased, perhaps because I already know Sebastian from the first season and have seen just how good he is at what he does. And, his humor has upped its ante from the first season – there was one specific part that I couldn’t stop laughing about midway through the series that I had to watch again and again. You also start to wonder what the hell other characters are even doing in the story. And the truth is, you won’t know until you get to episode 5 or whatever, when the story starts to make sense, as they’re all explaining what has happened thus far. In simpler terms, your favorite characters don’t exactly get enough air time this time around. I was honestly hoping for some more bonding with Lizzy. But that was shot.  
 
Enjoyment: 
 
While I still wouldn’t exactly categorize this show as pure fan service or maybe even partly fan service, it does deliver a lot of what you’re hoping to see. Not because its eye candy, although that is sometimes the case, but because it relates to the story, or helps set up a premise to the next or future setting. I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Even though the first few episodes you’re confused to no end, the last few episodes stick to the main plot and the point it is trying to get across is received clearly. Though, the ending was probably a disappointment simply because it ended, and made you think that the story could honestly have just not even started if it was going to end the way it did.  **With Sebastian being trapped into eternal loyalty.** 
 
Faults: 
 
I think the series was a great piece of work, but to be perfectly honest, it almost seems like the creators tried to make something out of nothing. I think that they wanted another season, and to make it possible, they brought Ciel back. He was dead at the end of the first season, and it should have just ended there. If the production team had wanted to do more work, they could’ve just chosen to do an entirely new series. I wanted to watch this sequel because I assumed it would ONLY be based on Alois Trancy and his butler.  **Now, however, they’re both dead.** And it only seems like it’ll get worse, as word of a possible 3rd season is going around. 
 
Overall: 
 
This being a direct sequel, you are obligated to watch the first season in order to get this one. I honestly thought this was going to be a standalone show with just Alois, but that was wrong. Way wrong. Anywho, it was a great watch. I have personally been getting pretty bored with all the new anime coming out this season, as they are either too cliché or they haven’t finished (I had a bad experience waiting for Bakemonogatari to finish, since I started watching it a week before the last episode was supposed to come out, only to find out that the last episode was going to be coming out HALF A DAMN YEAR LATER). I’ve started to watch MM! and the new To-LOVE-ru, and hope to finish them soon to write a review.

    Ah Kobato... 
 
If you look at my anime list, you will notice that Im very picky when it comes to rating. And seldomly do I ever give away a full 10 points. The only anime so far on my list that has gotten a full 10 points is Clannad. I praised it holy and as a milestone in my anime watching career. 
 
And now! The time has come to gift a new wonderfull anime 10 points, and oh shall we prais its presence next to Clannad at the top of my ranking. 
 
This anime... I rated it as a 10 - Masterpiece because if there is one word id choose to describe it, it would be: Beatiful. 
 
Its perfectly balanced story wise and very enjoyable to watch. The characters are all lovable and unique. Everything about this anime, from the story to the music is just plain beatiful. 
One thing I realy love is the art. A big plus point is the way the faces are drawn, they are somewhat unique and new, but very nice to look at. You will probaly fall in love with this style after the first episode. And Kobato's dresses are also very adorable to look at. 
The story is very flat and easy to follow, alltho this anime will surley make you heart soft and bring forward a couple tears, its overall enjoyment is outstanding. You laugh, you cry, and then you cry again because it makes you so happy. Clannad had thies elements, but compared to Clannad, Kobato is easier to watch and lighter hearted. 
 
Now there is something I want to share with all of you. I am a big fan of Chobits, a former anime also made by Clamp. And when you watch this anime and you are familiar with Chobits, you will notice some things that will realy give you a pleasent supprise content wise. Im going to list thies little easter eggs here because they realy made my heart go ""awww isnt this awsome"". 
 
- The resedent that Kaboto stays at, is the exact same one from chobits, the twin sisters are the Chobit sisters (chi and her sister) and the resedent owner is the wife of the creater of the chobit series, who is also the mother to them. 
 
- The bakery that Kaboto works at every once in a while is named ""Tirol"" and the shop owner and his assistant are the same ones out of Chobits. 
 
I think there was 1 or 2 more but I cant think of them atm. But basicly thies characters out of the Chobits anime are in Kaboto's world in a Human state, basicly like everything should have been. At least thats my impression and gave this anime an extra flavor that I truly loved. 
 
Its hard to put all the emotions and beaty of this anime in to words, im not even going to try very hard because I dont want to screw anything up and leave a odd impression. 
 
So to all you comedy, drama, romance genre fans out there! Kobato is defently a MUST WATCH anime. And when you watch it, I hope you love it as much as I do. It defently earned thos 10 points.

    Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, by all accounts, should have been a completely forgettable and mediocre show having the pretense of being a teaser anime for Cygames and their mobile card game. The source material has the plot of a piece of cardboard and is little more than a collection of conceptual artwork. With all those things in mind, Studio MAPPA rises to the challenge and completely shatters my non-existent expectations as they set the standard for a promotional show.   
 
Taking place within a fantasy setting where the combined efforts of mankind, gods and demons have successfully sealed away the world-destroying Bahamut, the world of Mistarcia enters into an era of peace. To insure that Bahamut would be forever encaged in its prison, the seal's key was split into two pieces and given to the gods and demons respectively. Two thousand years, a  women named Amira manages to steal the gods' half of the key and that where the show chooses to kick off its epic adventure. Caught up in Amira's quest to reach the land of Helhelm are two bounty hunters with clashing sets of personalities and values.  
 
The plot is simple enough and easy to follow but Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis's strength lies in its brilliant execution and ever-escalating set pieces. Human, monsters, gods and demons of all different shapes and sizes come in for a battle royale that never fails to disappoint because the action is paced to be fast and furious which leaves little room for exposition. This actually works in the show's favor because it let the viewer's knowledge of other fantasy shows fill in the gaps instead of piling on explanations that would only get in the way. Fights takes place in varying degrees of captivating environments as the show overwhelm the viewers with its extravaganza displays.  It does fall victim to losing momentum towards the middle portion as a dreaded recap episode shows up and the political maneuvering is less interesting than the hordes of monsters and soldiers duking it out with each other. Fortunately enough, it does manage to pick itself up to throws everything and everyone into speculate of the grand finale. 
 
Characters 
 
Having nothing but character illustrations as their starting point, the production staff MAPPA have crafted some very lovable characters that are all distinct in their attributes and eccentric personalities. It's not all about the action as the main characters are given fleshed out  
backstorys and motivations rather than being  Amria is actually a very strong demonic melee fighter capable of tearing apart much larger monsters with ease but acts very much like a child in spite of her terrifying power and outward appearance. She is quite endearing and the focal point of which the show drives itself.  
 
Smitten by her looks and misguide notions, Kaisar Lidford is one the two bounty hunters accompanying Amria on her quest to reunite with her mother. A former knight that was disgraced, he still retains his code of honor in every fiber of his being and that extends to his fighting style, hair, and upkeep of his promises. He was overly the knight-in-shining-armor to a fault but I did warm up to him as the series went on as his character dynamics complement the other members of main cast.   
 
This brings me to my two favorite characters of Favaro Leone and Rita. To start off, Favaro is nothing like your conventional hero as his goal in life is to loudly indulge in life's guilty pleasures of women, money and booze while. As a red-headed bounty hunter, he is selfish, crass and utterly underhanded when it comes to fighting while wielding a revolver crossbow.  
 
How awesome is that?  
 
Equally fabulous is Rita, who joins up with the main cast a little further down the story. She may look like loli bait but never adheres to the stereotypical template that her appearance suggested. Her character interactions and contributions made the show that much more enjoyable on top of what was already offered.  
 
There is a myriad of other supporting characters from all the different race who don't really get or need character development but make the most of their limited screentime in just being plain awesome. Some standouts include Jeanne D'Arc of the humans, Bacchus, a god who manages the bounty system and Azazel of the demon faction.  
 
Visuals 
 
Animated by the Studio MAPPA, the very same team who created Kids on the Slope and Zankyou no Terror, the amount of quality put into this series places it among the best looking shows of the 2014 fall season. Drawing inspiration from Western fantasy aesthetics, the art style is atypical of the standard Japanese anime look and has that classic Dungeons and Dragons vibe to it. The attention to detail to the various locales and props really help immerse the audience into the world of  Rage of Bahamut: Genesis and that not even mentioning the stellar cinematography which lends itself to be more of a Hollywood film than standard anime show. There are small amounts of 3DCGI and for the most part, it looks all right as it doesn't distracts from the pretty 2D visuals.    
 
Sound 
 
Yoshihiro Ike, who scored the soundtrack to Ergo Proxy and Tiger and Bunny, comes in with a full orchestra and choir to deliver something that didn't really live up to the epic action on the screen. His work, by all means, was well-composed and of high quality but I couldn't help but feel that the music was rather uninspired  and lack the punch to bring the show to the next level. More specifically, it may be due to the lack of variety when it comes to just relying on strings and vocal as I found hard to recall anything memorable. Perhaps, if he had used more instruments in his ensemble, it would be an given the visuals the accompaniment and energy it deserves. In contrast, the opening credits, ""EXiSTENCE” performed by SiM, was one of my favorites of the fall season with it rock music and awkward Engrish. It does what every opening should do and that is to be extremely metal and awesome in priming the viewers for each weekly installment.  
 
Game Adaption 
 
If Studio MAPPA had the goal of making me try out whatever they were advertising for,  
 
they succeeded.    
 
Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was amazing enough that I simply wanted more and what better way to do so than to download the game it's based off of. However, upon seeing the chunky dated interface, confusing bland gameplay and obvious microtransactions, I promptly deleted it off my machine. I'm grateful that aspects of the trading card game were integrated quite well in the framework of the show of which was the bounty system and I never felt it was overbearing or obnoxious. It was just a small reminder of what the show's roots are and just how vastly difference they are in terms of quality.   
 
Conclusion  
 
Coming completely out of the left field, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is the surprise hit of the 2014 fall season. I simply cannot give enough praise to Studio MAPPA for their creativity and talent in creating a show that defies all expectations. There were a few small things that held it back from being a masterpiece, but nevertheless it was still one hell of a ride.  
 
Final Score: 8.5/10

    You know how some anime tend to make you smile? To make you laugh, or perhaps  make you cry instead? If an anime is well-writen and executed, it will at least induce a certain feeling. In another review I said that an anime made my heart cry. Clannad - After Story did not only that. It made it cry, commit suicide about 15 times, then tore itself up into pieces and glued itself back together. Needless to say, it was a rather painful experience, but I'm glad I sat through it till the end. 
 
After Story follows up on the first season of Clannad, but in overall, both seasons are completely different experiences. It involves two of the main characters from the first season, Tomoya and Nagisa, and their evergrowing relationship. At first you may think that the concept itself isn't very unique. But the way their relationship progresses is unlike any other regular anime, as your average high school anime tends to stop at the end of high school. After Story not only surpasses that, it brings us a well-written story of what happened to the two after their debut in the first season.  
 
The first season helped develop the overall story, shape the characters and their relationships and set the mood, and the second season uses this to its fullest potential by delivering a heartwarming and at the same time a heartbreaking experience, with its happy and sad moments. And when I say sad, I mean really sad, and this is accomplished by the overall character development. Thanks to the base the first season provided, you really feel with the people in After Story far more than you would in any other anime. But of course by getting along with the characters like that, the hardships they face have a much bigger impact than they normally would, and it is understandable if you have to take a (small) break from the anime when you can't bear it anymore. It can really be that sad. 
 
Now, this anime isn't a full-blown Slice of Life like it might sound. It really leans toward the super-natural phenomena the city our main characters live in experiences. In the first season, I didn't care so much about that, and focused more on the main character progression and such. But in the end, it played a rather important role in After Story, and without it, we would not have seen the hardships our couple go through in the anime, and teach them (and us) the lessons they've learned during that time. As long as something like this, the super-natural being an important part in an anime like this one, is done right, it really complements the overall feel and story of it, giving it an even more complete shape than it already had. 
 
The art is really great, with the characters looking either cool or quite cute. The overall color contrasts and lighting are amazingly executed, and it will always create the proper atmosphere for each scene. When a sad scene commences, the ambience, lighting, colors, even the art style will slightly change to maximize the experience we're seeing on screen. Often this will get to you in a way that you didn't expect, and if you notice the sides of your eyes getting a bit watery, it means it has done its job nicely. 
 
The music... Oh god, the music. There are songs in this anime that will get to you. Not just during the anime, but after you've watched the entire thing, whenever you hear one of the songs played in the show, and especially one in particular, you might have to cover your ears to prevent the memories from seeping in. The music is very well written, and really add to the overall atmosphere this anime has. I wouldn't say it's the best music I've ever heard, but I certainly wouldn't have wanted anything else than what it's got today. They did an amazing job composing the music so that it fits with the proper scenes, and once again will add to the sadness you'll be experiencing when it happens. 
 
As you may have noticed from my writing, do not watch Clannad and After Story if you have a weak heart, or overall prefer more happy and carefree anime like Lucky Star and Nichijou, and normally I would stick to those anime as well. But let me tell you this. Seldom has an anime moved me the way Clannad did, and I'm really glad I mustered up the courage to sit through it all. In the end, it left me with a satisfied feeling, with pretty much all the questions answered and all the loose ends tied. If you're a fan of anime in general, you should definitely watch this masterpiece. It might rip your heart apart, but it will probably feel like the best thing that has ever happened to you.

    MOD EDIT: Review contains spoilers 
 
I am so thankful for this OVA. While the last episode of Origination was utterly fantastic and had me on the brink of tears, this truly helped give me closure from the depression I felt immediately after finishing this incredible series – an extreme feeling of loss. I think one of the only problems I had with Aria as a series (and trust me when I say, it’s a very small problem) it’s that Alicia seemed TOO perfect, to the point where she was almost detached from everyone else. 
 
In every episode, she never showed fear or anxiety, anger or pain. And near the end of the series, when she dropped the bomb she was getting married, it seemed almost illogical, because if she was so close to Akari, why didn’t she ever tell her she was seeing someone? It’s funny, because I often wondered how it was possible guys never seemed to approach her. Then all of a sudden near the end, she’s not only been seeing someone, but she was ready to marry him! Why wasn’t he even mentioned? He should have played some part or at least been mentioned in my mind. 
 
That’s the only qualm I’ve ever had with this series: that Alicia didn’t seem to have full humanity – she was basically a goddess. But this OVA, I think, was meant to address this issue. She was sad when Grandma left and she was apprehensive about taking a student but she fell in love with Akari - truly in love as a sister - rather than as a watchful protector. And when you see this episode, you really feel a lot more strength when you think of the last episode of Origination, when Alicia visits Akari after retiring. Before, it felt like that visit would be one of just a handful and Alicia was gone pretty much for good, much like Grandma’s first student, who also married and moved away. But, with this episode, it was more and it really gave a finishing touch to Aria. You know that Alicia won’t be at Aria Company anymore, but she will always be nearby and Alicia and Akari will forever be the best of sisters and friends. 
 
This was fantastic and I would even go so far as to say it is impossible to appreciate the full breadth of this anime series without this last episode.

    This anime is what I call a true masterpiece.. Everything in toyko ghoul will either have you crying or have you gripping your pillows and grinding your teeth as you wait for the plot to unfold. Tokyo ghoul is pretty intense and and very sad, the main character goes through a lot and it's just out right fucked up what happens to him. This anime is very psychological so tread water carefully but in overall this anime is Fucking GOOD! The plot is twisted, the characters are very engaging, and the action in this anime is off the charts! All it have to say is be ready to join in a wild ride as you watch anime, and try not to become a ghoul yourselfs.

    I enjoyed the light hearted nature of the first season quite a bit. Characters had some slow (and basic) development, but the antics kept thing going at a good pace.  The entire story ended in a classic show down, which was completed with an open ended implication that the bad guy ""died"" but something appeared to have escaped the field of battle just afterwards.   Good set up for another season right?  
 
Wrong.  This season is just four episodes of blurry, low quality filler.   
 
The character's behaviors have been changed to fit into the stupid side story, and everything just seems to be put together for no rhyme or reason.  A jealous love triangle of side characters seems to make up the majority of the season, with silly events occurring that forces as much unnecessary character interaction as possible . 
 
It felt like I was watching a strange imitation of the original story.

    This is slated as romance-comedy, but it’s more comedy and slice of life. So the story begins with Sakura confessing her love to Nozaki and what happens then is a huge laugh. What happens after that is another huge laugh. Followed by another, and another. You get it. Even though the romance is almost non-existent on this one, when it happens, it's still cute enough to make your heart warm. Part of its appeal is how you're getting to know the characters, and how unexpected and quirky they are. I wouldn't feel right revealing too much for fear of taking away any potential enjoyment because it would be such a waste! There is no real development of plot or character, but even so, it still manages to steal your love. The entire entourage of Nozaki are so 4D and lovable, and situations are funny. Pokes fun at mangas even though it’s about a manga itself. The art fits the mood of the show so well- which just makes the already wonderful show even more wonderful. Though this isn't a serious show, it is seriously hilarious.

    I started to watch this anime with the anticipation that it would be a series I would enjoy. At the 'end' I am left with mixed feelings. 
 
To a certain point I was right, this was an anime I would enjoy. 
 
I watched the first arc, Sea of Shadow Arc, with great enjoyment. 
I did not expect such complexity, but found this fact to be true for the arc, in regards to it's plot and characters. As a viewer, the theme of an ordinary character finding themselves to serve higher purposes or be to special, is not uncommon- Juuni Kokuki does a splendid job in bringing it's own uniqueness to the theme. So much so, I did not feel it bored me in the least. The  portrayal of men and woman are different than most anime I have seen and that is an aspect I enjoyed. I also loved the characters that the series introduced to me. 
 
In the second arc, Sea of Wind Arc.  
I was again enjoying the direction of the story, even though the focus and direction of the anime shifted, it did not deter me in the least. I felt that at the end of this arc that I was left hanging, that in essence the ending was far too open-ended. The inconclusive ending of this arc effected my progress into the third arc, as it chilled my interest in the series- an unresolved ending isn't something I enjoy.  
 
I watched a couple episodes into the third Arc, then I began skipping through the episodes. It began to become slow for me as a viewer. It is hard to pin-point what was my tipping point; maybe I was uninterested because I still wanted the ending to the second arc.  
 
Regardless, I hoped that the third would pick up and skipped through a couple more episodes- if it was just a small spell of slowness, I would have continued watching, but there seemed to be no evidence that it would re-gain the life it once had.  
 
I stopped watching and I feel very disappointed.  
 
If I had one major criticism of this anime, it is the way that the story is split up, how often the focus changes, and the unresolved/open ended conclusion of the second arc.  
 
So I rate on the first two arcs, as I have only watched them in full.

    I know it seems lame to give something 10's across the board, but Hyouka left that kind of feeling with me. The anime summary was a deterrent for me at first as it makes it seem as though the entire anime is set with the one goal in mind. This only lasted a few episodes in though. If you enjoyed the Detective Conan series I would recommend this for a more casual ""slice of life + Mysteries"" feel. It kept me going throughout the series and the own downside is learning that the anime covered 4 out of 5 of the books covering the series.  
 
Pros: Artwork was crisp and clean. I understood what was what when and where. Unlike shows that skimp on things such as backgrounds and particular parts of characters during different scenes, I was in awe for this work. To be honest, I fell for Chitanda the first time she said ""I'm curious"" The artists put so much work into those eyes that it shook my core. Character design was great and I enjoyed the ""Happy ends"" to all of the mysteries. 
 
Cons: Story seems to drift off of the ""Mystery"" subject near the end of the show. It truly became a ""Slice of life"". Since spoilers are not allowed I can't delve too much into it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I for one would have preferred to end the series with a BANG! A big mystery that left room for a second season. (Though as previously stated this is not possible.) Some of the side characters are not given enough background, but again this is personal preference. If someone is going to show on screen for more than a single episode then the audience needs to feel as though everything is connected properly. I did not count this against the show since it was done so infrequently, but I still feel that it should be mentioned. 
 
Overall this just sums up the major points for me. Even though the Cons exist, I want to keep my rating 10/10. It has been many years since a show had me this hooked and it was over all too soon. I look forward to more work from this particular group and would happily recommend this to anyone.

What I praise today may lower itself on my list of favorites tomorrow. Please take this small post as nothing more and nothing less.)

    I never knew what Go was when I first started watching this. After I completed the series, that's all I wanted to do was play Go. This series goes very deep in the mind of the main character so much that you want to play against him just to see what he would do next.

    .Hack//Roots is not the first .Hack I've seen, as a matter of fact that honor goes to, .Hack//Legend of the Twilight, but Roots is still my favorite, or atleast it has that title since it's the only one I've finish as of my date posting this review. As I must be semi-professional, I should hurry and talk about the important stuff. Roots' biggest triumph, in my opinion, is it's characters. While I feel this had a much darker tone than Twilight, other than the depressing sister in a coma thing, Roots' character made the dark tone by their drama and interactions that inevitably either end in pain or false hope. I can't lie the fact that this one only lets up on it's dark tone a few times usually thanks to a select few of characters. Next, it's music was something that gained my fondness and was quickly added to my vast playlist. All and all I loved the anime because of how deep I felt it was and it's art to me was inspiring to see. Sadly I feel like I've been rambling, and should probably leave before I get PK'd. Well so long everybody!

    Usagi Drop is a very heart-warming story about a little girl (that is illegitimate) growing up with a new guardian who has zero parenting skills, after her real father dies. As the story progresses, this little girl presents many challenges that she receives for herself and her new parent. During a year of living in a new place, she shows so many cute sides of herself leaving me to wonder if being a parent is as great as it looks. 
 
Story 9/10 
This story is a very heart-warming one with a wonderful ending. The story at first starts out really slow and kind of boring, but after the first episode, things tend to pick up speed and progresses at a very good pace. Daikichi is presented with many challenges that every parent must face at one time or another and tries his hardest to be a good parent and a good friend. Rin finally gets to make friends and discover new things about life and slowly shows her personality to the people she has grown attached to. 
 
Character 10/10 
The supporting characters of this series are not very unique, but the main characters (Daikichi and Rin) do seem to have some originality. Unlike many other anime shows I've seen, Rin is actually portrayed as a very innocent child that gets frustrated and sometimes ashamed with growing up. Daikichi seems like a very boring and lazy guy, but is showing his good will and good character by sacrificing more for Rin than he originally thought he would. 
 
Art 8/10 
I was  very impressed with the art and  liked how they tended to use two different art styles. In the beginning of each episode the style reminds me of what people would use when trying to convey a flashback or memory, while the rest of the episode is another more defined style. 
 
The art style all together feels very nostalgic of what anime shows in the 80's and 90's had. 
 
Sound 9/10 
The music in the show is just spectacular. It is what makes this anime, not just a show, but a piece of art. 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
I couldn't get enough of the cute situations that Rin was always showing. It really makes me wish that I had a six year old kid. This is something I probably won't forget and I wish there were more than just 11 episodes. I hope there will be another season.

    Often I thought to myself, why bother watching a show with an overpowered protagonist. I thought that those kind of stories lack any kind of tension. This show has not one but two of that kind and it doesn't even hide this at all. But why do so many people enjoy said ho nonetheless? That a the mindset I went into the series and it answered that question for me and even more became one of my favorite anime to date. So I decided to bring my experiences No Game No Life brought to me on this platform. 
 
Story(8/10): 
 
First of all the story is pretty solid but not really the most orginal..It's heart lies in the games presented that are for the most part pretty creative. Other than that regard it is a typical isekai. But even though it is not a special story structure, it is delivered pretty good. The first episode explains almost everything you need and that without getting boring or repetitive. And the rest is just building up to a greater conflict. With all that said the story isn't it's strongest point but enjoyable nevertheless. 
 
Art(10/10): 
 
One of the strongest points of the anime. The Art is extremely amazing. You have vivid colors, strong character designs(like expected from a harem anime), and the style even changes based on the protagonists mood what i personally love. Madhouse has done an amazing job in designing  the artstyle. 
 
Sound(8/10) 
 
The sound design is a more of mixed bag for me.On the one hand No Game No Life has many rather forgetable soundtrack but on the other hand this anime has one ofthe greatest songs i've ever heard in an ost on it's roster in kings game. And the Op is one of my favorite songs I have ever heard. The Ed is pretty decent too. In the end the emotional impact from the few very good songs saves it in this category. 
 
Character(9/10):  
 
Like I said normally I am not the biggest fan of Overpowered mcs but I love Sora and Shiro, especially Sora. They both are the strongest together. I love their dynamic as blank. I love Soras genius mind in terms of strategy. But the harem... I the rest of the cast is also pretty likeable. The in comparison rather dumb dora that is not really  socially awkward unlike blank and the psycho that is jibril. It is a bit of a shame that clammy and feel don't get much screentime as of now.  
 
Enjoyment(10/10): 
 
This Anime is pure fun and I myself love it because of the creative games as I am a big enthusiast of board and card games myself. I love the mindgames that are present in the series for that reason. It is one of the most enjoyable anime for me just because it is fun. Even though you know that blank will win it all, the fun comes from ho they will win, how will they outsmart their opponents. The enjoyment comes from the journey not from the result.  
 
Overall(10/10):  
 
Objectively it shouldn't be a 10 out of 10 if you calculate the numbers from above together but screw it. I love this Anime on every aspect, so the 10/10 is more of a subjective rating. I love everything from this Anime, the concept with the games, the fantastic surreal vivd artwork presented, the mindgames in every game, the intensity in every game, the song kings game that sends a chill down my spine every time I hear it, the opening that I saved on my playlist on youtube, the comedic scenes, the ecchi( even though it can  be to much at times in NGNL), the references to other works etc. It is not a deep or philosphical anime so if you search for something like that than don't bother try it. NGNL is just conveying one big message:  
 
Commandment 10: Let's all have fun together. 
 
Now that I'm finished thank you for reading my first review. I am not a native speaker so sorry for some obvious mistakes(if there are any).

    Just watched the second episode of the anime, and here is what I can say: 
 
What I like best about this anime is it's originality. It is an interesting idea of using the plots of the worldwide known tales and fables, even though it could sound like a re-post, there are many parodies of such. But here it adds additional shine and depth to the personalities of different characters and makes it easier to follow. Thanks to this, they don't even need to use a whole episode to introduce each character - it's not hard to remember everyone of them - and the whole team acts together straight from the beginning, which doesn't happen often. 
 
The eyesight-fearful ""Hunter"" is considered by me as a rather rare personality, and with his awesome, I could even say cute ending ~su, he truly is something worth of mentioning. 
 
The second part of it's originality is difficult to get used to. The ""storyteller"" (those who have seen Railgun can say it's Kuroko, Misaka's roommate from the Railgun anime) tends to speak over the speeches of the main characters. I just can't get it over with, and so I watch the scene again, until I've heard both the storyteller and the characters talk (in my case I mean until I've read all the subtitles). And the main thing is, usually both of them are of none importance to me. While I've already noticed the things the storyteller explains, the main characters have a simple chat. So, don't get confused by overhearing something and move on. And remember the texts from Bakemonogatari, which are also not intended to be read properly. 
 
What comes to the real plot, it has nothing special. A team of students with different specializations solving things, with a little love-comedy in it, a strong girl on the outside but soft in the inside an so on. And it doesn't seem it'll get better than that. 
 
But due to the great characters, I think I'll watch on. And this is not a bad anime, no. But quite far from a masterpiece. For those who want masterpieces, watch Beck and Phantom first.

    I usually have a problem finishing Anime. Psycho-Pass was one of the rare exceptions to this. Once it got going, I was hooked. The art style is beautiful. The plot was so absurd that at certain points I had to really think about what just happened. Long story short, I highly recommend Psycho-Pass as it excels in many different ways. Just prepare to get out the kleenex. I'm not positive how others feel about it, but I was left with a bitter taste once I saw the anime was coming to an end. But with the news of a Season 2, there is hope. Watch this anime!

    I'm not really going to go in-depth with this review. All I have to say is that the story was really choppy and jumpy. It barely qualified as a Shounen-ai. The fight scenes were a joke, and the dialogue was terrible. It was so cheesy and unoriginal. If you're into all that, then that's fine, but even then, I think that it would make more sense if you played or know about the game.

    While going through a sports anime kick I stumblked onto this amazing gem. While it shares a lot of themes in common with other sports anime series, I feel that the characters in this series really help it stand apart from so many others. Going in I knew nothing about volleyball, so if you don't either don't worry. You will learn a lot which helps you to understand and grow to love the characters even more. I did talk to friends of mine who did play volleyball on a team in school and they said it was very accurate. This recieves so much love from me and I have definitely watched it multiple times. The manga is amazing as well, so if you get to the end of season one and need more I suggest checking out the manga. All in all, this series will latch onto your heart and leaving waiting for season 2.

       This anime is incredible, it manages to combine comedy and hentai in a sublime way. 
   Not to mention that the scenes that are comedy are very funny and those of hentai are quite ""hot."" 
   So overall it's a great anime that I highly expect a sequel. 
   If any lolicom like me want an anime hentai of loli amazing I really recommend this anime. 
   However, there is not much to talk about (I'm still writing because MAL does not allow analysis to be short). 
Hm ... ah, yes, I almost forgot to talk about animation / anime art, she's pretty normail, how can I say ... satisfactory.

    Something that for some reason does really make me frustrated, is well-done job that could have been even better with just a little more effort and common sense (call me a perfectionist if you want). This series is an example of what I'm talking about. 
 
Scrapped Princess presents an outstanding setting and plot, mixing both fantasy and sci-fiction in such a harmonic manner (as the writer Arthur Clarke says in one of his laws: any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic). The way in which the medieval scenario gradually turns into a post-apocalyptic world really gives a particular, immersive and surprising atmosphere to the show, being that accompanied by a complex and deep questioning that becomes the focus of the plot: Should people be free to make their own decisions, even if they could harm themselves? Or should they be protected from the risk of destruction, even at the cost of taking away their freedom and keep them into ignorance? This issue invites the viewer to meditate through the reflecting that the very characters perform. 
 
As for what respects to these characters, practically all the cast is remarkably well designed. They have properly defined personalities, their own motivations, have dinamic and organic interactions, and do make the plot to keep moving in the right direction. Practically all of the cast... except for a couple exceptions. One of them: the protagonist. On one hand, Pacifica's personality does fit to the philosophical approach of the story, since her spoiled, carefree and passive attitude is frequently  criticized by other characters, and she actually deliberates about the rightness or wrongness with her behaviour and with some of the events that sorround her path. The problem is that, despite all this pondering, she takes her passiveness to the extreme, literally making no decisions and doing nothing significant (at least not voluntarily) until the very conclusion. Damn, more than not being interested in her sorroundings, sometimes it looks like she has some kind of autism since she doesn't seem to figure out a lot of what's happening around her, even when told explicitly by other characters; the protagonist being this bland is truly a blow below the belt for the series. Then there's also one character that only appears for an unnecessary arc as an important individual in more than one sense, and once this couple of episodes are over, not only you don't see him anymore but also he didn't serve any long term purpose. I had to highlight this because, although this is a personal approach, he looked like a simple tool for mommentary emotional manipulation. 
 
The aforementioned arc isn't the only flaw on the storytelling, though. Even if the passing is really good and most events happen in a surprising, yet coherent and catchy way, several minor holes acumulate until they get weighty. Some things are never explained while in counterpart many issues are exposed with excessive detail and in several times, which can make the narrative dense at some points. These matters make, along with Pacifica, an actual Achilles' heel that deprives Scrapped Princess to reach its full potential (which, in case I didn't manage to make my point until now, was huge). 
 
In compensation for the previously mentioned, everything referred to the artwork is just impressive for the time this series was aired. Animation has a great use of colour for every situation, a truly high level of detail (both for characters and for environments and backgrounds) and action is performed very well. As for the soundtrack, it is in my opinion, one of the best I have ever heard. Every track has a lot of strenght and fits perfectly every scene, making drama and action really intentse and also contributing to the series' identity. 
 
With a better execution, it could have reached way more than 7/10.

    First thing in my mind is 'it will well to watch' since I really hooked with the theme and seiyuu, (well main seiyuu is Kamiyan). Enjoying first and second episode, but in the third episode I didn't really know, why I have the imoutou of protagonist. And after looking for 5 episodes, I dropped it. 
 
I hyped because the theme is 'otaku's genius' and saw first episode was epic. But next story just so bland. I don't know because it's seiyuu, since I know that Rena Matsui was graduated member of idol, or just me because my preference. 
 
I hope in the next work, they can upgrade it well.

    Nisekoi, this title makes me wonder, was my love for Nisekoi: fake, or was it not? Well surely it cannot be fake, right? 
 
Before I continue on, if you want a more in depth review then you may skip this read. I will also assume you have watched AT LEAST the first season of this show, and know a little bit of base knowledge for this season so I can ""spoil"" some of the more obvious stuff. 
For those of you who take the time to read this, thank you.  
 
Story 4/10 (Let's dive right into it~) 
""Raku and the girls are back! The hunt for the key to his heart and locket continues in the second season of this fan favorite anime series."" This was the synopsis, or the outline/summary/plot of the anime that they seem to tell you. But in all seriousness, there really wasn't much to do with the key and the locket in this season. Sure the characters who have a key tell you how they feel, and sure they talk about it, they just don't really capitalize on this point. Which, was a major flaw, and the synopsis sort of, well got my hopes up. The story/plot in this season merely turned into a love fest of needy girls. And the filler episode, just sort of destroyed me, I was not into that episode at all. 
The story wasn't much of a story in this season, I mean they did make progress it was just sort of awkward to react to. When I say, ""make progress"" I meant, ""almost no progress."" 
Sure some episodes were sweet and heart warming, but mean while, others just didn't feel necessary. Overall I was ready for the worst, but really anticipating the best. Story wise I was let down. (Disappointment...) 
 
Art 7/10  
I'm not usually too picky when it comes to art. For Nisekoi I'm not that dazzled, but I do have to say that the very bright colorful, in your face color palette was good. The animation was pretty good, I've definitely seen animation like this before. 
Nothing that outstanding, but something I liked. 
 
Sound 8/10 
I'm also usually not that picky when it comes to sound either. There are a few points that I'm looking for though, like having a nice opening/openings and nice closing/closings. In the first season of Nisekoi I was truly amazed, I fell in love with pretty much every opening and closing that it had to offer. For the second season, that wasn't the case. Still, the sound track was still quite good, and it fit the anime well. Same with the voice acting, all the voices are pretty spot on, I enjoyed listening to them.  
In all seriousness the sound is probably the highlight of Nisekoi: .  
 
Character 5/10 
When I watch Nisekoi, I love watching for the characters. They aren't THAT unique, but they all have their weirdness's to them, which I adore. When it came to Nisekoi: I felt like they didn't stick true to how the characters were in the first season. Of course, you do have to take to account how the characters feel/act around the MC, after the events of season 1. Which does change how the characters are in Nisekoi: quite dramatically, which was ""meh"" to me. 
While the characters did change, most of them had very little progress made in terms of story. I feel like the show sort of denied progress for characters who needed it, and let characters who didn't need it, get it. They added in some new characters to this season, which I didn't mind, but having characters sort of just ""being there"" can just be a waste of time. Overall most characters barely made any development and the characters became sort of predictable, and bland. Bland because they sort of just do the same thing or act the same way over and over and over again.  
 
Enjoyment 6/10 
I fairly enjoyed Nisekoi:. Once I realized that the show was going to focus more on the character aspect more than the story aspect I sort of realized that I should just enjoy it on how it is. Of course story plays a huge part on enjoyment for me. So when you start to stray from that I also start to stray from that, meaning I end up not focusing on it too much since I know i'll just get my hopes up. Overall my enjoyment was purely based on the characters, sound and art. (Which can be a good thing, but at the same time also a bad thing.)  
 
Final Verdict 5/10 
When people say, Nisekoi should be enjoyed for how it is, it should be, I do not disagree on this point. I do agree with people who say, well this season made me sad, since it did make me sad. I was sooooooooooo, disappointed. The quality just dropped, you know when people say, it went ""0 to 60 in 2 seconds!"" That's sort of how it was for me, except it went from 0 to 60 then steadily back to 0 in a few episodes. The 0 to 60 was season 1, and then the drop to 0 was season 2.  
I recommend this to those of you who want laughs, since this series is just funny. But beware that this season of Nisekoi can be highly disappointing, and well just not that good.

    ""Improved ecchi sequel to an Buddhism-ecchi series"" 
 
Just like its predecessor, Buddhism is still the key factor in Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!!. As stated from my previous review on the prequel, having knowledge about Buddhism will be of great help in understanding the story. The anime clarifies many issues that surfaced in Amaenaide yo! (ie. who were those suspicious looking monks, why does Ikkou have such tremendous power, and who was the monk eating ice cream with Jotoku baa etc.). Of course it is absolutely recommended to finish Amaenaide yo! before watching the sequel! 
 
Similar to the first season, Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! is also very episodic. Thus one can literally jump around watching the episodes in different orders and still won't be confused with the overall storyline (not recommended though). However, unlike the random day-to-day events from the first season, this time the show focus on how the girls harness and master their powers while at the same time aid Ikkou to better understand his unique talent. The overall story gets a bit more complicated than the first season as to be expect due to uncovering the mysteries from before, but it still remains easy to comprehend nonetheless. 
 
The animation quality is similar to the previous season. For those who are familiar with the producer, Studio DEEN (products include:  
Fate/stay night, Rurouni Kenshin,   
Vampire Knight, and the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni series) has a pretty good reputation for its high level animation quality. 
 
Many types of ecchi scenes made their way to the screen in this sequel (there's even one involving DOGS o.0). Most of these scenes does not really contribute much to the story, but as weird as it may sound, some of these ecchi scenes does help act as stepping stones for the character developments. 
 
Beside a slightly better OP and ED, everything else is pretty much a recycle of the previous season (ie. not bad). There were no changes to the voice actors role as well so everything should be pretty standard for those who have already seen the first season (which everyone should do before watching Katsu!!) 
 
The addition of the uber ""kawaii"" Kazuki Kazusano to Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! really made this sequel much more interesting to watch as a whole. Voiced by Asami Sanada, Kazuki, the antagonist of the show, really brought the ecchiness to a whole new level (not quite the level of Kanokon, but quite close).  
 
Additionally, the original casts also have further character developments (which was extremely lacking in the previous season). Many of their secret pasts have been revealed along with their reasons to becoming a nun/monk. While there are still plenty of room for improvement in this department, overall I feel the production crew have done a much better job for this season. 
 
Seeing how the manga is still publishing, there is quite a high chance that someday we will be hearing more from this series. For a one season anime (two if you count Amaenaide yo!), the show is entertaining enough to make you ""marathon"" the anime in one go. If you like ecchi anime then you would not want to miss this! Mata joudo!

    A very pretty and detailed OVA but the plot is too disjointed and confusing. 
 
PLOT: I liked the premise of the plot and the setting of the action, but felt that the execution could have been much better. The scripting just feels random and it's almost like there are huge chunks of exposition cut from the final edit. I did like the realistic approach to warfare and the fact that there is no mecha – its all fighter jets, but I did feel that they went overboard with the techno-jargon as all that just went straight over my head! The central characters are no where near well developed enough, a bit of backstory on Jack and Rei would have been nice – but considering this is a 5 episode OVA with a massive cast they have done quite well in the character development department. My corrupted brain decided that there was definitely some BL undertones in the relationship between Jack & Rei, and it really wanted some sort of confirmation of that…….but that’s probably just me! The aliens could have done with a bit of development as well, as it is they remain as mysterious at the end as they were at the start. But all in all for a short OVA series the plot was interesting, if not solely there to link together the fabulous battle scenes. 
 
ANIMATION: The animation in this is absolutely 1st class! Wonderful use of CGI throughout great detailing in the backgrounds, well executed and choreographed fight scenes and attractive character designs. Lots of colour – loved the green skies of the planet Fairy (kind of had DBZ Namek flashbacks though) and the colour displays of the JAM aircraft – it’s all very visually appealing and most of my enjoyment of the series stemmed from the brilliant graphics. 
 
MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: I did not like the OP at all – seemed very discordant and random on the ear. Also the ED was a decent track but didn’t seem to fit with the tone of the show, as it is a bit too upbeat. The BGM was excellent though. Voice acting is quite solid, although Rei is a wee bit too soft spoken and depressed sounding, to extent he comes across as extremely emo. 
 
Overall a solid OVA that has excellent graphics and an interesting plot, but suffers from bad pacing and a confusing structure. This may have worked better if it was fleshed out more as a longer series or if it had of been trimmed right back to movie length.

    I started watching part of the first episode back in 2016 so this was an anime that was placed on-hold in my list. But why? Well because back then, I was still new to the anime industry and wasn't really interested yet in Slice of Life, Comedy genres. But I actually regret that I did that cause I missed out on the good laughs that I just had revisiting this later in 2018. Now I am really happy that I finished watching this show.  
 
If you expected that this was a Shoujo anime because of its title, don't worry I expected that too at first. Actually, it is not even though the main character is the girl. Although there might be a few elements that makes this anime qualify as shoujo, still it is enjoyable for all genders so don't be afraid and watch this cause you'll be in for a good laugh. Starting with the story, I am pleased about the uniqueness of this series. The story is progressive and if there are some unexplained parts yet, there are flashbacks that will be shown for the audience to catch up with the plot. The main attraction of the show would be its comic relief essence. Well actually, this show has more comedy than it has romance to be honest. I can't remember how many times I laughed my arse off from the intense comedy that this show has. The art style is really beautiful and it might make you fall in love with it and it is one of the good points of this show. The soundtrack.. I really liked the opening and it shows the personalities of the characters very well during the sequence. No spoilers on it and that's a good thing unlike most opening sequences out there. The characters... you would not believe how dense the main characters are.. probably denser than osmium or any other element. But.. they have great development though so that makes up for the negative things. However, their density leads to comic relief scenes so maybe that's the point. I enjoyed this show really well and I regret that I didn't see this sooner but there's just this one thing that I have insights on. Things didn't fully worked out in the end so... will there be a season 2?

    The idea in which equating popularity to greatness is disappointingly common in our modern world. Many people will claim that 50 Shades of Gray is high quality literature and many others will consider Drake to be a great rapper. They are blinded by the delusion that something being popular automatically makes it good. Obviously those people have never looked further into the media that they claim to be an aficionado of and have never read Infinite Jest or listened to Yung Lean before. This leads to Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, an unfortunately overlooked show in the Fall 2014 season. It did not stand out and the publicity was nearly nonexistent. However, if you were one of the people who decided to give the show a try, you were in for quite a treat. You would have experienced a coherent plot, enjoyable characters, entertaining drama, and an overall comfy feeling that viewers have not experienced since Non Non Biyori last Fall. The fact that people would rather discuss popular, yet mediocre shows is downright depressing. It brings back bad memories of last Summer when a terrible Adam Sandler movie beat out Pacific Rim in the box office for that weekend. Regardless, those of you who overlooked this show have a chance to redeem yourself if you change your ways and look to the less popular and more obscure things in life. Following that ideal will take lead you closer to the path of enlightenment. 
 
The overall story for Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was nothing extraordinary or groundbreaking. It compares to other typical club-type shows where you find both drama and comedy as the main ideas. A word that would describe the story would be “unoffensive”. It was rather soothing and made the viewer feel comfortable when watching it. The overall arching plot was a typical slice of life show with a bit of a supernatural twist added in, but that is once again typical for this genre of visual novel from which the show was adapted from. The story itself could have been more fleshed out, but that would not have been easily done with the time constraints of a 1 cour show. The pacing was also quite well done, it did not drag or feel boring at any time and gave the viewer a relaxed or comforting experience. The fact that the show was adapted from a visual and had such a comforting feel to it is rather unique. Many times visual novel adaptions are rather fanservice driven or focus mainly on the exciting action related parts of the game. That being said, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was not without fanservice (it had plenty), it just came off in a bit more subdued and enjoyable than the typical smut that you would expect to see. It did not feel out of place or forced into the story to sell more Blu Rays, it just had an overall natural feel due to how the story was told and how it was directed. 
 
One aspect of this show that was rather interesting was the studio choice. Many people will remember Hoods Entertainment as a studio that did some of the most obscene fanservice shows that have aired on regular television. However, it seems that they have turned over a new leaf since their latest projects have not been lewd at all. It is a strange change of pace to go from doing Manyuu Hikenchou or Seikon no Qwaser which were over the top in terms of smut to the rather tame and pedestrian shows that they have done in recent history. Regardless, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was a rather pleasant show to look at. It featured a pastel color theme and the overall quality of the show was relatively high. Once again, the term that describes it best is “unoffensive”. That would also describe the sound for the show. The voice actors used were the same from the game which are commonly heard in visual novels. Experienced viewers will recognize a few voices, especially if they read visual novels. Regardless, the voice acting was well done and felt natural for the show. The OST and sound direction was also perfectly acceptable, it had that typical visual novel flair to it which fit the mood of the show perfectly. It definitely added to the comfortable feel that the show gave off. 
 
In regards to characters, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai did not feature anything special in particular. The cast was composed of rather cut and paste type characters with various back stories to give them some sort of depth. Obviously, the anime viewer would not see their full stories since it is not the original source material in which the reader would go through an entire route dedicated to all of the main characters, but it was easy to pick up on the various drama points and other traits from what was shown. However, what stood out for this show was the character interaction. That was top notch and it really felt like the characters had chemistry with each other. It was incredibly well done for this type of show and it really made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. 
 
When looking at the complete package of Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, it is hard to consider it to be anything but enjoyable. The fact that it was one of the least popular and overlooked shows for the Fall 2014 season is rather disappointing. However, that may be for the better. The discussion and subsequent translation project for the visual novel were in part done due to the smaller and tight knit community that enjoyed watching this show. Regardless, if you are looking for something enjoyable that you can sit back and relax to, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai would be an excellent choice. It goes to show that it does not matter if something is relatively overlooked, it could end up being better than many high profile options. That being said, the moral of this review is look in unlikely places and you will find true hidden gems. Worshiping nothing but mainstream media is a terrible habit and you should try to think outside the box more often. Once you do, you can appreciate more things and even find enjoyable stories in unlikely places. Or in terms more suited to Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, don't judge a book by its cover.

    For those of you who haven't finished watching the first season..watch that first and come back and watch the second season. That way the story wll connect together and piece itself quite easily. (just a friendly reminder)! 
 
Shakugan no Shana II is a great anime to watch for those who wants action and some romance combined with it. Story revolves around the main characters Yuji, who is the male protagonist and is also the central character for the story's development. He is a Mystes, a dead sentient being who is kept alive with the power of existence (flame of life). He is also the most unusual of the characters (this is due to the special artifact inside him, the reiji maigo that replenishes his power of existence every midnight). With this ability he can rejuvenate his life-force, and still live as an ordinary citizen though he is actually dead in real-life.  
 
Shana, the female protagonist is also the main lead of the story and a kick-ass flame haze. (Flame Hazes are powerful individuals who work under a secretive organization known as &quot;Outlaw,&quot; and the flame hazes' duty is to keep the world in balance by making sure powers of existence are still existent on the planet.) She is a powerful fighter who wields a flame sword (nietono no shana). FYI: Shana was named after her sword by Yuji. Her job is to fulfill her duties as a flame haze while protecting Yuji, the bearer of the reiji maigo, although it is revealed she is harboring strong conceptual feelings for him later in the story. (Romance kicks in)!  
 
Story: 8/10  
 
Not a bad story, but needs more development in the central plot. It seemed very rushed at certain points of the episodes, but decent storyline was put in play. 
 
Art: 9/10 
 
Nicely done artwork. Its not too heavily pixelated but the characters had some i guess watercolored features which is actually good because it provides deeper textures in the background of the city and the environment. Characters looked very traditional, and fashioned with good works of art. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
 
This is where Shakugan no Shana deserves the praise and admonition as an anime series!! Songs are performed by Japanese band artist Mami Kawada, and her songs are killer-good! EX: Hishoku no Sora (intro song)-this was intro from first season, Triangle, and Joint from second season ending theme song. All songs performed by Mami Kawada. Perfect 10/10 for masterpiece in soundtrack! 
 
Characters: 10/10 
 
This falls somewhat in the category of the artwork I described, but the characters overall in general have great features. Characters voice acting was performed well, and many of them had loveable personalities/characteristics. The only character I found irritating was that annoying, obnoxious nutty professor who always seems to get his plans ruined by the flame hazes. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
I loved it. It was similar to my enjoyment of Fate Stay Night, but nowhere as near as good. Gets a 10 for satisfaction for viewer audience, and the rewatch value I'd have to say is pretty high in my books. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
Great anime series! Enjoyable, loveable, everything in between!

    BTOOOM!, a name you may have heard before, and might have remembered because of how strange of a name it really is. BTOOOM! is an exciting show, to say the least. However, like every other show of it's kind, there will be flaws. These flaws may be based on preference, however most are logical flaws that I will soon point out. Let it also be known that there will be praise involved as well. And so It begins.  
 
Story - 7 
 
BTOOOM! caters to the audience that you would expect most anime watchers to be- nerd like kids to adults who spend most of their day on the internet, and mainly playing games. You could also say that it attempts to side with viewers whom are NEET, or those who are young and Not in Education, Employment, or Training. I give this show props for not having players sucked into the BTOOOM! game, like the well known Sword Art Online, but rather sent to a real life replica of it, and expected to kill other 'players' in order to go home. The situation of them being sent is a bit realistic, since the US Army has scouted top ranked shooting game players before. However, there is a giant thing I have wrong with this. If you throw 30 gamers onto an island with a bunch of bombs, do you think they would actually run around and kill each other? If they truly are such gamers to a large extent, they will most likely have no physical endurance or strength what-so-ever, nor the will to kill another human being. That is for most, anyway. There are many things I can argue with the story line, but it's at least a little good. 
 
Art - 9 
 
I was actually very surprised at how nice the art for this series was. It was mainly very fluid and pleasant to look at, especially the semi-realism take. I have to say, their eyes were gorgeous. Actually, all of the character art and animations were lovely. The show handled nature and explosions relatively well, which is definitely good because those are two things we see very often. The bad parts of the art would be when we see people from a distance, as with most anime. However, you can't say that every anime has blob faced people at a distance, because there are some out there that actually put in the time. Despite this, I'm quite happy with the art. The opening and closing arts were nice, even if the ending song's art was just some pretty pictures panning across the screen. 
 
Sound - 7 
 
This is the one section that is purely based on preference. I just have to say that I love Nano, and she is the one who did the opening for BTOOOM!. The opening does get you hyped for the episode to start, which is what themes are mainly for. The ending song didn't really stand out much to me, so I don't have any comments on it. I watched the sub, and it was good in my opinion. I've never exactly heard a 'bad' japanese dub before, except for Elfen Lied. I'm sure there are more out there, but I probably haven't seen them. None of the background tracks really stood out much, which is why this section has a 7 from me. 
 
Characters - 6 
 
The characters in this series were okay at best. Let's look at the two main characters. 
 
Ryota Sakamoto - Male protagonist 
 
Sakamoto is, how do you put it, kind of weak? You always want your main character to be strong and cool, but this guy took 10 minutes of an episode trying to figure out how a BIM (bomb) works, when he had the most basic type. Not to mention, he's supposedly on the top 10 leaderboard for the game BTOOOM!? I get that the whole situation was a shock, but you would think he would know. His character design reminded me a lot of Light Yagami from Death Note, which puts it out there that his design wasn't exactly very unique. He wasn't completely spineless, and wasn't dumb the whole way through either. He just could have been smarter. 
 
Himiko - Female protagonist  
 
Not the only girl in the show, but every guy seems to think she is, since they all try something nasty with her at some point or another. She didn't get in the way enough for me to hate her, and even though she had serious trust issues with men, she had a right to. Her character design is basic. The only thing that makes her unique is that her eyes are way too far apart. The fact that her and Sakamoto were married in game was a bit.. cringe worthy. It just reminded me of those 10 year olds that get married in Minecraft. I have an issue with how everything about her is very sexual. Like how she has super big boobs and has gotten sexually assaulted way too many times. Her personality isn't bad, just how the story treats her. 
 
There are characters I love (the psycho kid) and characters I hate (the fat guy), as with every show. These feelings are at extremes, though. Short rant: why do all of the men have to be disgusting pigs in this show? It is just way too obvious that whoever wrote the story for this strongly disliked men in everything they do. 
 
Personal enjoyment - 6 
 
This anime was fun to watch, but there were times where I was questioning everything about it. It made me mad, happy, all of the above. When I finished, I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. The ending was bad, which probably didn't help. Watching any survival show is fun, though, no matter how bullshit it is. 
 
Overall - 7 
 
It was good, but definitely no masterpiece. It had many flaws. This reaction could also be partly because of the fact that it didn't wrap up in a neat little bow like we all would like. I would say to watch it and form your own opinion of it. You may love it, but you may hate it. Maybe the manga is better. I haven't read enough to differentiate the two. If you find yourself okay in dealing with what I've criticized, go ahead and enjoy yourself!  
 
Thank you for reading!

    This is an epic story that is beautifully drawn and designed.  It is very dark and more than a little depressing, but mostly it is emotionally involving.   
 
There are a lot of anime characters whom I could calmly watch being dismembered -- because I don't care about them.  But the characters in Gilgamesh are emotionally engaging.  I believed in their stories, and when they felt pain, it was a big deal to me. 
 
In feel, it's a bit like Texhnolyze.  Ergo Proxy has some mood similarities but is a very different show.   
 
In visual style, few shows come close.  Perhaps Witch Hunter Robin is a rival for visual beauty.

    For Scifi-fan myself, I want to write a review focus more on it. 
This review still got spoiler, though I try my best not to. 
 
Story:  
A very boy meet a cute princess form underground at a fate encounter, they create a bond that connect them to another level, lead them to the adventure that no one knew before. 
 
Art: 
Work outstanding with this genre (and situation), rolate and rolate, sometime you could be confused and lost the balance , like you dont know where the ground, where the sky. 
 
Sound: 
OST is not very good but BGM is absolute amazing, delivered the feel and make atmosphere more intense. 
Voice actor is out of my range, for a outsider like me, it's fine. 
 
Character: 
A boy lost something very important, then become lonely cause social around him. A girl ""brave on outside"" sure get along well cause she lost too. They build up relationship through sympathy. After lost contact, he come to realize that he dont want to lost this girl. 
Character sure are simple, and expose very clear in movie. However the villain somehow show that he want to be picked by ""inverted people"" and somekind of want it for him only . 
 
Enjoyment: 
Super. Not a minute I leave my eye out of my monitor. My heart tumble and my mind keep yelling ""I want to know more"". well, Sci-fi fan. But the ending leave me confusing and not want to accept it's ending. 
(Though I know sci-fi always do that, solve one case and open a f**king greater case, it's not like it left a bad taste in my mount or something) 
 
Overall: 
Sure a fascinating drive for me, for all the fantasy, thrill and fun adventure. However I like to know moreeee. 
Let me assume some not-good thing: ending, ost, character. 
So watch it if you haven't, watch it if you are into sci-fi genre, watch it if you have not been into sci-fi genre, just watch it like there's no tomorrow. 
*but at some point, I do satisfy with the end of villain. 
**Overall maybe a little high. But 8.6 should be 9, isn't it?

    &quot;Always My Santa!&quot; is an odd duck of an Anime if there ever was one, thats for sure. Starting with the story then. In some respects, its a standard romance and is handled well by Akamatsu-sensei, as usual. There are some odd elements to the story as well though, the magic and Santa Claus and how that all works together. In that respect, it feels like the audience is only witnessing a small piece of a larger story. That being said, however, it doesn't complete mar the experience, one just feels as though these are just two episodes of a larger series - and they are not. Further enhancing this sensation is the shear speed at which the plot seems to move - seems like the whole mess is on fast-forward. Overall, it feels like these two OVA episodes are a condensation of a long manga or somesuch. There are some comedic touches at play here, typical for Akamatsu-sensei, and mostly the comedy works well, for what there is. However, the primary showcase here is the romance drama - and there is it. Because of the show's frantic pacing, or perhaps despite it, there is a great deal of monologue-ing going on. While this does heighten the tensity of the drama, I do feel that it detracts from the feature in way. That is, long sequences of a character chattering to herself are not exactly exciting. I can't help but think that if the OVA was a little longer, the characters could gab to themselves less and the feature whould be enlivened somehow. The magic and transformation sequences, while the source of comedy and nudity, seem a little out of place at times. In the large part, this OVA shades on the more dramatic and serious side so the magic and, especially, the transformation sequence seem to not really match the whole (admitted entertainment value notwithstanding). The art is standard Akamatsu fare here, and looks good for all that - clean and nice. The characters look good, if not familiar in some respects. I think the art style here is closer to Negima than Love Hina, if I may say so. The music is an interesting element in this OVA, as well. Nice, if slightly bland, pop tunes and light instrumental themes that work well but don't quite function in the OVA itself. One gets the impression that the soundtrack whould be nice to own and listen to in isolation from the OVA, but it doesn't quite work in the animation. It always seems like the music is being talked over or otherwise not meshing properly. So while the music itself is pretty good, putting it in the OVA how it was is a small misstep. The characters are very standard, in large part - nothing too unusual or unexpected, actually. This is both good and bad. As an admitted fan of Akamatsu-sensei, the character designs are enjoyable to me, others may find them to be a retread though (as they are to some extent). Thankfully, no characters stand out as particularly irritating. This is an enjoyable OVA in spite of its flaws. Its unfortunate that there isn't more of it.

    Kuroko no Basket is one of the shows that one can't criticize easily ,it was  very interesting . i really enjoyed the exciting moments throughout the anime  
 
Story: 9 
 
the story has progressed since first season with the appearance  of the rest of the generation of miracles and it was progressing with a relatively fast pace . 
 
Art: 9 
 
The Art was beautiful. I give credits to the studio to be able to bring the full potential of the manga . it was very fitting for the story and had a constant level throughout the whole series 
 
Sound: 9 
 
the sound track was amazing . it makes you really get in the mood and feel the excitment of the matches . the voice actors did great job  
 
Character: 8 
 
i fell in love with kuroko's character he was one of my favourite protagonists . every character has its unique way . i think  if there were any flaws it will be the sometimes unexplained strange bahaviour of some characters like akashi.

this is one of the best sports anime ever

    K, by Studio GoHands, is a beautiful anime.  
 
Whether you are new to anime, or have watched hundreds, it is immediately apparent that the art here is top notch, which is always a big plus in this media.  
 
The sound too, is top notch. Everything from the opening song ""KINGS"" by Angela, to  the ending song, ""Tsumetai Heya, Hitori""  by Mikako Komatsu, and everything in between is great. The background music throughout the show fits perfectly, and is a good choice thematically for the art style. (GoHands also uses Angela for their 2013 anime Coppelion, and her voice is superb as always).  
 
The story has often been criticized for being non-existent or incoherent, and I have to wonder if the people saying these things are just new to anime or not paying attention in general. In short, the series follows Yashiro Isana, a high school student, who is being accused of the murder of Tatara Totsuka, a member of HOMRA (HOMRA is one of the groups pursuing him). Throughout the show, it is up to Isana to prove his innocence to the crime, or be killed by one of his many pursuers.  
 
In general, the plot is easy to follow, and it has enough curves to keep you guessing until near the end. While there are still holes (which will hopefully be filled with the various manga series and the movie that is due for release), the story is still good, just not the best you've ever seen.  
 
The characters in this show work with the limited time we have with them. We are introduced to many, and while some are not all too important, for the most part, they don't fall into the ubiquitous cliche characters that we are seeing so often in anime these days. Given the number of characters in this 13 episode series, and the various factions they represent, we are not given as much character development as I would like to see. 
 
 Characters like Reisi and Mikoto obviously have so much going on that we never really get to see, so the viewer ends up feeling a bit left out and things that could have had much more impact fall a little short.  
 
In general though, most of the characters are likable or fill their roles nicely. 
 
Overall, this anime has a lot going for it, but falls short on some aspects. I feel that with more episodes, these flaws would not be so prominent, but that is up in the air. The show is definitely worth the watch, just for the art and soundtrack alone, as they are stylistically some of the best in anime. Everything else is enjoyable, and doesn't fit into the cookie cutters that so many people are used to, and for that, I commend it.  
 
8/10

    If you want to lose faith in humanity or enjoy a show with heavy gore without a real plot, this is the show for you. 
 
I thought I could handle gore since I'd done so with SNK. I also read all the glowing reviews about this show, so I gave it a go.  
 
Art- 3/10 Poor- The art style and character designs for several characters were so beautifully dramatic. They were probably the best things in this anime. If there there wasn't several characters that were freakishly deformed monstrosities and there wasn't so many close up shots of the nude curvy women (since the guys we see nude are only the freakish characters), I would have given the art style a 8/10.   
 
Characters- 1/10 Pathetic - You don't get to learn much about the characters because there is so much death. Regardless, I didn't want to know about most of them considering how they were almost all ruthless killers.The bonds within each clan is hardly expressed and it seems fake when it is.  
 
Plot- 1/10 Pathetic -This show is much more violent than SNK. Not to mention there's very little lingering/remorse after a character dies. About 90% of it is violent, grotesque, and nightmarish killing/plotting and remaining 10%is about the star-crossed lovers who give the impression that they're actually bad actors pretending to be in love. I watched to the end because I thought there would be a bright ending for this show's Romeo and Juliet... *spoiler alert star* sadly they were just as dumb as Romeo and Juliet *spoiler alert end*. Some characters purposefully get into fights they're obviously not going to win by any means, which is frustrating. There was a ""purpose"" to the all the murders, but it seemed like blood shed for absolutely no reason other than blood lust. Also, I'm not a fan of rape and attempted rape in shows.  
 
Music & Voice Acting- 4/10 Decent- Nothing really stood out to me, other than the fact that the voice actors and characters matched pretty well. The background music was okay. 
 
Overall enjoyment- 1/10 Pathetic- I didn't enjoy it at all. If someone wanted to torture me with a show, this is is the show they would use. I loathe for myself for ever watching this gruesome and pointless show. I'm probably scarred for life.

    Meh, I read the manga for only a bit (actually, when I stopped reading the manga, it was also the point where the anime stopped). 
 
Art: I must say I was very disappointed. Repeated action scenes, mediocre gun fights, time delay on gun shots, but the character illustrations are ok, the background scenes were only very mediocre. All in all, for an ""action"" and supposedly ""dark"" anime, it just doesn't give that feeling. It gives it a normal setting, nothing interesting. There were also very corny action scenes. If your a pro hitman or killer, how do you miss 15 shots when the target is standing still. Also when it shows Heine ""jumping around"", I laughed at the slow movement. I can't say much more about the art, but in short, I was disappointed. 
 
Sound: This was also a point where I didn't like it at all. You know how sometimes you read the manga, and you imagine a voice for the characters? I do that a lot ,and I must say a lot of the characters didn't fit my prediction of voicing. It might be selfish or just my opinion, but I believe that Naoto, Badou could have had better voice actors. Heine was average, I guess it suits him, although they need that evil sound. Naoto sounds too soft, and doesn't sound like a character seeking revenge or living a life of revenge. Badou just sounds too foolish and when he starts going on a rampage, his voice just doesn't click. There was no opening and ending (expected) and no background music. Time delay on bullet shots. Like after a bullet is shot, it takes 2-3 seconds to make contact with something. This was a bad part in the anime. 
 
Characters: I actually enjoyed each of their character traits. A chain smoker machine gunner, an experimental human that is cool and and emits a bad side, a girl training with the person she wants to kill (although this type of character has become more common now), and a old pro hitman that emits humor and seriousness. The drawings also suit them. Nothing more to say about the characters except that I liked it a lot because it is unique, fresh, and memorable. 
 
Story: I must say, they packed in a lot in 4 episodes. Two episodes contain a character background story, and the other two are character type stories (but you kind of get a little bit of Heine's background story). What I liked is how they connected the characters together. Nao as a paper delivery girl, Badou on the bus and meeting with Mihai, Heine partnered up with Badou, the list goes on. They connect it well for a character part OVA. Only thing I didn't like was that it was really predictable. Every action and movement, I can guess what's gonna happen next. Maybe because the art is slow?  
 
Enjoyment: I enjoyed it actually, seeing the characters and the ending of the OVA. It really captivates the audience (me anyways). The Naoto and Heine episodes really contain a moment on finding who the characters in the ending were. I enjoyed it while it lasted I guess. However, too many factors bring this down: cliche moments, predictability, bad action scenes, lacking sound, delay in sound, the list goes on for a bit. Although in my point of view, this OVA deserves a 3, just keeping with the manga, the great characters and some of the things they did with the story, made me give it a final score of 4. 
 
TL;DR It gets a 4, I enjoyed watching it, but it could of been a darker anime, better action packed, less corny scenes, and maybe make it a little faster pace?

    You know, there's always this one anime that just makes your mind blow. You have a lot of things to say about it, either in a good or a bad way, that you can't say anything. Well, Aoi Bungaku Series is one of those animes. And you either like it or hate it, there's no in between. In my case, I pretty much liked it. 
 
The whole concept of an anime that adapts six modern classics of Japanese literature is already original; I don't think I've ever seen something like that before.  
 
Since the anime is divided into 6 arcs that are totally unrelated, I'll be reviewing every arc's story individually. 
 
STORY: 
 
- No Longer Human (episode 1-4)  : The fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas; an artist who lost hope in humanity and himself, trying to find a purpose of his life.  
 
The story is outstanding. You can feel more emotions during four episodes than you do in an anime of 12-24 episodes. The whole psychology contest in ""No Longer Human"" causes you to focus and connect to Oba (the protagonist) rather than the environment or even the whole purpose of the author by writing that novel that got turned into an anime. 
 
 
- Under the Full Bloom of Cherry Blossom Forest (episode 5-6) : A bandit finds a beautiful maiden in the forest and how he does anything for her and takes her to be his wife, while he already got other wives, but this woman isn't an ordinary woman. 
 
That was probably the longest two episodes of the series. They were so weird. Although I knew there was supposed to be some kind of message behind it, the story plot made it hard to understand and I think it was the only story I disliked in Aoi Bungaku. It felt like it was all about how easily the human being can be blinded by love and be manipulated. 
 
- Kokoro (episode 7-8) : The story of young man who lives with a widow and her daughter, invites his childhood friend known as ""K"" (I guess) to live with him. This last falls in love with the widow's daughter and the young man gets jealous of ""K"". 
 
The best part of this story is its message. The story is in two different points of view, and we can understand that it is important to know every part of whatever story we hear about before we judge it whatsoever. Also, jealousy is the main purpose of Kokoro. 
 
- Run, Melos! (episode 9-10) : This story deals with friendship, love, insecurities, betrayal and trust. It's about a playwright who is asked to write the scenario of a theater play based on ""Run, Melos!"". The play is related to the playwright's life and feelings in some way. 
 
It is written by Dazai Osamu, the same man that wrote No Longer Human. I think this is my favorite story in Aoi Bungaku. It is unique, kinda predictable but I enjoyed it anyways. The ending was more or less satisfying; I personally was in tears at the end of the 10th episode. Friendship can be beautiful and it's never too late to do anything. It may sound cliché but I don't think it really is. 
 
- The Spider's Thread (episode 10) : An evil person meets death and lands in hell. The one good thing he had done in his whole life was to not kill a spider he met in the city. He just didn't kill her although he killed whoever was in his way numbly. 
 
This story made me uncomfortable but no matter how you look at it, whether you believe that Kandata deserved to rot in Hell for all eternity or not, this is a story that is not easy to forget. A mind blowing story that leaves you with many, many unanswered questions about yourself, about life, hell and human stupidity. Unfortunately, it is too short to be considered a masterpiece 
 
- Hell Screen (episode 11): The story of A feudal lord who ordered an artist to make paintings that describe scenes of Buddhist hell. The painter couldn't, since he's never seen the hell of his eyes. But the Lord, unhappy, made him discover it. 
 
A simple story with a successful atmosphere. As brilliant as he was, the painter was also bizarre and inhumanly cold; nothing could stand between him and the perfection of his craft. What are we willing to sacrifice to complete our masterpieces? Everything. A story on how truth will conquer all, culminating in the fate of the Lord himself. 
 
ART:  
 
I don't think we can say anything about the art. It is well done. Neither the style nor the quality changed during the six arcs, which is awesome in my point of view. The shades of color differed from arc to arc which was enjoyable. 
 
SOUND: 
 
The special effects were S U G O I. Just amazing. Every episode starts with a narrator that talks about the classic novel is original, amusing and you start getting in the arc easily. The fact that there was no opening doesn't even need to be considered. The ending was really good and fitted all six stories.  
 
CHARACTERS: 
 
Every character was so different from another, yet some had a few similarities. And I think that Oba from No Longer Human was the best out of them, his improvements, his attitude... it has to leave a mark on you. I don't even know what to say more about it. Plus, most of the stories focus more on the themes and the messages. And since there is so many casts, I don't think it is necessary to talk about the supporting ones. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
As I said from the start, you'd either like it or hate it, there is no in between. It is a very, very remarkable work of art that I'm not ready to forget about it soon. I don't think I'll ever will. It even made me want to read the novels although I'm not really into classics. I'd definitely re-watch it someday. 
 
Overall rating : (8/10)

    Kill la Kill was the right hype train to hop on for fans looking for mindless fun and action. When you look at it from a critical point of view though, it's a slightly different story. 
 
STORY 
I actually loved the story of Kill la Kill because I felt it was the best part of its 'parody' plan. Kill la Kill is a parody of modern anime, with all of its fanservice, skill names being read out in a fight, numbered group of villains, school life, transformation sequences, a huge plot that often has the fate of the world depending on a group of teenagers... Kill la Kill's storyline is a great attempt to be the embodiment of all these elements and cliches, while being creative in its own way.  
 
Why do so many people say that Kill la Kill was overrated? Some of it has to do with how Kill la Kill failed to be a parody halfway and just became that very anime that it was trying to make jokes of. This doesn't stop the great storytelling accompanied with a great soundtrack from keeping you hooked to the show. Besides, while people often criticise the middle portion of the show for not being very valuable to the overall plot, the conclusion to the story is an epic one that you can look forward to. (And I still liked the middle portion, just because it was fun to watch.) 
 
ART 
Kill la Kill's art and animation can be described best as 'inconsistent'. Like any other show with a badly managed budget, the first few episodes of Kill la Kill contain some impressive animation, fight scenes, background art and character art, but as the show goes on, the episodes are increasingly littered with amateurish animation and other lazy stuff. Fortunately for Kill la Kill the occassional bad animation and fights that end straight up in a still frame still somewhat contribute to the overall goofy easygoing atmosphere of the show.  
 
SOUND 
The soundtrack is amazing. It also comes with the infamous ""Don't lose your way"" song and everyone's favourite ""Ping Pong Circulate"" track. It is seriously good, though. I struggle to come up with one bad thing to say about the soundtrack, the timings that they are played at during the events of the show, or anything. It accompanies the show's cast and events nearly perfectly. I personally found Satsuki's theme being overplayed just so slightly during the anime but that's alright because it's a fantastic track anyway. 
 
CHARACTER 
I think all the other reviews talk plenty about the lackluster explanation for Ryuuko's motivation to avenge his dad, or Ragyou's plan to [spoilers]. These are some noticeable gaps in character development. However each character in the show is undeniably unique and attractive. The Four Devas, Ryuuko and Senketsu, Nudist Beach, the Kiryuuin family, the Mankanshoku family, and the rest of the city and the academy are all each portrayed carefully well, throughout all the episodes consistently. Rather than having arcs of several episodes to develop each character, they are all developed continuously, in small episodes.  
 
One very important character in the show is Mako. She's not just there for the comedic value, but she really is one of the main characters who is weaved into the main plot and also acts as a deus ex machina who can interject in any situation, whether it be a serious neck-and-neck one or a goofy and funny one, and control the atmosphere of the whole scene. I found her character particularly interesting because of this, along with all her funny moments and the ship with Gamagoori. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
If you don't have fun while watching Kill la Kill, I would say you need to see a doctor. But that's just my personal opinion. My point is that Kill la Kill is an anime that is seriously trying so hard to be enjoyable it feels like being enjoyable is its only purpose. (And it succeeds!) You don't need to put much thought into it or understand everything. I recommend you don't overthink it while watching Kill la Kill because that removes some fun and instead reveals some critical mistakes in character development that you would rather not see. 
 
Its entertaining nature is the main reason why I cannot give Kill la Kill a lower score despite the mistakes it makes.

    I hear alot of people refer to this anime as ""Wasted Potential""........I say that's true in one sense, but I'm pretty sure people are getting the wrong idea by that. 
 
I don't remember exactly how I heard about this anime, but after I read the premise, I was thoroughly intrigued. The one main thing that kept me at bay for a while was the poor art and animation...and, not gonna lie, throughout the show, it doesn't get much better either. Infact, I'd say the art and animation downright sucked in this show. But the thing that makes this show amazing deals with everything else. 
 
One way I liked to refer to it as, is a JK Rowling level story, made with a Hentai's production value........I have no idea why THAT was the comparison that came to my mind at the time, but I decided to roll with it. 
 
In short, the story was one of the best aspects of this show. It takes a while to get going, but once it did, It sucked me in right away. I'm not gonna lie that the pacing could get a little wonky, and it felt super choppy at points, but all In all I'd say it held up nicely. The climax was well handled, and I actually didn't see it coming. The ending took a pretty intense turn and got...pretty difficult to follow along with, not gonna lie. However, that's not the shows fault, that's me being kinda dumb with all that technical stuff. I was able to understand the gist of it, and I honestly found it all fascinating. Everything came full circle, and I believed it. 
 
The next best aspect of the show is definitely the characters. All of them were really interesting, and I cared about them. Whenever the characters were going through something, I believed their struggle and I sympathised with them. When one of the characters would die, It actually made me legitimately upset. Like, I'm pretty sure I cried about 5 times during this show...not something that happens often. As well, alot of the characters were given really good development. While, there are some characters I would of liked to have been explored more, I was satisfied with what I got. I even empathized with the antagonist at the end. I was sure I'd royally despise him throughout the show, but I actually believed his struggle and felt sorry for him. 
 
One of my main issues with the show deal with what I said at the start. The art and animation...are not that good. I know it's an older anime, but I've seen better looking shows from the 90s. Which makes me upset that a story as good as this was given such poor animation. It deserved so much more than what it was given. I honestly hope they decide to remake this show someday, cause it definitely deserves it. 
 
The only other real issue I had with the show were some plot points seemed to be left out or overlooked. I can't really go into detail of what they are cause that'd be spoilers, but you'll know them when you see them.  
 
But now here's the one question I always want to know when watching an anime..........was the ending satisfying?..........and yes, I can happily say that the ending was indeed satisfying. It was bittersweet, and left me with a smile on my face.  
 
Overall, If I was to give this show a ranking for just enjoyment alone, I'd give it a 9/10. However, I realize the amount of issues it did have so I'm going to give it a final score of 8/10. This show is definitely a diamond in the rough, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

    This anime is, truly, a masterpiece in all ways. My favorite anime of all time. 
 
Here is why. 
 
First of all, character development. You can CLEARLY see ALL of the characters, including ALL of the side characters, develop. In the ending of this anime, the fates of almost ALL of the characters, even side characters, are told to you. The anime is complete, in every single way.  
 
Every character has a purpose. There is no dillydallying, no characters put in to just hand Ed and Al a piece of information and then disappear for the rest of the series, gone to who knows where. This happens in most animes, but not here. Every character, even the side characters, and EXTREMELY important. If not in the story, then they find some way to enter the hearts of us, whether through connections with other characters who care about them, or whatever else.  
 
There is a perfect balance of comedy and seriousness, sadness and joy, and all other opposites. Character's background stories are executed perfectly, in the right times in the right moments in the right ways. 
 
In the first, let's say... 10 episodes of the anime, (especially first episode), you may find yourself being a LITTLE bit bored, and like ""ughh this is like any other anime"" but TRUST ME, right after 10-15 episodes it gets to an awesome thing 
bye

    Mod Edit: Review contains spoilers 
 
It all starts with a meteor which gives special powers to childs till their teen years strike, which then they forget about their powers and completely lose them.And ofcourse Jun Maeda( famous for making clannad and angel beats ) writes this anime and forcing some melodrama in the middle of the anime. 
While a mere teen ""Otosaka Yuu"" has to cure them all from their "" disease"" so that they won't be experimentated by the government. 
 
At the start of the anime Yuu has the power to plunder other abilities but he doesnt know that, and he has the power to control someone for a certain amount of time. And he gets busted, but not by the government but by some students who force him not to abuse his power and enroll their school where people with supernatural abilities like them are. And they need to enroll more students. 
Yuu needs to remove every ability from all ability users and to do that he must overcome alot of obstacles 
The ending was a little rushed though ;/ 
 
Story 7/10 
 
Just explained it above here. Nothing too special neither too mediocre 
 
Art 10/10 
 
Sick art by P.A Works. Nothing to complain about 
 
Sound 9/10 
 
Both liked the opening and ending of the anime.

Character 7/10 
 
Somewhat decent i guess but some characters dont get enough screen time and you'll notice when you watch it 
 
Enjoyment 9/10 
 
Liked the anime in general but story could've been better and the character development as stated above 
 
Overall 8/10  
 
Story good/Decent, Art Outstanding, Sound Great, Character Good/satisfied, Enjoyment Great, Overall Very good

    Nisemonogatari was an interesting follow-up to the cult classic Bakemonogatari, a dialogue-heavy show full of character interactions and a visual presentation unlike any other. For me, the only issue keeping me from viewing the series as a modern masterpiece were some pacing issues, and unfortunately Nise continues the trend of an awkwardly flowing story that never seems to get on the right foot.   
 
The eleven episode series is comprised of two arcs, Karen Bee and Tsukihi Phoenix. What stands out is that the Karen Bee arc is seven episodes long, coming in as a very long arc for the Monogatari series, even though the amount of information in the Tsukihi Phoenix arc is far greater than what was conveyed in the Karen Bee arc. While watching the first arc, the pacing is slowed to a crawl, with whole episodes being devoted to mundane, everyday conversations not needed to progress the mission of justice. 
 
Even if these conversations don’t expound the plot, it still is nice to listen to these very fleshed out characters interact with each other and be put into entertaining situations. The real question is if these things can be justified if they are over fifteen minutes long. I can’t really shake the sense of deja vu when I watch these scenes; they seem very similar to situations from Bakemonogatari. Senjougahara verbally abuses Araragi some more, Nadeko flirts some more and Hachikuji makes paedophile jokes.  
 
As much as these first few episodes feel recycled, the addition of Shinobu actually talking and the Fire Sisters keeps them from feeling like a waste of time, they come off as a poorly executed introduction back to the world instead. Speaking of Shinobu, her voice actor performs excellently and breathes life into every scene that she is in. I also think that the comedic chemistry of the Fire Sisters, specifically Karen, and Araragi is solid, both characters alternating between the straight man and comic role, then moving to serious discussion later in the conversation seamlessly.   
 
Of course, I can’t review this installment without talking about the fanservice. This is the most sexually charged Monogatari series of the bunch, told through the perspective of an already horny Araragi feeling even hornier. A certain bathtub scene comes to mind as the center of libido that this show carries with it, and it quite large amount of libido, mind you. 
 
 But the thing that I find the most fascinating is the way that Nise handles treating its’ female characters in terms of presentation of fanservice. A normal, flavor of the week harem that nobody remembers after its airing would use the camera in order to provide panty shots and the like. This method comes off to me as lazy and tired. What Nise chooses to do instead I feel saves it from becoming the weakest in the series. Of course fanservice is often sexist in nature and puts characters in a sexual light that objectifies them. However, this series chooses to stop relying on the camera to peek up girl’s skirts in order to sexualize characters, and decided to instead portray the female characters as they want to be. 
 
When Nadeko invites Araragi to her house in order to seduce and flirt with him, she is seen in a sexual light because she wants to be seen that way. When Araragi is in the bathtub with Shinobu provocative camera angles are used because Shinobu is flaunting her sexuality in order to mess with Araragi. The toothbrushing scene is shot in the way that it is because both Araragi and Karen are feeling the sexual tension in the scene and between them, using the Incest trope in a new and refreshing way. 
 
To wrap this up, this new way of presenting sexuality is fantastic and makes the viewer look at a fanservice, a boring and almost necessary trope, in a new way. The way it presents these things provides gratification without insulting the watcher’s intelligence. Double out.

Second Note: My score is for the entire series not just season 2 or 1. 
 
The fate franchise is a vast amount of information expanding multiple shows, movies, books, manga, and short stories. There is definitely a lot to take in for a new comer to the franchise. So first I would like to say that if you are going to start anywhere you should read the visual novel of fate/stay night first. Granted if you don’t want to do that then this anime is your next best thing. After finishing Fate Stay Night UBW it would be a good idea to watch Fate/Zero. I wouldn’t recommend watching Fate/Zero first because it does spoil some things for this anime and the upcoming Heaven’s Feel movie.  So here is an order for you Visual Novel or UBW -> Heaven’s Feel Movie -> Fate Zero and if you want to be completions then you can watch Deens adaption of the Fate/Stay Night anywhere in the above order.  Now here is the review. 
 
Story: Fate/Stay Night’s story follows the life of an amateur magus and our protagonist Shirou Emiya.  His participation in the Holy Grail War is the main focus for our story. The Holy Grail War is currently taking place in Shirou’s home town Fuyuki City. During the Holy Grail War seven magus known as masters are aided by seven beings known as servants which are the reincarnation of legendary heroes from the past, present and future. During the war it is the goal of each Master Servant pair to kill the other Masters and take possession of the Holy Grail and have their wish granted.  During the Fifth Holy Grail war our protagonist is the master of the servant named Saber. One of the main themes of the story is Shirou’s wish to save everyone and become known as a hero of justice. Throughout the story Shirou’s ideals are tested and brought to question. So I don’t spoil anything I will stop here with the synopsis of the story. Now the first two episodes (0 and 1) are mostly info dumps on who is participating in the War and what the rules of the war are. Both episodes may seem to drag on for new comers and overall it might have been a better idea for them to spread out the information instead of just shoving it all into a few episodes.  
 
In the first half of the show  the story is paced rather well and I don’t have very many complaints with how it was written.  I do feel some characters that have larger roles in the second half should have been given more screen time and more development. One such character is Rin the primary love interest of Shriou in this anime. For a primary love interest I feel she plays a rather small role in the first half and isn’t fully given enough time to develop. Her Tsundere personality is fine in the first half but as the relationship grows the personality is never really turned down and this makes the relationship feel a bit awkward overall. The relationship at one point will be very romantic and then at the next point Rin will be hitting Shirou over the head with a pillow.  
 
There are also a few servants that could have been given some more development as well along with our main antagonist who up until the second half really isn’t given much screen time at all. I would go into more details but I feel I will be spoiling some things.  Now, if you are wondering if it’s a good adaption of the visual novel I would have to say its ok. There are quite a few things that get cut out but overall it is better than any other adaption out there at this time. Ufotable also throws in some extra stuff that really isn’t needed in place of cannon material. One character in particular has her entire backstory replaced. I think the new backstory is ok and gives the audience a gist of what kind of character she is but in my opinion it isn’t as good as the original backstory.  During the second 
half I fell the pace picks up a bit too quickly. Things that should have taken a few episodes to develop are instead crammed into only one episode. Personally I feel this makes it a bit jarring overall. The pacing of the second half starts off fast but it does even out at times as well. This does make it feel like some content is sacrificed as well. It is also one of the main reasons the romantic relationship feels awkward at times and why some characters are given very little time to develop.  
 
The final issue I have with the story occurs in season 2. There is a scene that occurs later in this season that completely breaks cannon and overall doesn’t make a lot of sense. Basically, the whole idea of how magic is inherited from person to person is disregarded during this scene.  Really it was one of few problems I had with how Ufotable adapted the story of UBW. 
 
 
Animation: There are only a few series that are animated as well or better then Fate/Stay Night UBW. There really isn’t much else to say other than. There are a few animated faces that do look a bit weird at times but overall the animation is rather fluid especially during the battle scenes. Really if you decided not to watch this show for the story watching it for the animation and sound is probably enough to entertain most viewers. There are some CG scenes which I feel are rather well done but some people may feel they detract from the story. I personally think the CG makes the scenes in question feel more surreal.   
 
Sound: The sound is also great. I feel every track works well with both the show and even as standalone pieces. During the battle scenes the sound really helps bring out the intensity of the fighting. During the emotional scenes it sets the mood perfectly. There is one exception. During episode 13 there is a rather emotional scene that wasn’t given any sound at all during the broadcast (this may be fixed on the BD release) It really makes the scene seem less impactful the what it really is. Outside of the OST the voice acting is also superb. Every character’s voice fits their personality to a T.   
 
Characters: As mentioned above some characters really aren’t given as much screen time as they needed or deserve. I have already talked about our main heroine RIn above but now I will discuss some of the other characters.  
 
Shirou: I feel it’s hard to talk about him without mentioning the fact that in the VN most of his dialogue is internal monologues. This I do feel detracts from his character and makes him seem less interesting and some may not feel emotionally invested in his character. But, if Ufotable had gave him more inner monologues the show would have been much longer. Shirou for the most part is displayed as a man who wants to save everyone no matter the cost even if it’s his own life. He will go out of his way to save his friends and thinks about other before himself. To some this seems childish. This anime is mainly about Shriou facing his ideals and developing them over the course of the anime.  
 
Saber: Saber is a fan favorite and a flagship character for the Type Moon franchise. Granted in this route she takes a back seat at times for other characters. I think her character does suffer a bit because of this. She is a strong willed individual and I don’t feel that is displayed as good as it could have been. In fact compared to the Saber in Fate/Zero this one seems a bit more on the cute side and her personality takes a similar turn. Ufotable took the strong willed Saber that many fans of Fate/Zero and the Fate VN and made her into a passive observer in some cases. I do think at times this can be overlooked because UBW is Shirou’s story and not Sabers. Saber still does play a part though as parts of some episodes do focus on her past and her wish as well. Saber unlike Shirou regrets her past and wants to change it and by the end of UBW this plot thread is given a satisfying conclusion. 
 
Archer: Archer’s personality is the polar opposite of Shirou. He’s cynical and believes that everything Shirou think is wrong and childish. Archer does get a good amount of development and backstory. Throughout the series Archer is usually the person who Shirou is combating his ideals with.  I think Archer is a very well written character and does a good job at playing the opposite side to Shirou’s ideals of saving everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: Even though I have played the Vn for all of its faults I still think Fate/Stay Night UBW is one of the best anime to come out this year. Its story is engaging and its animation and music is breathtaking as well. While is characters do suffer from a lack of characterization at times I feel it is a very good adaption to an excellent visual novel and would recommend it to any fan of the medium.  
 
 
Score (calculated based on Story, Animation, Sound, and Characters) 8.25/10

    This is my first review, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. 
 
There is no doubt in my mind that Shelter has appeal. The visuals are high in quality, the main girl, Rin, is cute and I could stare at her all day, the colours are, for the most part, appealing, and the music is beautiful (this is very much dependent on how much appreciation you can have for the genre, and if electronic music isn't your thing, this music video will be very off-putting) 
 
But that is where my compliments for this music video come to an end. 
 
The most obvious problem is the story and characters. The only two characters are Rin and what I assume to be her father, and I challenge you to tell me anything about them from the music video. What is Rin like? I have watched this music video several times and I still have no idea. I have no reason to care about her besides the fact that she is a cute anime girl. 
 
**SPOILER WARNING!!** 
The story starts off fine, a girl stuck in space, creating a world for herself. Sounds cool, I was wondering where they would go with it... 
 
Not very far. 
 
The story seems to follow a dystopia in which humanity is on the way out, and a concerned father builds a spaceship to protect his daughter from harm, and is about her loneliness as she relives her memories. 
 
I have so many unanswered questions. How is she staying alive in space? How is sending your daughter into space a better idea than living out your lives together for as long as possible? She treats her memories as if they are bad or traumatic, which makes no sense. Why would she see those memories as a bad thing? 
 
**END OF SPOILER WARNING!!** 
 
I just didn't have enough time to care about the characters. Rin had no personality or depth and I just could not bother to trouble myself with her. The only reason you have to be concerned about her is that she is a cute girl. If she wasn't a cute girl, would anyone care? I doubt it. And cute girls just aren't enough to make me care. 
 
Another thing I want to point out is the song lyrics. They show themes of creating protection for a loved one, as well as loneliness and solitude. There are so many better ways to do this that wouldn't feel so fake and lifeless. The lyrics combined with the music video just don't work together. Only the base ideas got across and thus the music video and song are barely connected. 
 
5/10. The  song is beautiful, and if you love electronic music, the song alone is worth a listen. The visuals are pretty, for the most part, however they are very boring and the CG isn't nice on the eyes, so I'm not even sure I can recommend it for the visuals. It's just a bunch of stimuli on the screen that so many people seem to be falling for.

    How does one describe ordinary. Any dictionary will probably describe ordinary as ""Something that is commonly encountered, usual"" or something to that effect. So how does a show like Nichijou (which roughly translates to Regular Life) get a title like... well Nichijou. A show with robots, wigs, deer, and all manner of unusal things is anything but... ordinary right? Perhaps they titled it like this as a bit of a joke, to bounce off all the crazy stuff that is to come. But I think there is a little bit more behind the title than first meets the eye. Lets find out shall we? 
 
Ok, lets start from the beginning. Waaaaaaaayyyyyy back in 2011, Nichijou first aired. I was in the motion of looking for something new to watch so I was keeping an eye on the new releases. When I glanced over Nichijou, my initial reaction was ""hmmm high school slice o'life comedy... heh"". Nothing immediatly jumped to my attention as a ""must watch anime"". Slice of life has always been very hit and miss with me... so I decided it probably wasn't worth my time and moved on to watch other things.  
 
But... and I'm not entirely sure why... something stuck with me. When I first saw the ad for Nichijou, there was a picture of a girl, standing somewhat alone on top of a trash pile (with a few characters in the background), holding a flower pot. The most notable thing about the character was a giant wind up toy screw sticking out of her back. At the time I dismissed it but the image somehow stayed floating around somewhere in my subconscious. The art style just appealed to me, it was so simple and yet somehow a little bit elegant. And so, a couple of months after it finished airing, I decided to watch the series. I loved it. 
 
Nichijou is a very odd series to review. Like most slice of lifes (slice of lives?), there isn't really a plot. Its just that... a slice of life, a little piece of a characters life. Or in Nichijou's case, many characters lives.  Its a formula that is almost entirely dependant on how well the audience can relate to the character in question. There are other factors too of course, being a comedy, the humor itself is obviously important, and things like art and sound add bits here and there, but above all else, characterization is the key to its success. And well, in that regard I think Nichijou succeeded far beyond my expectations.  
 
Lets start with the main characters. We basically have 2 groups, one being a young High school girl named Yuuko, with her 2 friends Mai and Mio, the other being a Robot named Nano, who lives with a child professor and a talking cat named Sakamoto. Wait what, talking cats, child professors, ROBOTS... do go on. Yes Nichijou certainly has its fill of odd and wacky characters, but to be honest, they are all very relatable and loveable characters. Each of them are funny in their own way, but they also have some very down to earth, even touching moments.  
 
But, to be honest, the side characters are also pretty hilarious. Its funny, the series kind of jumps from story to story, sometimes lingering on one for less than 10 seconds, sometimes lasting for over 5 minutes. And yet it never feels confusing or cluttered. I don't think there was a single character I didn't at least somewhat enjoy watching, and it became very enjoyable to wonder in the little 5 second breaks between each short segment, as to who we are going to meet next.  
 
Ok, so the characters are all well and good, but that can't be it can it? Well no, theres obviously more to it than that. Lets start with the comedy. To be honest... this is the part that tears me apart a little (just a little mind you). There are some freaking hilarious scenes in this show, but there are also some jokes that fall kind of flat. A lot of the jokes in this series (especially the ones between Mai and Yuuko) are more... ""weird"" than funny. I feel like there are a lot of puns in this series too, which isn't a bad thing, but seeing as I can't speak a lick of Japanese they usually won't mean anything to the average english speaking viewer.  But I don't think the bad or the weird jokes are enough to do the series any harm. For each joke that falls flat, there are 2 or 3 more that will have you grinning from ear to ear. So I think the comedy holds up very well as well. As a final little touch, I think the art and music are both very well done. The art is so simple, but it just works so well. It captures the mood of the series perfectly I think. The sound too I think is amazing. There is a little bit about half way into the series that has no dialouge, about the girls building a tower of cards. I won't give away what happens, but the orchestra accompaniment makes it feel like its straight out of Fantasia. Overall very well done. 
 
Looking back over this little piece on Nichijou... I still think something is missing. My head tells me that it isn't exactly that amazing of a series. While quite strong.. the characters are good and the comedy is good... its not anything special right? It doesn't step over any boundries, its not the funniest thing I've ver seen... so why do I love it so much? I think the reason is, above all else, this series has a wonderful beautiful atmosphere to it. While there are some very wacky moments, the series will always take time to slow things down and create a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere as well. Everytime I watch an episode, a feeling comes over me. I feel safe, I feel at home. I'm in a world that I'm used to, that I've come to love. Its not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but here it is cheerful... peaceful... ordinary.  
 
If theres one thing this series has to teach... its that ordinary is in the eye of the beholder. What might seem ordinary to you, might be completely alien to another. But its that regular stuff you take for granted... Your Ordinary Life... that makes you who you are. Enjoy it to the best of your abilities.

    Hentai Elite here, this time talking about whatever this was. 
 
I'm a man who can appreciate a variety of fetishes, therefore I don't frown too hard at a little NTR. 
If it's done well. 
 
This falls to do so and is rather lackluster as a whole. There's not a lot to work with here and I'm not just talking about the story. The sex scenes themselves are overall an utter disappointment. The amount of content in them is unacceptable. 
 
The StOrY, if you even care enough is basically; Man has to work away, distanced from his girlfriend and comes home on weekends. The girlfriend hangs out with her friends and meets senpai. She get drunk and kisses him or something leading him to go to her house and rape her, but she's into it so meh. The boyfriend was home at the time too, but nothing interesting happens. The thing that annoyed me the most was that this had potential to have some interesting things happen, like at the amusement park the dude look like he was gonna have a threesome with the girlfriends friends while riding the ferris wheel. But all we got was a LAME oral sex scene between the girlfriend and senpai.  
  
This is just boring honestly, how am I suppose to have a premium nut when with this hollow excuse of a hentai. 
 
This got 1 nut.

    Ok, let me get this straight I LOVE IT. 
I absolutely adore every character in this anime. The story: wowza. Animation: I love it so much it's my jam. For me it's perfect anime, its has everything you need: main character who is a cute cinnamon bun with a meme face, nerdy girl who loves books and a lot of fan boys, the emo girl who loves mushrooms, the bad rich girl who bullies main character who is also secretly gay for her and a mysterious figure who is good btw, what else do you need? Anime about a dream and the main character Akko does everything to achieve it. She faces a lot of difficulties, because of the plot twist. Absolutely love this anime. 
Rating it 10 witch hats/10

    This is my first ever review so please go easy on me haha!  
******** IM NOT GOING TO SPOIL ANYTHING UNTIL I TALK ABOUT THE ENJOYMENT SECTION ******** 
 
Okay, so to start off let me just say that this was an emotional rollercoaster. Nuff said. 
 
Story: If you've watched Kill La Kill then you may understand me when I say that this anime has the ""bigger picture"" plot. A smaller story begins to develop into something more extravagant and in this case, more threatening. Now I am a huge fan of these plot lines but I find them misleading much like Family Guy. In order to not spoil anything, all I can really say is this, ""The story had me believing that at episode 12, things were going to end quickly. But it just kept going and going; I wanted more and more. But I did feel as though there were some flaws regarding the speed of the story."" I did read the manga and I have to say that the anime trailed away, causing it to end earlier. It felt rushed. 
 
Art: Honestly, it's nothing too special. However, there are some points where I simply loved the artistic style. For Example, during basic moments with dialogue and simple banter between characters, it's style is what you'd expect anime to be. But during intense scenes, it's bright and colorful, mixed with beautifully fluid animation. Again, without spoiling anything, here's an example: During a fight scene, you can see all of the action. There are no stray aways. The blood isn't bland, it's vibrant and has the look of actual blood. It isn't watery, but has actual depth to it which says that the artists paid proper attention to detail. This leads to the gore, it's brutal and detailed. Now this doesn't mean it's guts and brains but.... damn. Don't eat food.  
 
Sound: Imagine Fairy Tail but more dark and somber. Akame Ga Kill takes place in the time of Knights.. so medieval-ish. The music was orchestrated properly, but what really stood out the most were the sounds during battle and the simple cartoonish sounds. But I'll get to the section after Characters. 
 
Characters: I find this very difficult to do without spoiling anything so I'll just say this, ""The characters aren't all stereotypical. And that's what i loved so much."" I am only going to do the main characters that you get to know and love. 
 
Tatsumi ""Main Character""i: Starting off we have the first character. A boy who wants to save his family from poverty. He's headstrong and will do anything to save his village. He believes in justice but damn, he's naive. Though despite this, he's very bold and level-headed AT TIMES. There's a reason why I put the Main Character in quotations. But watch the show and you'll know why. 
 
Leone: From the name you can probably guess she's a cat girl > (Leone ~ Lion) But she has big boobs and she's blonde. However, she's also headstrong and very intelligent. She has a cocky attitude and a fiery temper. She shows no mercy to those who don't deserve it.  
 
Sheele: Long purple hair, glasses, reads books. Scratch that, reads A book along the lines of helping air headed people. She's dumb. She is quiet and loves to smile. But like that particular character, she has a dark past. With this dark past, she developed a knack for killing.  
 
Akame: She's also quiet and with a dark past. But you could call her the ""robotic"" character. This is because of her poker face that she holds. So when shit gets real, you'll know because she shows expressions. But Akame also has Moe Moe moments. Poker Faced Moe characters are the best. 
 
Bulat ""Handsome"" or ""Bro"" : He's muscular, got sweet hair, wields a staff, and is a true leader/inspiration to Tatsumi. Oh and he's also gay.. unlike the next character. 
 
Lubbock: Wields strings as a weapon. He's truly an ass kicker. Too bad he can't get ass. Basically, on a team made up of most girls, he's the pervert. But like Tatsumi, he's passionate about fighting and protecting his family.  
 
Boss (Her real name slips me but they call her Boss) : She's the boss of the group. Level-headed, calm, firm, but also friendly. Boss has all of the qualities of a leader. You don't really get to see much of her because she's usually commanding the others.  
 
Finally...  
 
Mine: I saved her for last because, though there isn't A LOT to mention about her, I can say that she is a Tsundere. She's petite and dresses like a lolita. Mine wields a long rifle that literally powers up based on her emotions. So you can imagine, being a tsundere, how much firepower she's packing. She's emotional, loves her dearest friend Sheele, and is the typical girly girl.  
 
********SPOILERS BELOW********** SKIP TO "">>>>>>>>>>>>"" to avoid spoilers. 
 
 
 
Enjoyment: Out of all of these numbers, I gave this a 7. Why? Look.. fine. I'll spoil it. So here we go.  
 
The anime to me, is known as, Game of Thrones Anime. Characters die. And Tatsumi isn't the main character. The show is called Akame Ga Kill. Guys. Please. If you cried from Angel Beats, you'll break down watching this. I love this show but I don't want to watch it again because the characters I love die. There was a character I loved, and she had her head sliced off and mounted on a spear. In the very end, Leone dies because of wounds, Sheele dies in the 4th episode I think.. I'm not too sure, but she gets eaten. I don't even want to talk about the others.

    The story progress goes as follows (Spoiler alert but do you even care?): 
 
---- 
 
*Hearthbeats and closeup shot of earth for 1 minute* 
 
The reporter dude babbles about an unknown object for half a minute in an excited voice. 
 
It seems most of the people in the city must have been bored by the reporter dude and immediately took a vacation on Madagascar island or something, since streets are pretty empty. This might give you the impression that the reporter dude is the main villain who bores citizens to death and causes total evacuations on major places; but don't be fooled by it, there is an amazing plot twist! 
 
Probably one of the most annoying anime OP and song you will eve- HEYEYEYEAAAAA TAI AI A 
 
©2004 IDEA FACTORY /  DESIGN FACTORY 
©2004 IDEA FACTORY 
 
The reporter dude gives us even more detailed and useful information about the unknown object. (Ooooo it moves!) And repeats the very same sentence in case you missed it out of boredom.  
 
A single CGI fighter jet enjoys the sunshine while it flies above the empty city. 
 
The booby woman says to the white dressed dude she will inform others about it. (No army networking or telecommunication seems to exist and the reporter dude must be really boring after all..) 
 
We learn on the HQ the big squid monster is big and his energy is increasing. It will probably do some stuff i guess. 
 
We watch the other mecha users taking their sweet time while they chill out and do some archery, fool around with mechas on mudfight and taking shower. And we even see the squid monster fly above them while he was on the city few seconds ago.. Doing pretty much nothing, just showing itself off. 
 
The blonde tits lady asks brown oppai lady to quit daydreaming. She says it has been 5 years. So she get backs on the business to find others while they-... 
... 
Orgazming on a weird machine..? 
 
Oh.. Nevermind, they already got assembled! 
 
They learn from the big military guy that their mission is to destroy the target even it causes some civil lifes. But thankfully our ""reporter dude"" already fled everyone in the city so that probably won't be an issue. So he was planning that all ahead! Thank you based reporter dude! 
 
The big military dude says the target is the enemy(ooooohh i see..). 
 
They cleverly waste infantry/manpower as meatshields to drain the monsters energy or something. 
 
The bazooka lady wonders if that is their enemy.(Who knows??) 
 
The big military dude says he will not accept failures. 
 
The white dude explains the well constructed plan to the girls. They will find a weak spot and shot a bomb from a bazooka then booom boom pew pew tatatata pachow pachow bwwwwwooooooshh. The brown bosoms will be the first. 
 
Suddenly the squid mosnter thingy sweeps away some of the pesky military thingies. 
 
Oh btw the yellow boby gril wants 2 b first. Cus she didn't like the orders. Then they argue or something. 
 
They take off with their mechas.. The blonde grill goes first even the order wasn't.. Whatevs.. She shoots ""a bomb with bazooka"". Then the alien thing hits her. Then it hits another booby lady. Our brown lady screams with grief (and earrape). 
 
O cool they located the core with the bazooka plan. Before they launch their second attack, the alien thing throws the white uniform guy with his plane. The brown hair colored lady grabs the plane but gets attacked by alien and screams with agony (and earrape). After that we watch some terrible flashbacks and jumpcuts of her origin ""story"". She is apperently a robot or clone or some shit.. Anyways thats enough lore 4 u! Back to the fight. 
 
Then they.. uuuh.. so apperently they need to find the weak spot? But i thought you guys already found it ?...??? Then the big military dude calls the white military dude crazy, because... What are they even on about? Dude this shit is soo deep for me. 
 
Another flashback of pictures where they use that lewd machines, doing some balloon inflation contest and shit... The white military dude attacks but hoooooooo she loves him but anyway girl attacks the alien thing. Then she defeats the core with love i gue-- Ye they beat it horray... 
 
Then the big military dude deletes the white uniform dude from his phone call list.... ????????????????????????????????????????????  
 
1 year later... 
 
Hello again reporter dude... This time he says there are ""couple of unknown objects"". And it ends with a """"""cliffhanger"""""" i assume. 
 
.... 
 
... 
 
.. 
 
---- 
 
Yeah this is just terrible.. It might be fun to get couple of drinks and watch with your friends tho.

    I have no idea about anything related to Makoto Shinkai or the expectations he had, I will not allow that to affect my criticism like several others. 
I consider it highly ""Overvalued"", my objective with this is to make sure that rationally it does not deserve or have an assessment close to what it has. 
 
The story, the most surprising thing was how easy I predicted the three sessions of the plot, the worst was the terrible development of the beginning or presentation, besides that it could be more entertaining, it did not have anything of relevance due to that the time of the work. 
During the development, the ""Remember Your Name"" overexploited that resource was used so repeatedly that until the title of the film, thanks to the lack of ideas. And about the outcome, Even the dialogues were predictable. Is that exciting? 
 
Regarding visual art there is not much to reflect, it was an impossible challenge not to be surprised by the excellence presented in the landscapes. 
 
The characters did not have an outstanding performance, but you can have affection, without taking into account the little dedication to make them better known. 
As I have nothing more to say I say that you can enjoy this work rather than one but there is a big problem and is the unnecessary overvaluation, there are better, less valued, and what follows the typical speech against the envelope assessment. 
If there is a problem of understanding due to the wrong expression or bad construction of the sentences I have the excuse that I have to translate it from my language to English, and it is not as easy as it seems.

    It's easier to conform than to stand out. This review will be abit different from other reviews since I will explain the kind of impact this beautiful OVA had on me. Origins did an excellent job at redesigning our childhood and the game into a short OVA. It was emotional for me and it really made me grip on certain things. Seeing red...it wasn't just a trip back to the RBY days,it was hell of a lot deeper than that. I understood that everything I've wanted to be is like red. The individual who sparkles,the guy that always shows kindness to others,is just,and doesn't give up on his goals. His humility bewildered me,I came to realize everything I've ever wanted to be as a person is basically red.  The Pokemon OVA was more of a spiritual journey for me than anything else. Starting as a rookie,lacking knowledge,not knowing the ways of the world. Then eventually slowly grinding your way to the top,hitting bumps as you go along,and sometimes hitting walls that you have to try to overcome. Sparkling with persistence, consistency,and ambition as you continue your struggle to reach your goals. The OVA did an amazing job at depicting who red was in only 4 episodes. I've come to realize by watching this OVA,that I have a long road ahead of me before I hit my goals. This OVA made me evaluate the kind of companions I want for the difficult journey of attaining my own goals,and thrills me with excitement as I await whoever im going to meet for the difficult adventure that lies in the future. By the end of this mini series,you cant help but be proud of red becoming a champion and one of the greatest trainers in the world. And it makes me excited when I dream of reaching a similar position to his,in whatever goal I'm aiming for. I give this series a 10/10 for its comprehensive portrayal of reds journey,and for inspiring me to evaluate myself. As a 22 year old man(if that's what you guys consider a man),I found both fulfillment and satisfaction in watching this anime. For those of you that like to use your time wisely and seek to enrich yourself with youthful splendor and inspiration,this OVA is a must. If you love Pokemon,this OVA is a must. For those who are inspired by this review, I hope you gain the same bountiful sense of joy when you watch it as I did. Peace.

    This is not an unbiased review, it is not even a review, is just what I didn`t like and why I dropped it. 
I just don`t like the yelling. I don`t like the characters, I don`t like the pace, the art, the soundtrack, the story and I dropped because of it, I don`t like the insane characters and the dumb protagonist, even if the ending clarify why they are like this I would still be annoyed by the insane characters (e.g. Rena), I become with this desire of buying a stun gun just so I can shoot all this characters in the face and see them in the ground peeing themselves.

    Merc Storia is a late adaptation of an ancient mobage, and as of right now, it’s one of the most overlooked anime of the fall season. I’m writing this review so I can convince you to give a chance to what I personally feel is the best anime of this season, and one of the best animes of 2018.  
 
Story/Characters: 
 
So here’s the premise: in this world, people and monsters are living together peacefully. However, not all monsters have been tamed. That why healers exist, whose job is to heal those monsters’ hearts. Our protagonist, Yuu – from “yuusha”, a.k.a. hero in English - is one of them, there’s just one problem: he’s deathly afraid of them, which makes his job quite complicated. And he’s a wimp in all regards anyway. And his sidekick, Merc, is just a tiny girl in a jar whose only power is to float and has lost her memory prior her encounter with Yuu. In the first episode, after a confrontation with one of those monsters, they begin their travelling through the country in order to find a way to restore Merc’s lost memory and for Yuu to overcome his fear.  
 
All this setup, which was the first episode, however, is just an excuse. Merc Storia, despite what the title suggests, is not mainly about Merc, but about the unique places they visit through their travels. These mini arcs consist of one or two episodes, and after their problems have been resolved – or partly resolved -, Yuu and Merc moves on to their next destination. And while they’re certainly helping, they’re only there to give an incentive for these mini arc’s main characters to solve their own problems themselves. And the story doesn't shy away from heavy topics: people’s role in their society according to their gender, a father not being able to connect with his own daughter, dealing with loss, keeping up appearances and self-worth, just to name a few. And as I’ve said, each place is very unique: for example, episode 8-9’s mini arc is a musical - I’m not kidding.  
 
And don’t expect heavy action. Our hero is not a fighter after all. And sometimes even the monsters themselves play little role in these mini arcs. But if you can get through the episodic premise, you get a damn good story. I ended up in tears multiple times; episode 6-7 is one big tearjerker, you’ll see what I’m talking about.  
 
Art: 
 
Animation is certainly not this series’ strong suit to be honest, but the backgrounds are gorgeous and more than make up for it, especially later in the series. The already mentioned episode 6-7 is one of the best examples of that.  
 
Music/Sound: 
 
Let’s start with my pet peeve: the sound effects of the monsters can be annoying and it’s not helping when you’re in the middle of a headache or a migraine. Now that I have this out of the way, I have nothing but praise. The OP, the ED, the background music: it gives the series an aura you could call “comfy” for a lack of a better world. And don’t forget the aforementioned musical episodes. They really outdid themselves on this front. 
 
Tl;dr: 
 
Merc Storia is a damn good story and if you can overlook some of its flaws, which has nothing to do with its writing, you'll get one of the best anime this year. Please don’t sleep on this one!

    Black Rock Shooter is from start to finish a down-right strange anime. I think it generally represents the idea that nice and kind people whose righteousness comes straight from their hearts will always help people even if it costed them their night’s sleep or their current happiness. It also threw hints about Freud’s psychoanalysis; how there is a netherworld, where people’s suppressed emotions are converted into restless champions in constant battle. I will not deny that it does this in a very strange way, which is good, because even if this looks typical to the naked eye, it is far from it. 
 
The anime ends in an ambiguous manner, leaving you questioning whether the anime had a meaning or a lesson, or was just for entertainment. 
 
There’s the start, and there is the finish, surely. But what happens in between is where all the good stuff’s at! And it is nothing less than magnificent. 
 
There is something here for everyone: 
Epic battles, check. 
Authentic emotions, check. 
Excellent animation, check. 
Twisted characters, check. 
Atmospheric music, check. 
THE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY, check, check, check! 
 
Hell, everything was inspiring. 
 
The anime is short (only 8 eps., 25 minutes per ep.), but that is not a bad thing; it feels better that way, because had they made it any longer, it would end up depressing you. It’s atmospheric, alright. 
 
My only complaint is that it does not feel, only for the main antagonists, the twisted characters who are really sinister, have a decent excuse for them to be so. 
However, all the characters are in a good way overdramatic. 
 
The plot isn’t very much engaging, but you’ll be compelled by the extra fine battles, and the responses and reactions of characters. And if that doesn’t appeal to you, just kickback, and let at all the colorful worlds, and the very nice music take you for a ride.

    day 8234709 of being single: watches makura no danshi 
 
makura no danshi pros: 
- a quick + easy watch for when you want to laugh and cry 
- not your typical horror movie but will horrify you all the same 
- the voice actors are alright, even if there’s not a huge amount of emotion in their voices 
- i guess it’s making up for the lack of fanservice tailored towards girls 
- a variety of characters (they have little actual personality but it’s to be expected with such short episodes) 
- unique :// hairstyles 
- character of ep11 recognises he is a disgrace with “i am the king of kings of creepy guys!”  
 
makura no danshi cons: 
- op takes up around 1/4 of a 4min episode  
- the characters never blink it’s horrific 
- there’s something weird about the art, it’s just a lil unnerving 
- a lot of each episode is literally just one still frame,,,, 10/10 for “animation” 
- (you can tell about 0.1 effort was put into this) 
- sometimes it goes really close up to their face and it makes you want to cry; contrary to popular belief, people do not throw their bodies very close and then very far to those they are talking to 
- no soundtrack at all apart from the theme song made especially noticeable by: a) the awkward silences and b) episode three he tells you to listen to his song and there’s just nothingness (deep.) 
- really awkward silences, dora gone wrong. made worse when there’s literally nothing you can say even if you were feeling engaged. 
- the art includes a lower lip but no upper lip which is downright stressful 
- for a show named “pillow boys”, there’s only one character which is in a bed. click baited once again. 
- episode 10 gave me more of the feeling the characters were going to rape me than gently help me sleep  
- no clue what age group it's tailored for: one character's canonly 12, another is probably in his thirties? 
 
overall:  
- makura no danshi goes between “this is so bad it’s entertaining” and “this is so extraordinarily bad it’s not even entertaining anymore” 
- the art makes it a horror movie 
- would recommend for someone blind 
- the synopsis is a better read than this show is a watch

    Before the review, I would like to say that I am not fluent in English, so I translated my text by Google Translator, sorry if there is a mistake. 
 
Honestly, it could be much better the anime, I think the only people who would like it and yet more or less would be the people who have already played King of fighters, for those who do not know, KOF is an anime about the game of the same name, not much liked the episodes Because in addition to having about 6 minutes, apparently has a lot of history to be counted in a few episodes. Moreover, it seemed that they took random stories and played only for the fans of the game, never played the games, but I would really like to understand the story by the anime, unfortunately they did not make a way to all understand their plot. Anyway, I recommend watching only those who know the game, and yet to know that the anime is not there such things.

    This is a short anime I found really enjoyable. At the beginning, I found it confusing but after looking into the details and plot of the game it is based off, it was easy to understand the gist of it. Touken Ranbu Hanamaru focuses on the daily lives of a bunch of sword boys and how they interact with each other. This anime just shows the viewers what happens in their daily lives - something not seen much in the game. 
 
The amount of characters and trying to remember all of their names was a challenge though, as most has long and complicated names, but after some time, you could basically recognise the character anywhere due to their unique characteristics. 
 
The music was nice and though it was not the most memorable, it was still recognisable. The art style, however was outstanding. Most anime character designs are simple so it would not take too long to draw but there is a lot of detail and effort put into designs, especially being able to have scenes where the characters are in their intricately designed battle gear. 
 
The anime was funny and had many moments where you could just laugh at the characters getting up to no good or just generally doing their own thing. Besides being just a slice of life comedy, there are some action parts like battles and serious moments. 
 
There is a lot of character development and history behind the characters that may not be explained in the game and it is commendable that it is done in such a short series. The episodes are split up into two parts and showcases the different antics of characters which gives them a fair amount of screen time rather than a few seconds and the rest to the main character, however, the main character does get more time but that is to be expected. 
 
The anime does need some knowledge of some important Japanese historical figures and events but other than that and the idea of the actual plot in the game, this anime can be easily understood and enjoyable.

    I am surprised no one has written a review of this anime yet. Its kind of intimidating being the first one to write a review about a classic Anime like Lupin the third Part 2. 
 
Well lets get onto the review.The plot is about the adventures of famous thief lupin the third and his partners Jigen ( one of the best marksman in the world) Goemon (the samurai and thief that can even cut steel) And Fujiko ( a beautiful thief spy who often betrays Lupin and his partners) There is no real overall story just like Lupin Part 1 its basically episodic unless there is a two part special (which is rare but good). Its more light hearted than the first series and from what I heard also the manga. The first series was kind dark gritty and action packed, but Lupin the Third part two has more humor and a lot more operations based on stealing. It also has some serious moments that make the episodes good. 
 
The art is excellent for it time and I think it aged well. You can also tell that some of the newer anime might have gotten some of their inspiration from the character designs notably Lupin and Goemon. Also the background scenery from different places around the world look really good. 
 
Sound. The sound is amazing from the explosions to the car chases everything is done well. The best thing about the sound is the music they Got this Jazz thing going and it works really well for the series and they know how use the music and how to time it. The seiyuus are the best part of the anime, they don't miss a beat and really work well together and take their own character to a new level even some bad episodes are watchable cause of them. 
  
The Characters are best the thing about the series I believe. 
Lupin The Third- Greatest thief in the world, also really hard to kill and catch. only weakness though is women mainly Fujiko. 
Daisuke Jigen- The best marksmen of the group he is also pretty kool himself. He is also doesn't trust Fujiko. 
Goemon- The strongest swordsman in the world and he can cut anything even steel. he is very loyal and follows his own honor code. He also doesn't trust Fujiko. 
Fujiko- A sexy thief, spy and a traitor usually to Lupin. Always looking to get Lupins skills involved and then rip him off. She knows she can get away with it since Lupin is madly in love with her or just really attracted to her. 
Zenigata- the man that chases Lupin with limited success but never gives up. Always there to make it harder for Lupin and the Gang. 
The kool thing about the characters other than their skills and style is that they have a great bond and have each others backs (even fujiko sometimes) and they rather die than betray each other it really shows in certain episodes. 
 
I really enjoyed the series but i am not going to lie there are some episodes that flat out bored me but I think it might have to do with the person who directed those certain episodes. The humor is great but I do wish there was more blood and more episodes about people trying assassinate Lupin the Third or one of his Partners. Really enjoyable though if you looking for something to kickback and enjoy some laughs and clever heists and not think to much about. 
 
Overall i gave it a 9 I easily give high scores and I know that but I resisted giving this a 10 because some episodes were just not that good, but I still gave it a 9 because it is a classic and one of my favorites.

    For this anime there is only three words that i can this that fit this anime, what the F$$$. The storyline like is broken up soo much it makes no sence. One of the protagonists is always depressed and is always negative no matter the cost and the fact it went from mahou shojo to mecha makes me wonder what type of anime it was

    Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood aka Hagaren is a MASTERPIECE.  
 
I’m not saying that FMA: Brotherhood is a ‘Perfect’ anime but I haven’t seen any which would be at par to the great experience this anime has given me. I’m not a fan of science, military or shounen but Hagaren perfectly mixed these genre to suit my liking. I love how there is fantasy in military, drama in action, science in history and comedy in a tragedy.  
 
The darkness and brightness of the story is balanced. One thing that made me really love this anime is that, there are no fillers at all. Each side stories are deeply connected to the main plot. The 64-long series was never boring. I got so hooked I can’t even wait for the next episode to come out.  
 
The two main protagonists, Edward and Alphonse, are likeable. I hated Edward at first because of what happens to their bodies but as the story progress, I ended up cheering for the brothers. There are many characters in Hagaren but all of them has a significant role. Everyone help the protagonists discover the secret of alchemy.  
 
I love the animation. I’m not really picky with art but Bones did Hagaren so there’s nothing more to say. The voice actors/actresses did their part really well. Each voice match perfectly with the characters’ personalities. The expression and feelings are well delivered. The soundtrack is also great with YUI, SCANDAL and Shouko Nakagawa songs in it. I like how they change the OP and ED theme to match with the current ‘chapter’ of the series. Everything goes well together and it gets you really in the mood.  
 
I definitely enjoyed Hagaren. The excitement, the tears, the thrill and suspense, the mystery and tragedy will forever be missed. Though I felt that the 24-minute episodes are kinda short, each episode still has the depth I’m looking for in an anime episode. I enjoy the roller coaster feel from episode 1 to episode 64. This anime is worth the watch and re-watch. I don’t remember how many times I watched this but even so, I never got bored and the same feelings resurfaces everytime I re-watch this.  
 
Overall, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood or Hagaren will still hold the TOP spot in my list. It may have some flaws but truth is, no anime has ever get to the same level of Hagaren.

      ""No amount of great animation will save a bad story.""-John Lasseter 
 
   When news came out that Kyoto Animation was going to make a supernatural anime me like many others were surprised and excited. A supernatural show with great animation made by one of the most popular anime studios in japan? What could possibly go wrong with Kyoukai No Kanata? Almost everything,apparently. 
 
   The story is set in a fictional world where Supernatural creatures called Youmu exist. Youmu come in various shapes and sizes. Although most Youmu are harmless. Some could be hostile and dangerous. To stop these Youmu from harming humans there exists spirit world warriors, warriors with special powers who kill dangerous Youmu and keep balance to the world. The story revolves around Half youmu, Akihiro Kanbaru who saves a girl named Kuriyama Mirai, a spirit world warrior with the power to control her blood. 
 
   Sounds promising right? What went wrong? The first problem with Kyoukai No Kanata is its lack of direction. Kyoukai No Kanata is supposed to be a dark fantasy. But as the show progresses to the middle the show feels like more like a slice of life with a bit of comedy than a dark anime. The biggest offense is the idol episode. An episode that is pretty much a fan pandering episode in an attempt to boost sales. That may have boosted sales. But after that episode I really couldn't take this anime seriously anymore. 
 
   Apart from that there are also other problems with the story. But alot of times there is alot of unneccesary humor. I mean, a few laughs here and there are fine but too much just kills the atmosphere of the show. And it would have helped if the comedy was actually funny. But most of the comedy came up at the wrong time and felt forced.  
 
   The characters aren't much better either. There are 4 main characters of the show. Kanbaru Akihito, Kuriyama Mirai, Nase Mitsuki, and Nase Hiroomi. Kyoto Animations signature character designs look great. Mirai looks as cute as ever with her glasses and the others looked quite nice too. But looking deeper into them. They all feel one sided. Aside from her moe character design and clumsy personality there really isn't much to her. She doesn't do anything to stand out and I really couldn't relate to her at all. Akihito isn't good either. His glasses obsession is really annoying and pretty much the only thing that makes him different from other characters. The chemistry between them is also pretty lacking and one can only wonder if Akihito actually likes Mirai for her or for her glasses. The Nase siblings aren't remotely interesting either. So excuse me for not writing about them because there really isn't much to write about. 
 
   On a brighter note the Animation is quite detailed which is quite expected from Kyoto Animation. The backgrounds are all done beautifully. Character designs all looked great. The action scenes were also done nicely. But one small thing that I noticed is that Kyoto Animation is still slightly inexperienced in battle scenes. Although most of the movements were fluid some of the camera angles felt a bit awkward. This doesn't detract too much from the whole experience but I can't help think that with that amount of budget the battle scenes could have looked better.  
 
   The sound is also very good. Minori Chihara brings off an outstanding opening ""Kyoukai No Kanata"". An opening that fit with the show quite well. The ending song ""Daisy"" is also a very nice song done by Stereo Dive Foundation. The soundtrack also fit the show well. Everything from the action scenes to the comedy scenes were all fit with nice pieces. If only the story was as good as the sound... 
 
   Kyoukai No Kanata was a major disappointment for me. Not because of how bad it was. But because of what it could have been. Kyoukai No Kanata had alot of potential. But bad execution and bland characters stopped it from becoming something truly special.

    This is the last anime that needs another review, but I couldn’t resist. The Fullmetal Alchemist franchise’s significance to anime is rivaled only by shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop. The original version from 2003 stands as one of my favourite series of all time, as it is one of the most well rounded shows that I’ve seen in the anime medium, and I believe it’s a must watch for all anime fans.  
 
Fast forward to 2009, when Bones released Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, a faithful remake to the manga, which was still being written while the 2003 version was being released (which led to the overall plot diverging from the manga). Brotherhood has been critically acclaimed, and has often been considered superior to its 2003 counterpart. While I believe that it’s a fantastic show (and believe me – if the million fanboys/girls squealing isn’t enough, let me tell you that Brotherhood is AMAZING), and it does indeed do a few things better than the 2003 version, it does fall short in a few areas. 
 
(Note that comparisons to the 2003 version will be present, because hey, it’s inevitable.)  
 
Plot/Presentation 
So Brotherhood follows the source material more faithfully. Does that automatically mean it’s better? Well, yes and no. One of the main criticisms against 2003 is that it diverged from the original plotline of the manga. While the original source material had some magnificent content, the mere fact that Brotherhood is more faithful doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s better.  
 
Let’s start with the flaws first. The first 10 or so episodes are extremely rushed, and, to be frank, shitty. Pivotal moments that build not only the foundation of the entire plot, but also key moments in the development for a few main characters, felt hurried, and I couldn’t feel the dramatic tension of the situations at all.  
 
I honestly hated Brotherhood at that point, but it eventually got better. The director eventually found a consistent pace that worked for the show. It was still fast paced and incredibly engaging, but it slowed down just enough for the show the flow naturally. 
 
The main problem with the entirety of the show is the comedy. The manga had lots of comedy, and though I haven’t read all of the series, the comedy worked decently well to an extent. The show tries to copy the manga’s humour, and it just doesn’t work when brought to life on the screen. A lot of the tender and dramatic moments of the show are completely destroyed by characters suddenly jumping into chibi form for a quick laugh. The transitions between the drama and comedy in Brotherhood is horrendous and above all, inappropriate. Plus, the recurring jokes get way too old way too fast (e.g. people teasing Ed about his height is funny at first, but loses its effect).  
 
The world of FMA can be rather… dark, and it’s beyond me why such inappropriate comedy is placed in the most out of place situations. Luckily, like my issue with the pacing, the humour eventually became a bit tamer, but it still irked me at times. 
 
Remember how I said that the mere fact that the show follows the manga more faithfully doesn’t mean that it’s better?  
 
The 2003 version saw this, and it did its best to tone down the humour just enough for the show to feel more genuine. It still had the wacky FMA slapstick that everyone loves, but unlike Brotherhood, it was saved for when it wouldn’t interrupt with pivotal dramatic/emotional moments.  
However, it’s not to say Brotherhood does a bad job with its tender bits either. When it’s done right, it’s done well.  
 
Now before you rage on me and rate my review ‘not helpful’, keep in mind that I still gave this show an 8/10. This show has much redeeming value, hell, plenty of it.  
 
The entirety of the story revolves around the theme of ‘Brotherhood’, like the title suggests. You see this with both the protagonists and the antagonists. You see this bond with the Elric brothers, the military, with Fort Briggs, and even with the homunculi.  
 
The plot itself, while having some issues with its presentation, has the word ‘epic’ written all over it. The world of FMA is a grand one, and so are the rules of alchemy, which is what makes this show special in the fantasy genre. Alchemy is not magic – to obtain, one must give something of equal value (The Law of Equivalent Exchange). There are many rules of alchemy, and as the show progresses, you learn more about alchemy itself and its effect on other people, both positively and negatively.  
 
This is one of the most daring shows I’ve seen in any medium ever, as it goes beyond what the fantasy genre is usually capable of. Brotherhood has a monster of a plot, and somehow it manages to handle its many plot threads with care without seeming convoluted. Each and every subplot receives closure (for the most part) and they all have their impact on the story at large. This is hands down the best part about and so this show deserves praise for that. 
 
Overall, the plot has it all. It’s complex, fascinating, fun, and engaging. Unfortunately, the few but major flaws took a toll on my rating.  
 
Characters 
For me, what I love most about the world of FMA is the characters. The story begins with the tragic tale of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, two of my favourite characters in anime.   
 
Edward is the daring brother, the taker of chances, and the intuitive genius of alchemy for his age. He’s strong, he’s flawed, and he is the famous Fullmetal Alchemist. Alphonse is the one who stops and thinks, and throughout the story, he wishes to prove his worth and be more useful to everyone. He can be considered as the moral compass in the entire cast. What I absolutely adore about their relationship is how much they want to save each other before themselves. Edward has lost an arm and a leg, and Alphonse has lost his entire body and is forced to live in a suit of armour, yet all they care about is each other. You can’t ask for better leads like these two. They develop and flesh out nicely as the story goes on. Few relationships can be so tragic, beautiful, and touching.  
 
Brotherhood has a huge cast of side characters, and somehow manages to give the majority of them enough screentime for each of them to leave an impact on me. All the characters have their own motives, relationships, and place in the story at large, and you get to see it all.  
 
Certain characters’ roles and relationships were enlarged in Brotherhood, making their presence far more significant then in the 2003 version. For example, Winry is not only bigger a character in Brotherhood, but her relationship with Edward in particular is far more fleshed out. Winry keeps him grounded. You see her take care of his injuries, scold him, tease him, and most importantly, fall in love with him.  
 
I could go on and on about the characters, but I’ll let you learn about them yourselves. Overall, Brotherhood has a memorable, fantastic, and well used cast 
 
Art/Animation 
Bones, you beast of a studio. It’s a wonder how consistent the animation is from Episode 1 to 64. Most long running anime tend to lose its steam when it comes to production values as the show goes on.  
Not Brotherhood.  
 
While the animation is not always perfect, it’s still crisp, clear, and consistent. Considering the show’s length, its consistency is an achievement in itself. Equal time and care is also put in the character designs. All of the characters are definable, vivid, and full of life. The background scenery can be absolutely stunning to boot.  
 
The fight scenes range from boring to extremely mind blowing (particularly fights involving Mustang and the final showdown). However, FMA was never about the action, so I can’t really complain, as I feel that it would’ve let the show down if it were more action-oriented.  
 
The only complaint I have, albeit a minor one, is the use of lighting. It can seem a bit flat at times, but overall, this show is very visually pleasing to the eye. 
 
Music/Voice Acting 
When it comes to the music, the openings and endings are where Brotherhood shines. I’ve yet to see OP’s and ED’s so memorable, gripping, and energetic. I loved each and every one of them except for the 3rd OP and ED. Even though I don’t usually listen to Japanese music, I loved the songs. Plus, when the songs are also used as inserts during any given episode, it brings the biggest smile to my face. Standouts go to OP 1 and 4 and ED 2, which is a touching pop ballad called ‘Let it Out’. Even though I couldn’t understand the lyrics without translation, it still brought a few tears to my eyes. 
 
The soundtrack itself is very solid one. There is a wide range in this soundtrack, from upbeat to suspenseful, and the soundtrack is used well. I’ve no complaints.  
 
FMA has been considered to be among the shows that have superior dubs than most in anime, and honestly, I could see why. There isn’t a single miscast here, and every one of the VA’s played their role amazingly well. For example, I was a little hesitant to hear that Alphonse’s VA was replaced, but all that hesitation withered away after I heard Maxey Whitehead’s portrayal of him. Her performance came of just as genuine as Aaron Dismuke’s. 
 
It’s hard to pick out standouts, mainly because every VA went beyond the call of duty with these characters. I loved this dub that much.  
 
Conclusion 
 
After a rather disappointing start, Brotherhood more than makes up for it, as it becomes a huge rollercoaster ride until its epic finale and touching conclusion. With a plot that screams epic, fantastic characters, masterful production values, and an eargasmic dub, I wish I could rate this show higher. I really do. However, the few flaws were unfortunately major ones, and they took a huge toll on the show as a whole. Consistent pacing and tone are two important building blocks that form a solid story, and unfortunately Brotherhood lacks in both areas. Nevertheless, don’t let these flaws stop you from watching this show, as it more than makes up for it. If you haven’t watched anything from the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, I suggest watching the 2003 version first and then watching Brotherhood.  
 
Now before I close the longest review I’ve ever written, I’d like to address one commonly asked question in the anime community: is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood worthy enough to be ranked #1 on MAL? While I do not believe Brotherhood is THE BEST ANIME EVER, I will say it’s among the greats, and its universal appeal is undeniable. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood captures what anime is and the great heights of which this medium is capable of. I couldn’t think of another show that is more worthy than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be the face of anime.   
 
Now, me being a FMA fanboy, this gigantic review only scrapes the surface of all my thoughts and feelings. Am I being overly positive? Am I being unfair? If you want to take this discussion further, feel free to leave feedback/comments on my profile! This is StillSwingin007, and thanks for reading my review!

For you see, One Room is unparalleled in undermining any rational expectation from its audience; few anime series have disappointed as consistently and as vigorously as One Room. I’ve never seen a show blatantly resist originality, creativity, and artistic integrity quite like One Room. At first glance, One Room appears to be yet another cash cow representative of the harem genre, a product engineered from the assembly line to satisfy the masses. On further examination, however, One Room is revealed to be the culmination of Studio TYPHOON embarking on the shortest, easiest, most effortless route to success. In a medium where laziness has become the norm, One Room has taken this standard to unfathomable extremes. It is, without a doubt, the master of cutting corners. 
 
Like every other work belonging to the harem genre, One Room is about a self-insert protagonist (read: a one-dimensional, vaguely likable cardboard cutout of a high school student with a lack of assertiveness) and his attempts to aid the women in his life. A fairly interesting plot structure (one woman per three-episode arc, totaling three arcs for 12 episodes) with the potential to elevate its storyline into a cohesive work of art is undermined by an utter lack of focus. Every halfhearted attempt at conveying anything remarkable is obscured by an overwhelming amount of meaningless endeavors: the “incest is wincest” angle, the blushing and the stammering, the unnecessary monologues about what an awesome guy the protagonist is, and (of course) the lengthy T&A shots. Every sluggish grasp at individual depth is marred by an unwillingness to present anything that might be lurking beneath the cutesy character designs. Each episode has a five minute runtime, which simultaneously compounds on the issues and provides Studio TYPHOON with an alibi for their complete lack of effort. It’s because of One Room’s runtime that the production company’s executives can pat themselves on the back, and say to themselves, “Well, we WOULD make this project of ours somewhat worthwhile but, you know, we just didn’t have enough time.” 
 
That, my friends, is inexcusable. 
 
Even if there isn’t an option to extend the episode length to the standard 23 minutes, that still doesn’t permit you to put forth the bare minimum at your job. It’s possible to have an anime series with five minutes per episode, and still provide a memorable, enjoyable experience for the audience. I mean, look at Bonobono. It’s currently airing with 50 episodes and counting, and it has yet to disappoint. However, with One Room, the only reason why there hasn’t been a tidal wave of outrage is due to the show’s cinematography, or rather, its first-person point of view shot. 
 
That’s right; the principal source of One Room’s popularity isn’t a relatively unique art style (this show’s animation can hardly be described as “unique”; it’s more lackluster than anything else), a memorable insert song (any ED that lasts for 25 seconds isn’t worth mentioning) nor the financial backing of a prominent production company (One Room is Studio TYPHOON’s first project). No; the method in which the presentation is displayed is the only cause of One Room’s acclaim. As a reviewer with an adoration for cinematic flair, I have written fondly of anime titles that effectively utilize camera angles but I never considered that to be a main attraction. Employing the POV shot as your central selling point is like a car company declaring its visual appeal to be the best feature of its products. Sure, it’s pretty useful to have, and rather convenient at that, but in no way is it essential. For the videogame industry, for shooting games in particular, the 1st-person point of view shot is a must-have. For anime, however, using it as consistently as One Room causes your project to come across as a novelty act, a gimmick above all else. Yes, these are the depths to which One Room has sunken the standard of excellence. 
 
The biggest grievance I have with One Room is its tendency to discover willowy slivers of potential before immediately mishandling it in epic proportions. Its mildly catchy insert song is not only inserted at the wrong time but its appearance is brief as well. Its moments involving the cherry blossom trees are, strangely, the moments in which One Room’s aesthetics are at their apex, and yet these occur once in a blue moon. Its panning shots of the surroundings are the greatest usages of the 1st person POV, but One Room dedicates more time to its lifeless dialogue than anything else. Really, the examples are endless when it comes to One Room but the biggest example has to be its forgettable cast obliterating any shred of redeemability. Pointless Love Interest No.1 is the girl next door while Pointless Love Interest No.2 is the tsundere/little sister and Pointless Love Interest No.3 is the childhood friend. All three of them are virtually rendered obsolete beyond their surface identity; these vapid vessels of femininity can cook, clean, blush, stammer, and whisper sweet nothings like no other, yet they struggle to convey a thought of their own. None of them, however, are worse than the protagonist himself. 
 
Thanks to the POV angle, it is from the protagonist’s eyes that we are able to view the show. If there ever was an opportunity for an anime title to redefine the self-insert MC, this was it….. and that’s what amplifies my disappointment. Believe it or not, I can forgive his passive nature, his shallow selflessness, even his inability to speak. However, the Nameless Protagonist’s unsettling ogling over the other girls (even his own sister!), and One Room’s fascination for hammering the ""protag is a perv” angle into our skulls, is where I draw the line. The average anime company crafts their self-insert MC based on how they perceive their audience, as you likely know. The socially awkward high school perv is hardly revolutionary in anime but what’s frustrating about One Room’s pervy self-insert protag in particular is that he possesses no facial features, no body parts, nothing. 
 
The difference between One Room and every other harem anime is that other studios present their MC, and say, “This is a general impression of what we think our viewers are”; on the other hand, when Studio TYPHOON presents their MC, it’s as if they’re saying, “This is a representation of you.” 
 
Not only am I enraged at Studio TYPHOON’s patronizing manner but the lack of a reaction among One Room’s viewers about this is infuriating as well. 
 
If Hand Shakers really is the worst anime series of the Winter 2017 season, then One Room is far and away the second. 
 
By any thorough analysis, rating scale, or statistical calculation, it’s inconceivable to witness this utter deprivation of quality, and deem it “worthwhile”. 
 
When One Room isn’t thematically shallow, it’s cringeworthy. 
When One Room isn’t cringeworthy, it’s blatantly aimless.  
When One Room isn’t blatantly aimless, it’s emotionally stunted. 
When One Room isn’t emotionally stunted, it’s completely condescending. 
 
And if “completely condescending” is what you require to sate your anime-viewing appetite, then you’ll be downright ecstatic to know that One Room will return for the Spring `17 season, with a sequel and a special. Yes, screw longevity! Studio TYPHOON’s milking this cash cow as if they too realize that its 15 minutes of fame has an impending expiration date. I’m sure there will be plenty that will gleefully tune in every week for another episode of the shamelessly contrived, strikingly pandering, and unconditionally conceited money maker that is One Room, once again hailing it as “innovative” and “unique” when it is anything but. 
 
As for me, I’ve heard enough “onii-chans” to last a lifetime.

    Lucky star. This was not my very first anime, more like my second. When I wanted to watch it was on October 25, 2012, when I was looking at Fukkireta videos and I saw Kagami's and I was like ""Meh, why not?"" and that is how I got into anime. I did not get most of the references in Lucky star but I still enjoyed it. 
 
Story (7/10) 
 
The story is about four girls who go to a Japanese high school. They talk about random things and go to places. Near the end of every episode there is a mini-show called Lucky Channel, where Akira Kogami, and her sidekick Minoru also talk about random things. 
 
Characters (10/10) 
 
The characters were pretty nicely developed. Konata, is an otaku gamer (Like me :3) Kagami, the shy, tsundere. Tsukasa, the clumsy, and Miyuki, the sweetie deredere. All four make up the fun of the anime. 
 
Art (10/10) 
 
The art was fabulous. When I watched it the art was how I could tell it was an anime. Hair color, eyes, body shape. All were so cute. The art was pretty cool. 
 
Sound (8/10) 
 
The sound was pretty good. I watched Lucky Star in the English dub and I have to say that the dub was amazing. The characters had cool voices. The music was interesting too. The Lucky Channel music was my favorite. 
 
Overall (8/10) 
 
It was very cool. Although I get most of the references today, it's even more enjoyable. I hope you liked my review!

    Idaten Jump is one of my favorite anime of my childhood. The show introduced me to Mountain Biking, an amazing sport. Unlike other anime, this one is a bit focused on younger children and teenagers.  
The show focus on a young boy, Sho Yamato and his two friends who like Mountain Biking. Mysteriously, one day while racing with their friends they somehow sucked into another world and their new exciting adventure to return to their home begins.  
Their journey is filled with great encounters as they head towards the legendary racing city.  
The one great thing about this anime is the chemistry between the three main characters. The antagonists in the story are also praiseworthy so are the supporting characters.  
Not only it was entertaining but it also taught me some very important things about life and principles.  
 
Well, this is the first time I'm writing a review so I  will keep it short. Pardon me if you see any mistake. And I hope you will enjoy Idaten Jump as I did.

    ""Zetman"", the story of genetically engineered ""creatures"" who fight for the amusement of powerful men. The story is simple, clean, and to the point. There is nothing overly deep here, but there doesn't need to be. For a 13 episode series ""Zetman"" was loads of fun and not as predictable as one may think. Sure the characters were cliche but the direction in which the story takes us was fresh and fulfilling. Most questions were answered by the last episode and the ones that weren't didn't really important.  
 
The character models were really well done. Facial expressions were well defined, noses were realistically shaped and, lips were plump and rounded. However, color could have been used more rigorously while structural art was utterly forgettable with the exception of one or two scenes. 
 
The opening theme is hit or miss. I enjoyed its simplicity and like Little John had little substance but nevertheless was fun to listen to. Ending theme was in my opinion very dull. BGM was okay and got a little better towards the end of the series as tensions rose. 
 
It's important to take into account the brevity of the series as character development was hard pressed in a 13 episode action oriented anime. With that being said we see a very plot driven series whose character faults are forgivable.  
 
Overall I would definitely recommend ""Zetman"" for someone who doesn't want to invest too much time but still wants to be entertained.

    Clannad ~after story~ is Clannad's continuation and is what you can call a ''masterpiece''. In this review, i won't redo the art, sound because it is the same as the first season 
 
Story:10/10 
The one and only section that the first season didn't get a full mark. After story offers us a continuity to the first season and to the love that blossomed during the first season. This second season outshines the first because it focuses on Tomoya and his relationship with Nagisa. This show offer us an happily ever after that is not always happy. In fact, this couple has to overcome hurdles that anyone can live through while maintaining what made the first season a success (a mix of reality with a hint of fantastical event). 
 
Character:10/10 
The show keeps the same cast but the story focuses on four character being Tomoya, Nagisa and her parents while (minor spoiler) a new character gets introduced later on. 
 
Enjoyment:10/10 
In my review of the first season, I gave enjoyment a 10/10 and I gave the second season the same grade but in total honesty the second season was just out of this world and form episode 9 to the end of the show one cannot stop watching, it is just that good. Plus the outstanding storyboard made me cry and laugh and cry and laugh and cry and laugh... till the end of the show. I found myself on an emotional rollercoaster which shows how much I enjoyed the show 
 
Overall:10/10 
This is the best anime i've ever come across protraying not a stereotypical character, but a young man trying to overcome life's obstacle with the woman he loves, it is nothing more and nothing less than that. A beautiful, life-changing, inspirational story that takes it viewer to a voyage in one's heart during though time.

    kaze ga is the anime i didn't know i was missing. i've dabbled in some sports anime here and there, but only few capture my attention enough to keep me hooked for the whole series 
 
story - 8/10 
the story itself is nothing mind blowing, pretty standard for the sports genre. something that sets this series apart is that the characters are experiencing college/apartment life, something i feel we don't get to see enough in anime. outside of that, the story follows the passionate team captain trying, and struggling, to motivate the rest of his team. i do give props to any show that can take a seemingly boring premise and inject so much life into it. 
 
art - 10/10 
the art has been beautiful since the start of the show, and now at the halfway mark, it is still going strong. the color palette, the character designs, the backgrounds, all gorgeous and diverse. 
 
sound - 10/10 
i feel like the sound in this show just isn't being appreciated enough! the op and ed are great in their own right, but the OST is amazing. it blends perfectly with the show, while not slipping too far into the background. yuki hayashi never disappoints 
 
character - 10/10 
even though there are 10 characters that share a pretty large amount of screen time together, they all stand out as individuals (except for maybe the twins, lol). the camaraderie between characters usually plays a big factor into what gets me into a show, and that continues to be the case here. from episode one, the banter and blooming interpersonal relationships have had their hooks in me and have only gotten deeper since 
 
enjoyment - 10/10 
started a little slow at first, but since the first 3-4 episodes, i've been having a blast watching every single week 
 
overall - 10/10 
give this show the attention it deserves!!!

    Hinamatsuri, a new slice of life made by studio feel, is certainly a breath of fresh air in the spring 2018 season. The story and characters are one of its strong points and it gets to a point where the viewer can feel the same emotions as the characters on screen. I would heartily recommend this anime if you are the type that enjoys fun, easygoing anime with lots of character building.  
 
First of all, story and plot. 'Plot' is something that is usually invisible in a slice of life anime and Hinamatsuri is no exception. However, it does not mean it is boring or uninteresting. Each episode brings something new to the table and I for one was engrossed in it till the very end. On the flipside, this show feels very rushed. The backstory is almost nonexistent and some characters are forgotten in the ensuing episodes. 
 
Next, art and sound. The animation feels fluid and the art style is great as expected of an anime produced in 2018. The sound, on the other hand, was pretty mediocre. The soundtrack was not very memorable but the OP and ED songs were pretty decent. The voice actor all captured their roles spectacularly so it's a 7 overall. 
 
Finally, the best part of this anime. Each character is likable and has a distinct personality that helps progress the story. Character development is superb and it doesn't waste time in doing it. You can almost feel like the characters are realistic and alive. The emotions are conveyed perfectly by the artists and voice actors and it actually hurts when the best girl Anzu sheds tears and you feel happy when Hina smiles her cute and innocent smile. 
 
In conclusion, I believe this show deserves all and even more attention than it gets. It would have been better if there were more episodes but the existing 12 certainly did a great job of entertaining me. A final warning DONT watch this anime if you like action shounen or high adrenaline fighting shows.

Aki-Sora is a incest anime. Yes incest anime. It seems in japan they like incest and that's why there is a category just for incest anime.  
 
Although, i'm not experienced with incests, this was my first. But i do know at least that this one is not good.  
 
Story (6/10). We have a brother and a sister. They get in love. They have a lot of sex. End of story. That's it? Yes the story is this one. Well for one episode it is quite long. We can consider it a copy of a romance, but the only thing different is that they are brothers.  
 
The other part of the thing is ... this anime is classified as ""Ecchi"", do you know what it is? From japanese it stands for sexual scenes. Pervert stuff. This anime is the closest thing i saw to a Hentai (anime pornography). For those who like this, this one isn´t good either. The girl is not that hot(at least here, in the OVA she is pretty damn hot) and the sex scenes are censured, so if you look for sex don´t watch this anime. I mean they show us some boobs but they don´t go any further.   
 
Sound (6/10). Well, well, there is nothing to say. It has only one episode long with half of the time about sex so.. it stands for normal sound. The opening it's ""okay"" for it's purpose, personaly, there is no big deal here.  
 
Art(7/10). I found the art to be quite good. The characters look nice, plus the background detail is good enough to give us a nice perspective of the enviroment(in the sex scenes to).   
 
Character (6/10). If it wasn´t for the 5 min of development that we see, there would be no characters. Just sex. Although for 20 min long and an Ecchi anime, we actually have a nice romance story. Of course nothing compared to the normal romance but stills reasonable.  
Aki, the female character, it's a normal student. She is good at everything in school, she is pretty but nothing on her is different from the rest of the animes out there. The guy .. the usual. The shy guy that can´t move forward so it has to be the girl to take the first step. As i said, pretty much the same as in the other romance stories. 
 
Overall, if you want to get some excitment and try a bit of incest, you can watch this one. As i said, the sex is censured so don´t get me wrong when i talked about sex. We have it, but the ""parts"" are censured if you know what i mean. I don´t reccomend it at all for underaged since well it is not for your age (:. If you never saw such thing as an Hentai or semi-hentai(Ecchi) and you are used to good and lovely romances, STAY AWAY. There are some dirty stuff here that might not please you. So do yourself a favor and stay away. If you already watched some ecchi animes or even hentais, you may try this one.

    Sometimes you want to slow down from your shonen butt clenching, flahsback having, annoying voiced, thick action fun and have some feel good moments. At that i would have to say is the best phrase to sum up Barakamon.  Good feeling fun. 
 
The intro alone let me know just how much i was going to enjoy nearly all of the characters and relationships. (namely the one between our protagonist Sei and Naru) Personally i have a warm place in my heart for shows that teach a little bit of how to find yourself with the help of people you wouldnt expect. If you dont care for slice of life-ish shows you might want to avoid it i guess, but then again it does follow an actual story with emotional tension to it, so it bridges the gap a little bit. The only character i didnt really like was the newbe artist who is introduced halfway through the show. He is helpful for showing an immature view that our hero might have had when he was a younger and aspiring artist. Still he just came of as annoying and lousy to have around most of the time. 
 
All be it a fantastic show you could argue that at points it can be slow or feel like not much is happening. Its not that i felt this to much but i can see where it might drag at a few points. I understand what Barakamon is about so i never had a pacing issue myself. 
 
The dub was very enjoyable for those who prefer it that way. Robert McCollum, (the boi) who is probably most notable as Kougami from the Psycho-pass series, uses his smooth man voice to deliver a fantastic performance for our hero. Giving the lead a voice that commands a little respect made him a much more enjoyable character than if he had the voice of a typical light novel boy voice, and for the use of Robert McCollum i give the dubbing team a tip of the hat. 
 
Naru may be one of the cutest characters in anime that I've ever come across, and in the best ways i find her to be a great representation of the child in not only Sei, but in whomever is watching the show as well. Naru was never used for anything thing other than feeling like a realistic 7 year old girl, and for that i am very grateful. It hurts my heart sometimes to see innocent characters used for some creeps fansevice shitfuck purposes.  
 
All in all i can't think of a bad time to be had watching this show. Even if its not your genre of choice you would still probably enjoy this. The art and characters are beautiful coupled with a nice story on learning to mature and grow as a person it will make you feel good all the way baby. 
 
Final thoughts: I didn't mention the Calligraphy for some reason. It's like important but in the same respect it could be swapped out with a different passion and work just as well. Great fresh idea though, and that's the shit i like to see.

    I've seen worse. Of all the food-themed animes I've seen, this is definitely not the worst. 
 
I like these little animes, especially food-themed ones. It's true the art is cheap, but cute enough for me. Three and a half minute episodes are fine, especially when it doesn't have that long theme song unlike some other short animes. It has the best kind of cast: all-girl joshikousei. 
 
So. This one is half a slice of life, half about cooking. And the cooking is ... well, you'll see. Considering this is Japan, maybe it's even based on reality. I'm actually tempted to write down the recipes.

    I was very skeptical about watching Nyan Koi. I have a weakness for romances and that is what pulled me into watching it. I thought it would be jam packed with cute talking cats and I would give up on the first episode.  
 
Well I didn't. I enjoyed it all the way through. It's a very funny anime and I always anticipated the next episode. The main characters are all hilarious. You have the cute girl everyone loves, the tsunderes, and the idiot boy who doesn't have a clue anyone likes him. Yet, they all still seem refreshing in their own way.  
 
You'll fall in love with the characters and their humor, as well as the cute little cats Junpei meets along his cursed endeavor.

    Oh man am I a sucker for shows that have prior leads returning in roles where they no longer have to fit into the straightforward protagonist/antagonist story arc and instead are free to have more interesting development. And Zeta certainly fulfills this promise, using a handful of characters from the granddaddy in (mostly) new and interesting roles that don’t overshadow the main narrative, although I would be lying if I didn’t wish we got a little more of Amaro and bad boy Kai. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the new cast who are almost entirely irrational to an unrelatable degree and without any interesting consistent growth or arcs. The show also suffers from being stretched way too long, and lacking the quirky variety of its predecessor ends up becoming incredibly repetitive. For instance, there is an arc focusing on a sympathetic enemy’s death which is followed by the same enemy appearing alive without explanation, only to die again in the same ‘tragic’ way, before the arc repeats itself a few more times for good measure with increasingly less compelling copy cat characters. Probably the most interesting aspect of the show is the unique mostly earth orbit space faring sci fi setting Zeta inherits and expands on from its predecessor, but i'd still like to see more done with it. The series’s mech design sense also has to be noted, which is certainly unique for the Gundam franchise and produces a few gems, but also largely doesn’t seem to fit into the overall franchises design sense while also not being as absurdly unique as turn A.  
 
Iconic mech designs: 3.5/10 (Zeta, Hyaku Shiki, mk ii, marasai?) 
Kai: 2/10 (+1 for being Indiana Jones, but why must Tomino tease us with greatness?)

Char trustworthiness (according to him): 10/10 (“I’ve never betrayed anyone in my entire life!”) 
Female characters not motivated mainly by dat man meat: 2/9 (Emma, Haman) 
Sunglasses effectiveness at hiding identity: 3/10 (it worked for Superman)  
Psychedelics: 7/10 (psychic energy drain…?) 
Unintentional memes: 7/10 (“I came here to laugh at you”)

    This film was recommended by so many people when I first started getting into anime about a year ago, and I can see why. This short film has an incredibly simple story but it is told so well, and shifts from heartwarming to heart-wrenching seamlessly. I'm glad that this film realized that it didn't need 90+ minutes to tell its story; if it was a full-length film everything would seem forced and too stretched out, but being about 45 minutes was the perfect length. The only downside I saw in this movie was the soundtrack, whereas the writing was great, the music seemed...bad (except for the ED) and out of place. It wasn't that the music was bad, it just seemed to be going for a more atmospheric style that didn't really work. All in all a solid film, especially for those new to anime, just be ready to have a box of kleenex ready for the end.

    Review: 
 
Personal Opinions 
This anime was quite hilarious. I became interested on the topic of chuunibyou (aka Eighth Grader Syndrome) after I watched Steins;Gate, and combined with my curiosity on the eye-patch girl who appears quite often on the internet, it led me to watch this anime. I must say that this is one of the better slice-of-life anime I have watched, and as I write this I am watching the sequel. I was planning to write a single review for both of them...but I ended up deciding against that. 
Also, during some of the sadder/slower/romantic parts of the anime I usually felt a bit bored, and I think I'll go into more detail in the review. 
 
Story: 6/10 
The story was pretty interesting, although I enjoyed the first half more than the second half, for various reasons. The second half was slower paced, felt melancholy, had a heavy focus on romance between characters, and I found it lacking in the earlier comedy. The romance wasn't bad....but (in my opinion) it wasn't that great either. But more on that in the 'characters' section. 
Like lots of slice of life anime, the anime was mostly episodic, while the story's main plot progressed in the background. The last few episodes were when things started to get a bit more into the genre of drama and some heartstrings were being pulled. Now...the last few episodes weren't bad, but, like the romance, not as good as I hoped. I think I was supposed to feel emotional or something, but I only really thought two things: ""You kids are making a biiiiig mistake here!"" and ""I'm kinda bored"". The second half wasn't that bad - I just didn't like it as much as the first half, and I felt the drama was rather sudden, though story-wise it made sense. The problem was that all of the comedy that I absolutely loved about the series kind of died out after the drama hit, and that was something that, I as the viewer, was not ready for. I felt that this was something that hurt the series, and that it was a bit unnecessary. The story ended on a satisfactory note though, so you don't need to worry about that. 
So basically, the story was great in comedy and made me laugh a lot, the romance felt a bit awkward to me, and the last few episodes I was feeling rather frustrated at the characters and what they were doing, but it ended quite nicely. 
 
Characters: 7/10 
For the most part the characters were pretty good. I thought the main character, Togashi, was a bit lame honestly, but whenever we got to see his chuunibyou side it was really cool. The female lead, Rikka, was also a bit boring without her chuunibyou personality, but I think it made sense. 
The romance....I felt like they didn't have enough synergy for it to be interesting, and I think their relationship is kind of relationship that siblings would have (excluding the blushing and pinky-holding). The fact that Rikka both looks and acts younger than Togashi doesn't help much either. 
My favourite character was probably the 'Dark Flame Master', but sadly he had a exceedingly short amount of screen time. ): 
 
Art: 8/10 
Love, Chuunibyou and Other Delusions offers some pretty nice art for the most part. Of course, money-saving tactics are present, but there have been a few interesting scenes where someone in the background is moving around in which otherwise would've been a still picture. I thought that made it a bit more interesting, and it shows that they didn't just drop a still picture scene in the middle of the anime. 
Something on the more shocking side of things, the battle animation actually looks really cool. Yes, BATTLE ANIMATION. IN A SLICE OF LIFE ANIME. 
Perhaps my only complaint is that the characters were all drawn to look so young. I couldn't take the romance seriously because their faces are soo child-like! 
 
Sound: 8/10 
No complaints here, but nothing particularly caught my attention. The OP and ED were pretty nice, and fit the anime pretty well. Same with the soundtracks. 
I really liked the voice actor for 'Dark Flame Master'. It was really cool. 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Final Notes: 
It was a pretty nice anime, and I would say that it was worth my time, just because of the chuunibyou. I really like chuunibyou stuff now after watching Steins;Gate and this anime....If only I had the guts to scream ""BANISHMENT, THIS WORLD"" for my whole school to hear!

    I love, Bakuman! I picked this series up on a whim one morning at a book store. Was looking for something fresh, and fresh I got indeed. Now, you might not think Bakuman, a story that resolves around 2 kids who wan't to make it big in the manga world is exciting, but, the Author of this series adds so many cool characters, twist, and special events that it's not hard to fall in love with the series.  
 
Now on to the anime adaption, I loved the first 2 adaptions of this series. They did it very well, with out cutting stuff out to help there show. Now, when Bakuman season 3 came out, I was excited to see the stuff that's been going on in the Manga (I pick them up monthly with the speed up Viz is doing). So far the show is doing good, but out of nowhere there starting to cut out ALLLLLLOOOOT of crap from the manga. Now I know some of the stuff isn't useful but to go from the START of Bakuman Volume 13 to almost the END of Volume 13 in just one episode? No, that was not cool at all.  
 
Besides that the anime adaption is doing good with the music just hope they start slowing down the pacing when it comes to volume 14-16

    Saekano is s story about an otaku who is trying to make his dream of creating a dating sim come true. Throughout the show he builds of members of his circle in order to create the ultimate dating sim. 
 
The story is okay, it isn't anything to write home about, but it sets the stage for the humor and the girl wars. 
7/10 
 
The show itself is very beautiful and well animated. 
9/10 
 
The music in the show is also really good and the voice acting is well done. 
8/10 
 
The characters are were the show shines.  
     The main character Tomoya is an otaku who loves to help others and make their dounjin shine. Once he finally gets his own chance to make his dream come true he goes all out in order to make it come true. 
    Kato is the character that Tomoya is training to make into the heroine for his game. She is mostly emotionless and is mostly a boring person from the beginning, but as the show goes on she becomes more outgoing and is just absolutely hilarious. 
   Eriri is the artist of the group and is Tomoya's childhood friend. She starts off being just a ordinary tsundere but has quite a bit of development in her own episode.  
   Utaha is the writer for the story. She breaks the 4th wall and fights with Eriri over who is better for Tomoya. 
   Michiru is introduced way too late into the show to really judge. I will say that her character is very lewd. 
9/10 
 
I loved this show and I am sad to see it end. I laughed every single week and it has easily become one of my favorite shows. The show makes fun of tropes, other shows, and even itself sometimes. It has some fanservice moments thrown in, but there it really isn't that bad except in episode 0. Sometimes it is even used as a humor element itself. 
10/10 
 
Overall I give the show a 9/10. It is absolutely hilarious and a must watch in my opinion.

    “You are an idiot!  Did you see what this idiot just did?!” — Phil Hellmuth 
 
Nothing will ever come close to the hilarity of a Phil Hellmuth tirade, but watching several hawt women gamble their clothes away….wait, they’re not playing strip poker?…Mother F—ker!!!  Eh, I’m here anyway, might as well finish the review. 
 
Kakegurui×× — get your cocks ready for the ××× version, ya f—king compulsive dick touchers — is a show about compulsive gamblers who gamble compulsively in a moderately compulsive manner.  By employing unique games (gambles, if you will) in each episode, it forces the viewer to engage the strategic portion of their brain to imagine how they would handle the intense pressure of “betting it all.”  Except betting it all is not constrained to simple matters of transferring wealth from one individual to the next (or plunging ever deeper into debt), but willingly participating in games that coerce the loser to submit themselves to a form of finite slavery.  Now, with a cast of female-centered characters, who become aroused by the mere thought of placing a colossal bet, it would lead one to think that this slavery punishment would naturally proceed to situations of bondage (BDSM).  Of course, if this thought crossed your mind (like it did mine), then you must be one sick f—k, and I hope you wash your filthy eyes with a bar of soap until it stings similar to your butthole after eating $20 worth of Taco Bell. 
 
Speaking of which… 
 
Yuriko frequently has the look of someone who is squeezing their butt cheeks together to obstruct the ass-quake that is the Taco Bell bean burrito.  Her extreme facial expressions, along with the exorbitant emotions of the other characters, is a comedy in and of itself.  Can it be a bit excessive at times?  Perhaps.  Although, that all depends on your specific anime predilections.  Elitists will naturally flock away from such eccentricities, while the “everything is good” crowd may find the tantalizing scenes to be quite entertaining.  Kakegurui×× is not the type of anime that will confound you with its narrative brilliance or “advanced” betting strategies, as most of the tactics involve a healthy dose of chicanery; nevertheless, it is “watchable” for its creativity in generating new games and seeing how the capricious contestants navigate themselves towards the path of victory. 
 
That being said, Yumeko’s numerous battle’s become rather redundant, with a familiar theme playing out in each match, that being: the new rival is convinced of their victory, because of a deceptive advantage; however, when Yumeko neutralizes the edge with her deus ex machina (whatever skill the writer’s deem necessary to have her overcome the next hurdle), the opponent quickly loses their overall decorum, becoming a pathetic mess of a person because of their defeat.  But if you can disregard this overt predictability, then you may find yourself thoroughly delighted with the exciting gambling, hilarious facial expressions, and novel gameplay. 
 
Being that Kakegurui×× is a gambling show, it’s only fitting to give it a score of 5/10 (i.e. 50%) — which are the desired odds for anyone looking for a rush!

    Mini Yuri does as expected. Hyping up the Yuru Yuri 10th Anniversary ""Yuru Yuri Ten"" Project. It does it well. If you like the Yuru Yuri show in general, you'll love this. The usual comedy is there, and the usual fun and interesting characters are there too. So you'll love it too! It's short and sweet, but still provides good laughs. 
 
You can watch all four mini episodes within one entire episode. It's a great watch if you want something short and sweet to watch for a bit. Really gets you hyped up for the upcoming Yuru Yuri ten in general.

    Death Parade in a word: Eerie 
 
The color scheme in the animation was spot on for the story and the characters. I thought the anime overall had a lot of little clever things throughout: the elevators, the games, the pool table, etc. Whoever thought all those out has quite the imagination! 
 
It was very violent in the first few episodes, but the violence kind of mellowed out as the show went on, which kind of disappointed me a little bit because that's basically why I was watching it: The pretty animation and the violence. 
 
I like the relationship between the leads Decim and Kurokami no Onna. I wish it had gone on longer than just 12 episodes because I felt like their relationship could have grown more. In fact, I think the whole show probably should have had at least 24 episodes. The Death Parade world is big enough and creative enough to have gone on way past just 12 episodes. (I haven't read the manga so IDK how deep the Death Parade world actually is). So it would be nice to have another season. 
 
I'm giving it an 8 overall because I think it should have been longer and because it didn't end well. The ending was okay, but I think they could have done much better.

    Mary to Majo no Hana is based on a children's story by British author Mary Stewart. The anime film was Studio Ponoc's premiere work. Basically, they're a group of creators who splintered off of Studio Ghibli, probably because they were mortified by Tales from Earthsea and the only way to distance themselves from it entirely was to start their own studio. With black jack and hookers. Let's see how much of a splash they made. 
 
Story: 
 
We open with a building on fire and a hooded girl scarpering while magical beasts try to chase after her. We then cut to a young girl, Mary, suffering from boredom since her great aunt's house has no games and a broken television. I mean, she has books so maybe read?  I know when I was a kid I'd do that literally all day on occasion until my mum caught me and made me go outside because she thought bug bites built character or some such shite. One day she's eating lunch outside when she encounters a pair of cats. She follows them into the woods and down the dell, the path is strange but they know it well. There in the woods she finds a strange flower and thus begins the journey. Basically, it gives her magical abilities and she finds herself in a strange land where there's a magic school. Unfortunately for her, this magic school hides a dark secret. 
 
And no, it isn't copying Harry Potter because there's a magic school. The book this is based off of came out way before Harry Potter. Just like the majority of things that get accused of copying Harry Potter for some reason. Seriously, I've seen the late Sir Terry Pratchett accused of ""ripping off"" those books because of Ponder Stibbons, a character who was introduced in 1990. Seven years before those books existed.  
 
The biggest flaw with the story telling in this film lies in the pacing. There are some long, dragged out moments that are mainly intended to build atmosphere but they just go on too long. And, to exacerbate the problem, there are some really important moments that get really glossed over. And the big example of that lies in the big ""important"" friendship betwixt Mary and Peter. They barely exchange a few sentences and go from not particularly caring for one another to besties for no apparent reason. The film is also a bit inconsistent with things like how long the effects of the flower actually last.  
 
That being said, pretty much everything to do with the magic school is really good. The animal scenes in particular are fantastic. The film also excels at building up its big twists enough so that they make perfect sense and you can kind of see them coming but not to an extent where they're really obvious or come across as contrived. And the atmospheric scenes may drag at times, but they are pretty effective, especially when they actually do end at sensible points. 
 
Characters: 
 
This varies a bit. Mary is a compelling character and her complex about her hair does add some depth to her and is just very relatable. Her great aunt is also quite interesting, particularly when the film goes into her history. I also like that there's effort put into humanising the antagonists, in spite of all the really not okay things they do. In contrast, Peter is just a generic good lad and the other side characters are just ""the gardener"" or ""housekeeper."" And you don't really expect the side characters to be super interesting given that the film has to do other things but Peter is a major character. He should not be dull as tepid dishwater. He is, but he shouldn't be.  
 
Art: 
 
You can tell that this was made by former Ghibli staff. It looks gorgeous. The backgrounds are really well detailed. The magic school has a sense of whimsy and wonder about it along with some phenomenal visuals. The designs are interesting. The action flows really well. It's just a very nice film to look at.  
 
Sound:  
 
Young Sugisaki Hana does a great job in the lead role, in spite of having very few voice acting roles. Ootake Shinobu is also very good. As is Satou Jirou. And none of them have a lot of voice roles. Muramatsu Takatsugu's soundtrack is pretty good as well.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
It's based off a children's book from the 70s. It has exactly as much as you would think, bugger all.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Mary to Majo no Hana may not be the best film out there, but it is pretty damn solid. It has a good degree of charm, adventure and whimsy. Its biggest problems are Peter, some contrived character dynamics and some unexplained inconsistencies. None of which are all that bad everything considered. I'll give it a 7/10. It's a good film. Tomorrow, Xiao Qian.

    This slice of life anime is like no other slice of life anime.  
 
If you like absurdist humor, playful use of changing art styles, heartwarming moments, and many WTF moments, Nichijou is your anime. The art style is fluid and adorable; the characters are endearing. There's really a whole lot to love about this anime. 
 
There's no real way to explain Nichijou without spoilers, so instead I will just say that at one point the president of the school wrestles a deer; there's a fight involving a goat; another fight involving chopsticks; and many more strange scenes besides. Absolutely give this anime a watch.

    One of the most relatable, keenly-observed, and emotionally realistic depictions in anime of a boy's coming of age is also a story about how a space pirate who steals star systems is set free from interdimensional jail to stop giant irons from flattening the creases in planet Earth. This is not a contradiction. 
 
FLCL is a lot of things. It's hilarious, running the gamut of humour from the opening slapstick of Haruko ramming into Naota with her moped, to the chaotic character-based humour of normal people trapped in absurd situations (Naota) and abnormally perverted people (Naota's dad and granddad) lapsing into gibberish as their overheated brains process the idea of an affair between Naota and and the lovely young woman who's invaded their house, to the constant surreal innuendo of Naota's repressed sexual impulses manifesting as phallic horns from his forehead. FLCL's refusal to conform to either reality or a consistent style allows it to turn into manga, South Park, and a John Woo movie whenever it feels like ramping up the ridiculousness of any given premise.  
 
It's gorgeous, with some of the smoothest animation delivered by the medium before or since, offbeat but beautifully-drawn character designs, a wealth of sci-fi monsters and robots, and an unerring eye for the striking image - see Canti leaping onto the roof of the burned-out school and sending a spire of light into the air as the birds explode out of the building and fly up around him, or Naota silhouetted against the burning horizon, holding his guitar. The team puts in a hundred percent, enlivening the most standard scenes with a fresh approach: see a late-series scene where Naota's dad and grandad are interrogating him on his feelings about Haruko. It could have been drawn side-on from beginning to end, but the camera is an at extreme angle looking up from below them, to enhance how grotesque the perverted adults look as they tower over Naota and question him.  
 
Nobody slacked off on FLCL; while it has its share of semi-still frames with overdubbed conversation as people sit and talk, this isn't done out of laziness, but to emphasise the drowsy summer haze that hangs over the city of Mabase, turning everything golden and shimmering, so that - despite how ridiculous it is - you kind of get why Naota keeps saying ""Nothing amazing happens here. Only the ordinary"", even as giant robots keep coming out of his head.  
 
Despite how wacky FLCL is, it never loses the atmosphere that makes it feel so nostalgic and true to childhood summer memories, where the days seem to stretch out forever and you - much like Naota - can't wait to grow up, even as there's a sense of melancholy for the innocence you're leaving behind. Using the pillows for the soundtrack was an inspired choice. The songs complement it perfectly, from the threatening buzzsaw guitars of ""Stalker"" that underscore the sci-fi monsters to the brief moments of pure happiness that could scarcely be better echoed than by ""Beautiful morning with you"", or the plaintive strains of ""One Life"" under Naota's sobbing melancholy - and it all comes together with (maybe - who can really pick?) my personal favourite, ""Blues Drive Monster"", which makes the spectacular giant-robot climax even cooler than it was to begin with.  
 
It is, of course, thrilling. While the action is always on the cartoonish side, being more for the sake of entertainment and allegory than to actually ascertain ""who's stronger"", it's always brilliantly choreographed, fast-paced, and full of spectacular animation which magnifies the awe-inspiring sense of impact - see the aftermath, almost like a nuclear strike, of episode 4's climax, where Naota has to bat a falling satellite back into space before it levels the city.  
 
On the level of pure entertainment, it's perfect, an unadulterated sugar rush. But if it was no more than that, it would be notable but not a masterpiece. What elevates it is the way all of its special effects bombast is put in the service of developing character and exploring psychology - mostly Naota's, though it applies to Mamimi and Ninamori and even Haruko. 
 
FLCL can come off as pretty opaque when you try to figure it out, because it's really not like almost any other anime. Rather than using conventional methods of exploring a character's feelings and motivations, such as putting them in a pressure-cooker situation till they blurt out confessions of how they feel, or having them pour out their hearts to conveniently-placed friends/relatives/agony aunts who exist to enable emotional exposition, FLCL tends to keep it a lot more subtle (which is an odd thing to say about an anime where giant horns sprouting from a boy's forehead represent his lust, but, wait), and use a lot of symbols and metaphors to clue you in. 
 
(Unless you've seen FLCL, you'll be a little confused by this, and also spoiled on the plot, so read on with caution.) 
 
Here are a few loosely-connected symbols and concepts which, in the impressionistic dream-logic of FLCL, explain what Naota's all about: his brother, Tasuku, who plays baseball; 'Tasukete', which means 'help me' or 'save me'; baseball bats; guitars; wanting to be an adult; adults who don't grow up; Mamimi, Tasuku's girlfriend; Naota's perverted dad; Haruko; and the Oedipus complex. 
 
The first thing Naota says about Haruko is that she's ""a stupid adult that's not mature enough to grow up"". In episode three, he dismisses performing in a school play, because ""school plays are for kids""; ""You ARE a kid!"", Ninamori retorts. Naota's dad is a grotesquely immature man-child who barely even attempts to take care of him. In episode 6, Naota's teacher visits the house and asks if his dad is worried that Naota's been abducted by their housekeeper. His dad doesn't care. But there was an older presence in his life that Naota looked up to to: his brother, Tasuku, who is gone now, leaving him all alone. Tasuku played baseball. Naota carries around a baseball bat and glove because he wants to be like his brother, but when push comes to shove, he won't swing it. Mamimi misses Tasuku, so she plays around unseriously with Naota, hugging and cuddling him; he knows she's using him as a substitute for his brother, and he resents it, but he has a crush on her, so it's painful but it still makes him a little happy.  
 
Speaking of crushes, he has a major one on Haruko. Who does Haruko remind him of? When she swings the guitar into Canti in episode 1, he thinks to himself, shocked out of his affected adolescent detachment, that she looked like his brother - the only person he seems to respect and miss. What does Haruko do? She tries to make him swing the bat. Just carrying it around because it reminds him of Tasuku, wanting to be Tasuku, but being too afraid to swing the bat, is to be a child. Naota won't swing the bat. He's living in the amber haze of Mabase, trapped in childhood, desperately wanting to grow up, too scared of embarrassment and love and risk to do anything except sullenly tolerate Mamimi's caresses, run away from Ninamori's play, distance himself from Haruko, and refuse to swing the bat. 
 
But Haruko said it. ""Nothing can happen until you swing the bat.""  
 
Naota swings the bat - or at least, the guitar (which is rock and roll; it's even cooler than baseball; it's a penis; it's his self-worth; it's a whole bunch of things in one symbol) - and saves his town. In episode 2, he gets into trouble with the robots and says ""Tasuk..."" and you can't tell if he's saying ""tasukete"" (""save me"") or calling for his brother. A symbol lights up Canti's face. It's a corrupted version of the Japanese symbol for - you guessed it, ""Adult"". But Tasuku's gone and Naota - just Takkun to Mamimi, who uses him as a substitute for his brother but treats him like a kid, and rejects him when he tries to ask her on a date - needs to be the adult himself.  
 
So he grows up. ""Never call me Takkun again. My name is Naota"", he tells her (though only after being rejected makes the most explosive robot-penis yet come out of his head and turn into a city-destroying nightmare; because being rejected by your crush is the worst thing that can happen to you when you're a kid). Naota blatantly crushed on Haruko the whole time, but he'd just get embarrassed and mad about it when she teased him, or pretend not to care. When she turns up after going missing in episode 6, he cries for the first time, hugging her, asking where she went. Part of growing up is being honest with yourself.  
 
Did I mention the Oedipus complex? Strictly speaking, Naota's mom isn't around (and he's even lonelier for it, poor kid), but the stand-in here is Haruko, who both Naota and his dad are obviously into. Naota resents it when Haruko gets close to his dad. Things come to a head in episode 5 when it looks like they're having sex at one point. His dad taunts Naota about it. Naota's holding a baseball bat - the symbol of Tasuku, adulthood, masculine power, and an extension of his dick (and its frustrated desires) all in one. What does he do? He smashes a TV (representing Canti, who has a TV for a head, gets kissed by Mamimi at one point - which Naota doesn't like - and is the portal for Atomsk, and thus Haruko's true goal the whole time), and a clock (representing time) flies off it and hits his dad in the head, killing him. So Naota kills his dad, the immature adult, with 1. a symbol of his penis and 2. a symbol of time over, 3. the girl they're sexually competing with each other for. 
 
Is FLCL crass and sex-obsessed? Sure, but so are 14 year-old boys. It's not all that subtle about its symbolism and its networks of meaning - Tasuku/Tasukete is hilariously blatant - but it doesn't need to be. The anime may seem like it was written by throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks, but it's a tight and coherent narrative of one kid growing up, expressed both through the haphazard and entertaining plot, and through the potent symbols that keep cropping up - baseball bats, guitars, adulthood, and young love.  
 
And while a lot of it goes on inside Naota's head, it's by no means solipsistic. Mamimi and Ninamori each get a whole episode full of their own symbolic (and literal) narratives, which colour them in and make them equally interesting characters. We find out that Mamimi is alone, bullied, and uncared-for even as we also find out she might be an arsonist, but it's all because she misses the one person she really cared about - Tasuku - who saved her from their burning elementary school. The sequence in which Naota realises this in a furious connecting-the-dots cascade is FLCL at its best - it might be a whole minute of nothing but furiously flashing images and symbols, connecting Mamimi's lighter and cigarettes to her Firestarter video game, to the arson, to the burned elementary school, to Tasuku, to Canti, to Cantido-sama, and back.  
 
Mamimi is very weird because she's very lonely, and avenging herself upon the town that doesn't give a shit about her using her new robot dog to eat everyone's cars isn't very satisfying even before it turns into a giant monster. Note that she calls her new pet Naota, replacing the old Takkun, whom she always treated like a pet in the first place. Mamimi's development is about making peace with Naota, not treating people selfishly because you want something from them, and embracing her own talents - as a photographer. 
 
Ninamori doesn't get quite as neat an arc, but her little story of adolescent embarrassment and anger at her cheating dad and fear of a divorce, as well as her resentment of the secretary her dad has been cheating with, combine poignantly with her need to perform the story of the Marquis of Carabas so her parents can come watch and be happy. Revealingly, it's a story about a lie that becomes the truth - a cat, Puss in Boots, makes its owner into a nobleman by successfully pretending to be one before they switch places. And she wants Naota to play the cat; she wants him to be the one to save her.  
 
Eventually, it works out for Ninamori's family situation. and she gets a moment in the sixth episode which beautifully illustrates FLCL's ability to depict complex, contradictory emotions. She finds Haruko and Naota asleep, together, on a bench in the street, covered by a sleeping bag and some cardboard. The older women who command Naota's affection have always inspired Ninamori's resentment, but here, she's no longer really angry or jealous. Her face reflects a complicated mixture of pity and disappointment, before she walks away, letting them be at peace. 
 
Haruko's development is of the blink-and-you'll-miss-it nature, because we don't really understand her. Her enigmatic nature, by turns teasingly flirtatious and menacingly scary, is how a boy like Naota might see an intimidating older woman, only dialed up to 11 like everything else in FLCL. But it comes out like this: although she seems to have a certain fondness for Naota, everything Haruko does for him - mainly forcing him to grow up by making him swing the bat - is for her own selfish purposes, to develop his N.O. channel till it can summon Atomsk, whose power she wants to steal.  
 
When Naota climbs out of Canti, claiming the power of Atomsk for himself and asserting his own individuality as a young man, she reveals the ferocious greed that's always been hidden by her whimsical facade, and attacks him - he could kill her, but he doesn't. He kisses her, and admits he's in love with her. And while it doesn't work out, and she does leave, she finally acknowledges that he's not just someone she can exploit and hurt for her own ends and drag around throughout space. He's still a kid. There's a fondness to her final farewell which suggests Naota managed to melt her cold heart a little. 
 
That's FLCL; a phantasmagorical lightshow of fighting giant robots and ridiculous sexual innuendo hiding complex characterisation, strong development, some of the most credit-worthy use of ""show, don't tell"" as a narrative strategy, and a weirdly wonderful evocation of childhood. It's an anime that uses the near-infinite flexibility of the medium as it should be used, to tell a story in a way that nothing but an anime could.

    No one does action better than Studio Trigger! 
 
TL;DR: Watch, if you love turn-your-brain-off action and stunning visuals, accompanied with an exhilarating soundtrack and a positive message. If plot is a key point for you, you may be a little underwhelmed.  
 
Story: 7/10 
Without giving anything away, the premise and plot progression were redundant. They reminded me of many of Studio Trigger's most prominent works of the past. Is this a bad thing? Absolutely not, in my opinion. However, is it groundbreaking? No. This said, I welcomed the redundancy. The movie was filled with references to the aforementioned successes of Studio Trigger, which I appreciated as a fan of series like Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill. Oh, there were some Darling in the FRANXX references, too, but I don't feel like dwelling on that. 
 
Art: 9/10 
Continuing on the last point, the art is redundant. I say that in the most positive way possible. The action scenes certainly meet the standard set by the fantastic Trigger action series of the past. In addition, the use of color was strikingly unique, I haven't seen anything use color quite like Promare did. However, I noticed the use of a bit more CG animation than usual, which was still good, but was noticeable enough to break my immersion a few times. I must reiterate here, the CG was good. Nothing like Overlord, Berserk, or any other CG horror stories. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
The soundtrack is yet another staple in Trigger projects, and one of the reasons they tend to be so memorable. While I can't say it is quite as memorable as shows of the past (and maybe that's nostalgia talking,) the score fit the tone of the movie and each scene quite well. It was everything I could have wanted. 
 
Character: 6/10 
Probably the weakest aspect of this movie in my opinion, they seem like actual rehashed versions of protagonists from their past works. Frankly, the three protagonists seem like Gurren Lagann wannabees. They were still quite likable, but not memorable in their own rights, in my opinion.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
This made a fantastic night out. Watching this made time melt away, and I was enthralled from the intro to the end credits. Definitely a fun way to spend your night.

    *Virgin reviewer so be gentle* 
 
People will always ask other people what to watch, recommend me something, im so bored what should i watch. People will also say is there ever going to be another masterpiece like Brotherhood or when is something going to become as popular as Death note. What will have the sheer guts to move me to the next episode, to make me want to watch and not go to sleep. WHAT anime is going to be the next big thing and blow my mind for days, weeks, months and even years. well its two simple words and for people to know that these two simple words mean nothing but everthing, Steins;Gate. 
 
This Will be a classic anime in the years to come, people will still talk about great anime's like Death Note, Brotherhood, Code Geass and Suzumiya Haruhi, however they will be talking about Steins;Gate as well. 
 
Story: 10 
 
IF you watch 3 episodes of this you will not need a time machine to see how good this can be, will be, and is. The story revolves around Okabe Rintarou or the Mad Scientist. One day after seeing a certain predicament, he finds himself in a loop. The cause, a make shift time machine that will send his texts back in time. He then finds out the first message has altered the future in a big way. After that he then helps his fellow friends by making there dreams come true. The only problem is he will now have to skip between time lines to make everything right. He then finds out he is blessed with a certain power that helps him between jumps and after jumps through time. This stories base is certainly not that original, a time machine has been done in tv, anime's, movies and so on. The difference lady/gentle otakus, the execution of the story mixed with comedy and all together random moments. It has a serious plot line with comical sub plots that eventually tie the story in a nice little ball for all people to see. 
 
Art: 9 
 
This might just be me being biased but the art was great. It fit with the character designs and semi futuristic vibe towards the end and everything in between. Im not trying to say its spectacular or you need to watch this anime just for the Art, It simply fits with the overall masterpiece that is Steins;Gate. The Art goes from a little bubbly at times that fits with the nonchalant help my lab members to dark and twisted, with half trippy vibes you get from the time machine factor. 
 
Sound: 9 
 
Im at a loss on what to say here, the sound just works. But out of all honesty you will be to focused on what is going on to even realize the shrills and bravado that is going on. I gave this a 9 based on the fact it works with the moods, character development and overall enjoyment of the show. Also because there was never a time when the music pissed me off and distracted me from watching which is hard to do in most anime's, the sound is either to loud, noisy, or just doesn't fit the bill with some bubble gum pop rock garbage. when you watch you will understand what im trying to convey. 
 
Characters: 10 
 
It just has to be, it just does. i wont even say 1 episode it will only take FIVE MINUTES for you to realize this is a crazy cast of different types of characters all meshed into a group almost like how Durarara!! was. Lets start the Bar with Okabe, the main character. He is over the top shatter the mold ""mad scientist"", Feelings of ups and downs insanely crazy and moronic to insanely brilliant and sharp. solving different parts to the puzzle, piecing the facts together, live and death struggle and impossible choices that are choose impossibly well. CHRISTINA!!!! or Kurisu Makise. The zombie, and perverted genius girl celebrity. 17 years old and a genius. (she also looks good in a lab coat MUAHAHAHA) she is with out a doubt a huge piece of the puzzle she is the Glue to this anime. She is first seen in the first episode in a sort of ""bad"" situation. she makes this story possible. Next Do Do Do DO Mayuri. I said Kurisu was the glue... i might have to take that back, when the story starts out you seen her for who she is and when its finished its the same good hearted girl that you will come to love. Every time she was on the screen i could not look away, she fascinated me from start to finish with her bright personality and sometimes to nice of a person, she is one of the better better female characters in my mind and the sad thing is she is not the best girl in this anime as you will see. Lets review the previous characters and characters i haven't mentions in bulk shall we. mad scientist that is crazy, lazy, good for nothing, sane, brilliant good for the world type of guy. 17 year old genius tsunedere with alot to prove nothing to gain, then nothing to prove everything to gain, gain and loss type. bubbly cute, happily funny, adorable and nice Mayuri. a Fat NEET Otaku suuupppa hacka with a maid complex. A most of the time cross dressing man, some times not so gross dressing women/man who is a shrine maiden with a hard crush and sometimes Broken heart. Moe cosplay maid fancy rich girl who has nothing while at the same time has everything but would rather have one thing than everything. future girl who sometimes knows everything, looking for her father when he is under her nose. A average store owner who is not so average nice but hard on rent then mean and murderous. Ok take all that into consideration and try to put those characters in any other anime and make it work.... you tired and failed why, because it can not be done. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
come on if you actually read this review thus far you would have a very good idea to why this was so enjoyable, and if you made it this far here *Gold Star* 
 
Overall: 10 
 
Child Please! twist's and turns, abnormally fantastic character development, surprisingly simply and complex at the same time. At the end you will be thinking about what was said for weeks to come, it has been months since i have watched this and i remember it so very clearly. That is the sign of a great anime. 
 
Final thought... 
 
WATCH! or else there wont be any time machines in the future! and we all want time machines, this deserves its score, its not some hyper inflated anime that has been made up from hype. watch, listen, read, learn..... you must do it John Titor said so.

    WHAT CAN ASK FOR MORE? Perfect 10/10 
 
An anime given all the characteristics its needs in order to make its audience ecstatic and hungry for more. From the start to finish of this season it followed completely its original story from manga, which didn't upset or left no vacant space for complaining. When someone appreciates hard work, there is no room for critic. Let's review Kimetsu No Yaiba kn details: 
 
Storyline: Score 10/10 
 
Demon slayer the name with the story can never be more appropriate. It does what its says. The characters build the story step by step with extraordinary excellence leaving its viewers dumbstruck. Every episode goes perfectly developing its plotlines with exciting end, lets all crave for next.  
 
Characters: Score 10/10 
 
The characters are finest in their own qualities. As people are different in character, this anime also illustrates its vast diversity excellently. The characters did hard work to develop themselves, has fear and imperfections, through courage and great training they step forward to counter the demons. Also demons has back story to cover their indentity. The character traits gives the audience inspiration to push past their own limitations. What an excellent representation! 
 
Animation: Score 10/10 
 
Unquestionably the animation is a major breakthrough in the anime industry to this date. Nothing like this animation has ever gotten aired. An amazing detailing of all frames displays uniqueness. 
 
There is no ending to its positive aspects which don't deserve an excellent credit.  
 
 
Thanks to all the people who gave their hard work and bring out wonderful creative masterpiece Kimetsu No Yaiba.

    I am still quite new to anime in the sense I've watched more mainstream types, however, FMA:B is one of the best anime I have come across. I think what really sells the story is the rich character development as well as motive. When you look at different types of shounen, it's all reaching for the top. I do like those kinds of animes, however, it gives a different and warm feeling when watching this show. The family bond is one of the most important driving forces in this anime which the creators keep consistent. The only mark that was lacking was the art/animation style since with the anime now lacks compared to most. (demon slayer lol) But, at the time of release (2009), this was one of the greatest. Sound is great, love the music. Love all the characters. Not as tear-jerky, but I do consider it pretty emotional. Any new anime watchers NEED to see this masterpiece. Probably one of the only 10s I consider giving out.

    Okay, I may not do very in depth reviews such as listing voice actors and writers and artists and do all these in depth ""underlying theme"" reviews. I hash it out cut and dry and emotionally so deal with it. 
 
Character: Rikuo Nura. Hes a kid. Normal human during the day, badass yokai leader at night. Hes got that white knight complex a little in both, but hes all honest and innocent during the day and a cool smooth-talking badass with a bit of an ego at night. All in all I love the two drastic sides of him and he isnt a pussy when hes in human form either. I love the character. Though theres an age difference between human form and yokai form that is a little odd. 
 
Story: I love the story. Having a story where the main character is friends with a ton of demons and yokai is pretty damn cool. And not that common. Loved it. And he fights a ton of other yokai throughout the story. He gets stronger with each fight, mostly in season 2. Taking over for his grandfather, current supreme commander of the nura clan. I like it. So the story is all about him taking his place at head of the family and growing up. Sounds emotional. It is. But also badass. 
 
Anyway, I recommend this anime to everyone who loves action and edo style japan themes. Even though its modern setting it has a lot of that edo style in it. Yokai living hundreds of years and all that. I cant believe this isnt more popular. I put it up next to Rurouni Kenshin.

    I've seen quite a few Chinese anime and this is by far one of the best ones. I must say it's pretty underrated. I haven't read the manhua so i dunno if there's any adaptation issues. Oh, and it's definitely not a horror anime because it wasn't in the least bit scary. I'd say more of Action, Adventure, Mystery, Comedy. 
 
I recommend this anime to mystery lovers, and I don't mean Conan lovers xD this is a subtle mystery. It's a really short anime which you can finish in an hour and half, with all the episodes even on YouTube.  
 
Story (8/10) 
There are 10 episodes which cover 3 ""cases"", so as to say. The main character is a self proclaimed Jack-of-all-trades but he's mainly a teen detective working with the police. He has this weird idk-how-to-explain ability that triggers unrealistic detective skills that put Sherlock's intuition to shame. There's adultery and gang business involved all around so it gets a bit unreal and badly paced at times. The tragedy grated throughout cases makes every episode better than you'd expect; you won't see some things coming. This needs a season 2, because episode 10 started a new case and many strings are left untied. 
 
Art (5/10) 
Nothing striking, very generic, typical Chinese animation and character design. Background art feels dull and lazy at times. So don't hope for anything spectacular. The MC wears a Captain America shirt that's TOTALLY not noticeable :P 
 
Music (4/10) 
Can't really say much because Chinese music isn't really to my liking. The BGM during episodes is either non-existent or mediocre. Voice acting is average as well. Sometimes everything seems forced and lifeless but other times things get energetic. 
 
Character (7/10) 
Every character seems bland at first but as you go more into the series, with all their backstories and interactions, you may find yourself ignoring the trivial character aspects, and looking at it as a whole, no character is thaaaat bad. But there could've been a little more work on this. My favourite characters are the main character and his best friend; the rest of them are average and bland, I couldn't get to like any of them. I didn't like a single villain in the entire series; they all were heavily flawed in so many ways. 
 
Enjoyment (9/10) 
I lowered my standards when I saw it because I usually tend to dislike Chinese anime. Of course I saw it muted because I simply can't stand the language (I'm sowwie xD). This one surprisingly piqued my interest. Each episode's last minute gives a sense of suspense so there's your driving factor. There's even a good amount of comedy to balance out the tragedy, all interspersed here and there. While the whole series was riddled with plotholes and flaws, his anime was different from all the other Chinese anime to ever come out. I've seen quite a few but nothing as underrated and worthwhile as this one.  
 
Overall (7.5/10) 
It's definitely not one to take the cake or win anyone's favourites but it's worth a quick watch. I can't wait for season 2!

    I just needed to say that if you're going to watch this, the first few episodes may seem pretty boring, but I need to tell you that it gets better. I was tempted to ditch it and move on to the next thing, but that was when it got interesting. 
Also, if you're facing problems with being a shut in like me, this might help, and for others it can even give you more of a will to live so I understand where the value is to others. 
Now in terms of the aspects outside of the story and characters, i'm not a good judge of because it doesn't always matter to me, but the inner voices of the characters can have somewhat of a different audio than in other anime, but it's not a big deal. hope this helped, enjoy!

    I was very impressed with this show! I wasn't really into anime when it came out, so i've been catching up on alot of good shows that came out in 2007, and i was very impressed with the animation of this one! The character models are all very attractive with slender bodies/faces. I also think the characters had a lot of life and connections. This stories more or less about tragic relationships, and people that strive too be together but ultimately can't have what they want out of a relationship. My only complaint was that i wish it was longer! I recommend this to anyone this has a little bit of everything in it

Anime That Tells About A Group That Works As A Waste Carrier With ""Debri"" 
 
Stories, art, sound, char Made very well 
Especially the Unexpected Story Section Where there is a woman who just entered a certain section in the Company. 
And as a junior in the company there is definitely a Senior who guides him and the senior is close to the new employee, gradually their closeness begins to enter into a new approach. 
And the art that is created is very good for the anime that was in the early 2000s 
 
For Anime enthusiasts with Space genre 
The anime is very suitable for the trial let alone the flow of Romance and drama in the anime It is very thick

    I remember watching a few episodes of this anime as a child an is probably the first harem romance anime I have ever watched. I found tenshi no shippo quite enjoyable and nostalgic. 
It is about a young man named Goro who is your typical kind harem protagonist. He is a loser who recently lost his job and quite unlucky but his luck starts to change when he meets three beautiful girls who turns out to be his guardian angels. We later find out the the girls are reincarnated versions of animals Goro helped or took care of in the past so they decide to repay his kindness by being his caring guardians. He then meets more guardian angels who live with him and serve him. Plot wise it is decent but it gets repetitive and boring. The art is fine for an old anime. Even though the plot and art was not as good as I wanted it to be I still enjoyed it because it's not like normal harem romcoms which focuses too much on echii or on typical characters but don't get me wrong I normally enjoy harem romcoms. Tenshi no shippo won't make you laugh out loud or drown you in echii fan service but will give you a light heart warming harem that will give you a pleasant change to your typical harems.

    Where do I begin with this dumpster fire? Well, I guess I should preface this with harems aren't exactly my cup of tea. They make little sense in the first place, but this show takes the stupidity to a whole new level. Oh yeah, spoilers.  
 
Story: 
This is an easy one. There isn't one. Touya dies and gets reincarnated in another world as the most OP protagonist in recent memory. He enslaves god after god, and has 5+ girls lusting after him. NOTHING HAPPENS. There's no character arcs. No real villain. No fucking nothing. This show is 12 episodes of a literal fantasy. I'm convinced that God and the other divine stuff in this show isn't really them, but parts of Touya's heaven as he wastes away there after he died.  
 
Characters: 
I'm not even going to distinguish characters by name because there is no point. The boy character, Touya, is a bland, personality-less, overpowered as all hell, and extremely unintelligent protagonist. That's it. Nothing about his old life comes back in any meaningful way. He's just extremely strong, and nice. The epitome of male fantasy. 
 
Then there are all the girl characters, who are all the goddamn same. They're all really weak in comparison to Touya, and they all are in love with him. The only difference is that they've got different voice actors and have different aesthetics. That that stuff away, and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between them. Absolutely no substance to these women whatsoever.  
 
 
Conclusion: 
Don't watch this. I honestly dropped it at around episode 3, but decided to catch up a few weeks later because I wanted to see if this show had decided to get its act together. It didn't.

    Were do I begin?  
 
Lets start with the story 
 
Pupa is about a sister (Yume) and a brother (Utsutsu) realtionship and I`m pretty sure just that made me take a step back. 
 But no I must always see the first episode befoure I dropp it. So I continued to watch. Simply because I love horror and that rule I have. When Yume walked home without her onii-chan (big brother) she saw an creepy lady with a big burnmark on her face who had an cat.  And after that she saw some red butterflies and then a hurt dog and after she asked if it was hurt (Yes I think she`s stupid) 
 
Well right after she asked that ALL the dogs inner organs came after her. Guts, eyeballs, blood everything came after her (good job doggie (^-^)) and after that onii-chan comes and his cute little sister turns into a monster and starts to eat everyone 
( What a beautiful story ) and onii-chan tries to talk to her and guess what she does.""SPOILER"" She kills and eats him (^-^) THE END 
 
What? That was not the ending? It continues (0-0)?""SPOILER"" Onii-chan is alive?WTF 
That was a great ending as it was. Why more? 
Well I give the story 3/10 
 
The animation is gray like and like a mist color stile but it was something I haven`t seen befoure so i give it 6/10 
 
sound ................. 4/10 
 
Characters............ I liked the dog. Yume= Onii-Chan! onii-chan! help me! Let me eat you!......(=-=)...seriusly. 
 Utsutsu (Onii-chan)= sister complex+perv 
everyone fears/hates Yume ( I don`t feel sorry for her) 
and the cat ladys name is Maria and is the only reason why (my reason) this is called an horror. 
 3/10 Thanks to the dog+Maria. 
 
My personal enjoyment 4/10  
its not so much of an horror to me 
 
Overall I give it 5/10 just because the dog+Maria and the fakt that Yume ate onii-chan 
 
see you (^-^)/

    I watched this on a whim several years ago, due to it becoming popular among my previous group of friends, and the appealing art style.  
Normally, I HATE anime that is moe fanservice-based and has no pretty males, but K-on may be one of the few exceptions to this. 
 
The reason? 
 
Well, the reason I hate such anime in the first place is because I am a feminist, so you can imagine that I hate seeing girls sexualized and used as nothing but pure fap-material(which many men do even for this seeminigly-innocent series). 
 
The reason I was able to tolerate and even enjoy this anime(enough that I would spend $200 on a Tsumugi doll), was because I felt they made the girls somewhat realistic and NOT degraded for moe anime standards. Surprisingly, they weren't sexualized, and they were adorable without being over-the-top annoying like most cutesy anime girls are. 
 
STORY: 
The story was like any typical daily-life anime I had seen before, except, I felt that it was very well-done for daily life anime standards. Something about how they paced it, or perhaps because of how they built up your excitement, it felt pretty good, despite how typical it is for a musical slice of life, when you stop to think about it.  
Actually, this anime is what encouraged me to go and finally get piano lessons! 
Really, the only thing I didn't like of the story was when Mio fell on the stage and accidentally revealed her underwear, as up-skirts are one of my least favorite things about ecchi, but it relieved me that they did not actually show it. 
Also, there is no real conflict at all besides deadlines, grades, and getting Yui to learn the guitar(which she learned quickly). I personally think it would have added to the story if the girls at least had some sort of relationship conflict with each other, and maybe resolved it later on? Maybe if they had a rival at least? 
 
ART: 
It's either the art/animation or the music that makes this anime exceed my expectations. I don't quite know how to explain it in one word, other than ""juicy"","" squishy"", or cute. I really quite love how they drew the characters' eyes and faces overall, and the movement in animation is really fluid, even little things like how their facial expressions change. They don't skim on their facial movements even when they're seen in chibi expressions. The art style for K-on is actually pretty unique, at least until some new anime series' with the same art-style came out afterwards. It will always be the ""K-on style"" to me, though. 
 
SOUND: 
Probably the best thing, along with the art/animation(possibly #1, though), is the music in this anime. Even to this day, years after the anime was at peak popularity, I still have some of their songs on my playlist. The music in this anime makes it a legit music anime that far exceeded my expectations that I had due to some of my friends saying ""only creepy otakus like K-on"". 
Although, I am not too fond of the super cutesy soft-sounding songs, I absolutely love the rock-type songs like ""Don't say Lazy"" and ""No thank you!!"", as they are so catchy, energetic, and uplifting without being annoyingly cute(the lyrics definitely are cute/happy). 
I should also add that Mio's strong voice in those two songs is quite empowering to hear in comparison to the soft pop songs. 
 
CHARACTER: 
As a person who generally hates cutesy anime girls... I felt that the characters were really charming. I would say that Yui and Mio were my favorite characters personality-wise, and Tsumugi my favorite design-wise(and because she plays the synth/piano). 
I can't say I was too fond of Azusa, but she is definitely cute design-wise. I love her eyes. Other than her design, though, I felt like she was too boring of a character besides the whole cat ears thing. 
One thing I particularly like about the character designs, is that they are not anorexic. They have realistic weights and heights typical of Japanese females in high school, and they get self-conscious about fat just like real girls(but not as annoyingly persistent). 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
This anime was pretty enjoyable for me. Normally, a non-comedy slice of life anime would have long periods of boringness, but this wasn't. It kept you excited through each episode, and something would always happen. 
Watching this kind of felt like I was becoming friends with them myself. You kind of feel like you're a part of their world, and growing with them as new friends. 
While watching this anime, this kept popping into my head: ""Are you sure this is made for guys? It's too innocent and girly and friendship-y... It feels more like a cute shoujo anime, only without boys/romance!"". 
 
Overall, it's a good anime that is definitely above average compared with other slice-of-life, and I would recommend it to anyone who has free time and wants to watch a light-hearted anime.

    Well well. After 3 months, here come the second part of the movie series. It's pretty much a great movie for me. As the title implies, it's more or less about teenagers must have their determination in life. Also, as you can see from the key visual, movie 2 centered within Mimi & Joe. So, let me go into detail one by one. This will be spoiler free review. 
 
Story - 6/10 
It's more or less goes with the same formula used in part 1 of the movie, which most of the time was just slice of life with nothing happened at all. However, these slice of life actually helps in rebuilding the characters and refresh the audience to know them again. So, slice of life is actually necessary. For the story, in this part, it's about Joe having determination and awareness of himself, same goes to Mimi. And well, the movie continued where part 1 stopped, with pretty much of plot twists. I am so sad again. 
 
Premise - 6/10 
Determination, angst, adolescence, awareness, teenage issues, all of these are the theme of the movie. This reminds me of 01 when Yamato was edgy of courage and during 02 when Ken was having a huge conflicts for being replacement. The premise for this part is pretty good. Everyone must have awareness of what they really want.  
 
Characters - 7/10 
Well presentation in delivering refreshment onto every single character in this sequel movie series. Everyone grows up, so does the characters in Digimon. They won't be the same as past (01 & 02), that's why character development is necessary. This part there are more character development for Mimi & Joe. At the same time, more details were given onto the other characters. At the same time, reintroduction of old casts is a well-done too. For now, the audience is able to on track with every single characters, as they know them well now. 
 
Animation - 8/10 
Best animation Toei could deliver. The battle scenes are amazing, with every single blow of movement well-drawn. Reminds me of how beautiful Kyousougiga is.  
 
Sound - 7/10 
Matched every single perfectly, especially for FEEL moments. Also, few insert tracks gave me nostalgia of the original. 
 
Enjoyment - 8/10 
It's freaking enjoyable. Watching your favourite female character (Mimi) grow up is a rare opportunity, as she is just a fictional character. Also, old casts return no doubt is a great thing for fans like me. At the same time, new girl MeiMei is so damn adorable! The slice of life absolutely wasn't for nothing. 1 hour 20 minutes of the movie are freaking worthy for the day! 
 
Overall - 7/10 
This part of the movie series is really great. Perhaps, it just for Digimon fans. However, it really great, compare with the first of the movie series. I am so anticipated for the third part of series now, as it freaking ended with a cliffhanger. Oh damn!

    It's a will they or won't they, just that one is a utter cold genius, the other is a lovable ditz. 
 
Itazura na Kiss follows Kotoko Aihara a ditzy girl who proclaimed her love to Naoki Irie, a genius student in his school through a love letter, through unforeseen circumstances that includes Kotoko's house being razed and Kotoko's father acquaintance, Kotoko has to live in the same roof as Naoki. Will Kotoko and Naoki, two diametric opposite personalities ever come into terms with one another even with those circumstances?...this is Itazura na Kiss.  
 
One of the biggest strengths LA actually had for Itazura na Kiss also brings up is the ""hierarchy"" of ""just being smart"" isn't all you need, if you don't have some god damn compassion to go along with your smarts, perfectly manifested in both Kotoko and Naoki, they are both diametric opposites to this, but together they not only help each other, but they help everyone else in the process and sure they ""don't demolish the hierarchy"", but more or less brings up the issue with the manifestation of the main protagonists and that is usually by their highschool arc, however later on it goes into evolve the message as ""divert from the hierarchy of intelligence is everything"" to ""determination"" mostly in the form of Kotoko. Next is that Itazura na Kiss just isn't a ""highschool romance anime"", as it does push settings from highschool to college to even career life with how this kind of relationship ""develops"" even further than the ""will they won't they"" status of the main duo of Naoki and Kotoko and that in itself is actually refreshing. Finally, Itazura na Kiss has ALOT of characters, and for the most part the majority of the characters are decent except for the characters like Yuuko Matsumoto voiced by Yuki Masuda that are just obstacles or ""generic romantic rival love interests"" trying to get in the way of Kotoko and Naoki relationship, however there are even what LA can call ""minor character focused episodes"" that do focus on the ones LA just mentioned before and some newer characters gets this, one surprisingly character being the Motoki Kikyou voiced by Mitsuki Saiga a guy who prefers to be a girl and he gets a very dedicated half-episode about his gender and how society viewed it through traditional eyes and for a 2008 anime, it's a uniquely ""current"" issue even now. But even with these kind of characters and the beta couples that form, they too become likable by the end of it and they too evolve or go through their own obstacles as much as Kotoko does...well to the point that LA was rooting is that if the beta couples and the minor characters have more of a focused and better development than our alpha couple...well that going into more detail in the next paragraph. 
 
LA will say this bluntly as possible, but the biggest and most annoying flaw to Itazura na Kiss is Naoki Irie himself, why?...well it's his personality and his utter resistance to change. Irie's main deal is that he for the majority of the screentime he has, has a cold demeanor to almost everyone cept probably his family but his personality STAYS LIKE THIS THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME, sure he opens up ""at times"" especially in the more genuine dramatic times, but would ANYONE like a person who almost NEVER opens up only when it doesn't go his way?...even when Kotoko and Naoki's relationship progresses from highschool to college to career a la dating to married...he shows no emotion to help UNLESS he has actual competition in the romantic sense or a dramatic plot twist occurs plotwise. This is kinda what happens if your main love interest is and have always will be a deadpan emotionless being, only in URGENT moments for cheap melodrama he reacts, thus it becomes a completely one-sided romance in which the anime itself ACKNOWLEDGES. We ARE suppose to root for Kotoko and Naoki right???. Sure a similar anime LA can think of is Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji has the same love duo with similar personalities especially concerning the main male love interest, but even THAT anime has almost the same problem as Itazura na Kiss has...ONLY WORSE. LA knows that after Episode 19, Naoki FINALLY starts slowly opening up to Kotoko bit by bit, episode by episode but for that development LA will say that ""your 11 episodes too late (Ep.9-20), it took you long enough!!!"". The only other flaw LA sees in Itazura na Kiss are all the ""love interests"" concerning Naoki throughout the anime, many of which DO bring up good points that he should be with people like himself, however the majority of them goes into the ""rival love interest for Kotoko just because"" and inevitably, we know they can't rival Kotoko (through basic romance tropes)...though some do cross the line to the point of trying to break up the two main love duo out of spite or jealousy. As for Kotoko's love interests, well they actually have a semblance concerning the plot and the romance involving Kotoko and Naoki who though one is slightly melodramatic (*cough* Kinnosuke's), question their diametric opposite relationship as whole compared to Naoki's generic love interests sans Christine. Nonetheless it's just another obstacle Kotoko has to go through to be with Naoki and annoyingly so. 
 
LA's favourite characters goes quite easily to Kotoko Aihara voiced by Nana Mizuki as you can actually relate to her and feel her plight from an academically and romantics standpoint, the only other character that came close to her was Naoki Irie's mother Noriko voiced by Naoko Matsui, sure she's a doting parent and utterly ships Naoki with Kotoko, but she's one of brightest spots of hope to the series, as she is the only one actual good advice ad helps Kotoko is some tough spots concerning Naoki, finally on the minor characters, Christine Robbins voiced by Yuuko Gotou was a final great hope spot for likable characters and her romantic goals were admirable even if it's similar to Kinnosuke and Kotoko's earlier plot point but gender reversed. On the other spectrum, LA's most hated character in the series is if you can easily guess it Naoki Irie...he had the most problems with the anime as a whole and just his presences of ""not helping his relationship with Kotoko"" made the romantic aspects of the anime even more annoying...yeah not only is the main crux of the anime's problems Irie but diametrically the opposite in likability as well. LA knows LA is defending Kotoko soo much but that's only because Kotoko goes through soo much from jealous rival love interests, crazy married women to Kotoko's own personal goals and problems of her own to try and match Irie's pedestal and she almost gets NOTHING in return for all she's done. Oddly enough it's nice to see that Itazura na Kiss' HUGE cast doesn't exactly revolve around Kotoko and Naoki (cept family and current friends because being obvious) as many of the characters have cameos way later on after Kotoko and Naoki progresses through life and the minor characters (yes even those stereotypical love interests LA mentioned in the above paragraph) have their own lives, developments and goals of their own, LA can easily put this up as a HUGE strength to Itazura na Kiss that LA missed. 
 
In terms of voice acting, the voice acting has some decent voice acting for the most part, Nana Mizuki as Kotoko has the typical heroine who's in love trope, but she does veer ALOT into the screaming shrill jealousy vocals that gets VERY annoying, though be it it's playing against the type for Nana Mizuki, but even with her broad vocals, the majority for her is the ditzy but nearly shrill scream queen vocals. There is Engrish in this anime and ohh boy does some of the background vocals have the Engrish being strong in this one, if you want to hear some typically awkward Engrish, Itazura na Kiss has it in the spades (Though Yuuko Gotou as Christine was ""ok"" enough for ""Engrish"" standards). For the most part the majority of seiyuu's do an ""ok"" job overall, but LA's favourite voice actor would go to Naoko Matsui as the doting mother of Naoki Irie, her shipping and eccrenticites all the way through was consistent and enjoyable. In the shrill side of things, some of the female VERY minor characters have these shrill vocals but the cream of the crop of shrillness goes to Jinko Komori voiced by Kinoko Yamada had one of the shrillest voices rivaling Chitose Morinaga voicing Flora Flemm from Asterisk War 2 most recently, LA doesn't have anything against Jinko as a character, she to like Satomi Ishikawa voiced by Risa Hayamizu is a supporting character to Kotoko, but seriously...Kinoko's vocals was annoyingly shrill. 
 
In terms of animation, the animation by TMS Entertainment, for the most part the animation has many of the trademarks of the typical shoujoness from the emoticons to the bishie sparkles. Character designs are pretty colorful though some characters gets the ""looks like her daughter/mother vibe"" at times, though due to the animation they get during the ""comedic scenes"" and the ""Kotoko jabbing moments"" goes pseudo-chibi and add that to the exaggeration is typical in Itazura na Kiss and quite often especially from Noriko Irie and Kotoko. Overall the animation is decent and if LA could say the animation in two words it's ""typical shoujoness"", it's not a bad thing though but LA won't really rave the animation as it's not utterly perfect it's just ""decent"" but that's about it. 
 
Halfway through the anime, once Kotoko is in medical school, well it gets melodramatic. But that's not why LA is pointing this out nor is it the ""bad melodrama you think it is"", once a new love interest for Kotoko..yes Kotoko, arrives by the form of Keita Kamogari voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, he brings up a VERY good point of ""why did you marry him?"" and LA utterly agreed with him, why?...as Naoki is STILL COLD towards her and hardly any help to her and hardly even communicates with Kotoko with HER problems instead whines about his and carries on with his goals only...once again...why do we have to root for these two? and sure by the halfway point many of the minor characters have evolved outside some of the stereotypical roles like Christine Robbins as a love interest for Naoki, Kinnosuke Ikezawa voiced by Shuuhei Sakaguchi a love interest for Kotoko (and a character in which LA supported his romantic goals ""for the most part"") and Yuuki Irie voiced by Romi Park (the snarky little brother of Naoki) and that in itself helped as LA had an obvious annoyance with the snarky annoying Yuuki Irie, but even HE got better over time and development and even the change of settings from highschool to college was a great transitional change, but if the all these can change yet if one of your main characters hardly or takes FAR TOO LONG TO...well again...it becomes a black stain to an otherwise interesting romance anime. 
 
You could defend Naoki that his cold personality is a hard thing to change as well as his career goals gets in the way of his romantic life, but LA will remind you that Naoki DID really like Kotoko quite early on, he just couldn't express it and fine LA will say that that is a quite honest statement...what LA couldn't understand is even if he couldn't express his true feelings correctly (or at all) even after marriage is him try to resist his personality and personal goals over his romance (only at the last moment for cheap melodrama) because he DOES realize that he is married to someone...he ""is"" a genius right? and fine once again you can even defend that as him being socially unaware and more focused on his career than his romance. Defend Naoki or not, either way LA wanted to pull the clip of Stephen Hawking shouting ""PUT SOME F-*-ING EMOTION INTO IT"" at Naoki for this and easily the source of the romance being quite annoying for the first half well for LA anyways. 
 
Thankfully the ending and LA might as well say it the last 6 episodes and Naoki's romantic flaws had improved with every episode and both the romance and drama (medical drama anyways) blended quite well together when before it was clashing quite alot. The last 6 episodes really did make payoff to all the romantic annoyances from Naoki, though the only new flaw LA saw from these last 6 episodes were that the transitions from career life to ""the next step for our two main duo"" were slightly rushed, nonetheless LA was pretty surprised the drama and romance blended especially well even for Kotoko and Naoki AT LAST as well as the minor character sub-plotlines were focused on along with the ending. Oddly the last episode is an aftermath of Episode 24 but the whole meat of Episode 25 is a flashback event and it also felt like it caused Naoki's emotions to be put into question as it was placed after their marriage (as he's similar to Episode 24 but having his constant teasing at the same time when he was suppose to be utterly emotionless towards Kotoko, but you can rule this out ""maybe"" because he's near family relatives thus he opened up but still.), thus LA would just question why couldn't Episode 24 be the final episode, it had a great dramatic and fulfilling conclusion...just seemed that TMS Entertainment needed to fill the quota or something. Nonetheless even with all the flaws and strengths of Itazura na Kiss' final 6 episodes, the ""ending"" (Ep. 24) was a great way to finish what was an annoyingly cold-hearted one-sided romance it was at the beginning to turn it into a nearly solid romantic drama anime. 
 
It is quite obvious LA's main issue with Itazura na Kiss, Naoki Irie overall brought the entire anime down, he never changes his personality or attitude and he only changes temporarily for cheap melodrama and cling to Kotoko ""just because"" and if the anime series changes and evolves without him then it becomes a HUGE detriment to the anime and even worse in a romantic stance. Itazura na Kiss has it's strengths of the refreshing kind what with it being not merely a highschool romance anime, but it progressing into college and even to their career lives and with the time passing, even it's minor characters changing for the better, but if even Naoki Irie doesn't care about his OWN romantic relationship and evolves without him, why should we care?...Kotoko definitely deserved better than this MUCH more quickly. Itazura na Kiss as a romance is to be seen more as a sidenote melodrama and not until the final 6 episodes it truly becomes a romance, as a drama, it's strengths comes from our main duo's satellite characters more they get sidelined (even though they're the FOCUS) for the most for better development and content as well as again, it's final 6 episodes. Itazura na Kiss skirts the line between an annoying romance and a progressively changing dramatic anime. LA might of gotten Stockholm Syndrome as much as LA hated Naoki quite early on and for the first half of the anime but Itazura na Kiss as a whole is a decent romantic anime, it has it's character flaws and blinded romance elements, but it is it's Itazura na Kiss' other ""features"" from it's progressively evolving settings in life as well as it's likable minor characters as well it's final 6 episodes that holds up which is why LA will call Itazura na Kiss a ""decent romance""...but it could have been a bit better with our unsympathetic lead putting some god damn effort into the romance department making the romance element a bit better and less annoying...but C'est la vie...or is it C'est Anime?.

    So now that I've finally watched this really popular anime from two years ago, the only summary that comes to mind is: ""What did I expect?"" 
If I said that I am a fan of sports-focused anime, I'd be lying. I am obssessed with beautiful art styles and outstanding animation though, so after having it recommended for way too long, I gave up and spent some time with Yuri!!! on Ice. 
And to be fair, I already knew what I'm gonna get out of it. Some incredibly drawn scenes, breathtaking choreographies, a lot of innuendos and most importantly - a romance between two main male characters. And, surprisingly, it did work in a way. 
Since it's a series about ice skaters, everyone can justify a bit (or more) of feminine, tight suits wearing men. Everything here is shiny, pretty, mesmerizing, and attractive in a way. 
Yes, I gotta admit, something about all these dancing boys who blush at basically everything, something about how they interact with one another and, obviously, how they show themselves off on a rink is just hot and it may be hard to turn your sight away. 
Of course, as I mentioned earlier, the main story is suplemented with a romance between main character, Yuri, and his coach, Victor. And it also works! 
In this world, where everyone expresses their gratitude by hugs, crying and tender gestures, it's only common sense for those two to start a romantic relationship. We can see it's development and I just can't help but say that it is... Cute. Very cute even. 
But it all just seems really pale when compared to the musical side of this show.  
I mean, it makes sense that an anime focused on dancing has a great soundtrack, but here the creators went a bit further. Different songs used by different characters perfectly mirror their personalities and just sound amazing overall. I really listened to some of them after I finished the show and that is unusual for me! 
So even if the story is pretty basic and follows the usual themes of getting from rock bottom to the top of the world, everything surrounding the main plot is is so enjoyable, that you don't really mind some cliches. It's not a must-watch for everyone but it is a nice little show to watch on a cold, winter evening.

    While not perfect, it came pretty damn close. 
 
Without going into spoilers, the anime is the story of Violet's development as a person - from a seemingly emotionless automaton to... something else. It's important to remember that, because if you go into this expecting constant kickass battle scenes or lots of humor you're going to be pretty disappointed. As an emotional story that explores a number of characters and makes you care for them, though, it excels; even characters that seem obnoxious or unlikable at first are usually developed into something memorable. 
 
Violet herself is the protagonist, of sorts, but not the charismatic leading lady - that role falls more to the many other charismatic characters through the show, almost all of whom are unnervingly attractive, like god DAMN there is some good breeding stock in this world if even random nobody NPCs are 10/10 handsome as hell. Anyways, back to the review. Through their stories, Violet understands and comes to terms with her own; again, no spoilers so I'm not gonna go into detail how and where she ends up, I'll just say that the show does a fantastic job about making you care about people that you don't expect to. 
 
There were a few times I felt like they forced the emotional aspect a little bit, but most scenes have solid heft to them - I definitely cried a few times throughout and got very emotional a number of other times. 
 
Art wise the anime excelled - I don't see any world in which it wasn't an easy 10/10. Animation is phenomenal, natural events and character models look incredible... pretty art doesn't make an anime good by any means, but it doesn't hurt to have some of the best looking characters in modern anime, either. 
 
Sound wasn't memorable in terms of being something I'd replay on a regular basis, but did the job extremely well in anime, no complaints there. 
 
Story was - well, I'll just say there weren't too many surprises overall but it was handled very well. Hard to go into much detail without major spoilers but all things considered it was good. 
 
Characters did well overall, a few of the supporting characters felt a little underdeveloped but in general I liked them and you could tell they had their own lives and goals outside of Violet's story. 
 
All things considered I felt it was a solid 9/10 anime. Similar to Ancient Magus Bride in a lot of ways, from a human pseudoprotagonist who barely thinks of themselves as one to the focus on natural beauty and the value of life. If you liked one I think you'll definitely like the other. I personally loved them both, though I think Ancient Magus Bride being an easy 10 is probably what pushed this down to a 9 in comparison for me.

    My anime Review of: Nisekoi! (Note: this is my first time reviewing so if I missed anything important, I apologize in advance) 
 
Story-5.7 
It’s just simple! 2 Families are fighting! In order to Stop it, the son/daughter of the 2 Gangs have to fake dating each other! Hence the title “Nisekoi”. But there’s one catch. They don’t like each other! Thus the beginning of a generic Rom-Com anime! Seriously? They have to fake date each other in order to stop the fighting? There are more EASIER ways to solve that! The 2 Boss of the gangs don’t want to fight but their men hate each other that much that they don’t obey their boss? Really? And the only way to solve this is for the son/daughter of the 2 boss has to be in a fake relationship? That Totally Makes Sense. And about the key thing. I think it’s just an excuse for the harem to happen.But they did one thing in the story right. The Phasing. The Phasing of this anime is well executed. And I like when instead of making it 23 or a 24 episode anime, they made it 20 instead. They knew that they couldn’t Prolong the Anime more because they might fuck shit up. That or Shaft just got tired animating it. Other than that, I really have nothing to say anymore.    
 
Characters-8 
Yes! Another Dense Main Character! Well, he isn’t really that dense but…… Another Dense Main Character! Moving on. The characters are really likeable. Although they’re all a little bit generic. Just a little bit. All of the characters’  development is….. meh. By far the weakest one is Marika. She has little screen time and development. I wish we could’ve explored her a bit more. I got to give props for the supporting characters. They did a great job. How about Raku and Chitoge you ask? The Main Protagonist and the Main Female Lead? No DOUBT, ONE OF THE BEST anime couples I have ever seen. Their chemistry is just so good. TeamChitoge All the way!. The characters were the key factor to this anime. Good job Characters 
 
Music-7.5 
The openings are the type of “It’s good but nothing more”. How about the ending songs? Man, they have a lot of ending songs. My personal favorite one is Recover Decoration because Bitch it’s KAWAII. They all have different ending songs for different characters. And I really have to give Shaft props for the Animation. The using of different bright colors and shapes. It’s just amazing. The soundtrack are good. Nothing much to say. Over all, the music in this anime is Good. Nothing more, nothing less. 
 
Animation-8.5 
As you have may known, This was animated by Shaft. And Shaft has never ceased to disappoint me. Not until Mekaku City Actors came along. The animation was gorgeous. Using of different styles and colorings. It’s just wonderful to the eyes. The animation itself is fairly average compared to the animes this time year. But they style is what it makes it beautiful. And off course, It’s not shaft if there’s no Legendary Head Tilt.    
 
Personal Enjoyment-9 
I Enjoyed The Fuck out of Nisekoi When it was in its first weeks. I stopped it because I got bored of it. After watching it again and finishing it. I still enjoyed it.   
 
Overall Score-7.74 
It is not something amazing. In the end it is just another Romance, Comedy, Harem anime. And what does romance, comedy, harem anime does best? Is to make your day happy (And in some cases, make you have a boner) And I couldn't wish for anything better

    *SPOILERS BELOW* 
 
Contains opinions of all four seasons released to date. 
 
One thing I should note is that I watched all four seasons released at the time of writing, consecutively: High School DxD > New > BorN > Hero, in order. So my opinion may differ slightly from someone who took a multi-year break between Seasons 3 and 4. 
 
 
--(Maybe) Useful Part-- 
 
[What Was Done Well] 
 
-Soundtrack in some moments. 
 
 
Obviously, my (and probably every viewer's) hope is that there as many things as possible here, preferably to the point where there are too many to count. But off the top of my head, this is the only thing that came to mind for this season. It's the only thing that stood out to me in a not-bad-kind of way. 
 
 
 
[What Can Be Improved] 
 
-Animation Consistency: It's hard to be immersed in the show when a character's face shape and features morph over the course of several frames and basically take on 10 different appearances throughout the season. Much better in Seasons 1-3. 
 
-Animation Smoothness: Choppy/stuttering animation at many moments. Character facing front, then seemingly ""teleports"" and faces right. Where did the frames in between go? Again, better in Seasons 1-3. 
 
-Proportions: Asia's fingers looking like Baymax's in one scene (google Baymax images for reference). Some overlap with Animation Consistency (body proportions morphing; looking different between episodes). Red Dragon Emperor Armour, as well as countless other characters and objects, looking really off proportion-wise at times, breaking the immersion. Was better in Seasons 1-3. Notice the pattern? 
 
-Textures (especially good in Seasons 1-3): Probably linked to Level of and Attention to Detail stated below. Not just skin, but fabric and other materials of clothes; hair, metal, glass, and environmental details like carpets, curtains, concrete, grass and rocks were much more convincing and believable in Seasons 1-3. 
 
-Visual Effects: Everything on-screen becomes a blur during epic action scenes with many things happening. Battle between Gremory family and Cao Cao's team could've been amazing with the flurry of Sacred Gear and Balance Breaker activations and reveals, but visual effects and camera angles were confusing and hard to follow. Magic spell casts and armour transformations also looked better in, yes you guessed it, Seasons 1-3. 
 
-Level of and Attention to Detail: Lack of shadows in many scenes, detail of light reflections off metallic armour and surfaces, definition of drawing lines on characters/Red Dragon Emperor armour (difficult to tell one body part from another). One example is any scene in Issei's classroom—in Seasons 1-3, you could see trees and scenery outside the windows. In this season, they're just flat, white, opaque surfaces, making the classroom feel boxed-up. 
 
...and really just the overall animation and production quality. 
 
-Character designs: Combination of Proportions, Textures and Attention to Detail mentioned above. 
 
-DIRECTING: Probably a huge factor, if not the biggest factor over the quality of this season. Scenes, especially action sequences in the first half of this season, were extremely difficult to follow at times. Many plot points were abruptly brought in without clear explanation/development. In previous seasons, when something ridiculous happens in the plot, oftentimes there was at the very least some effort spent in trying to explain and convince things to the viewer. That's absent here. Dialogue felt rushed and forced at times. 
 
-Intonations and nuances in characters' voices: Characters speak too fast and seem out of character at times. Definitely not due to a lack of talent, as the previous three seasons have shown great performances from the voice acting cast (am guessing it could be due to the director(s)). Change noticeable when watching consecutively from Seasons 1-4. Seasons 1-3 were much more consistent in this respect; voices were much more on point, conveying the exact emotion or vibe intended. In this season, voices sometimes seemed odd for a particular character (Koneko shouting?). I felt that there was, however, some improvement in the last few episodes. 
 
-Pacing: Lots of abrupt time jumps and flashbacks that confused me, without giving signals and smoothly transitioning into them. As a result, I was sometimes left wondering why I was looking at a particular scene, only to realise it was all in Issei’s head afterwards. This is something that Seasons 1-3 excelled in as well—it was easily and quickly inferred when Issei was dreaming due to the scene composition and voice effects. 
 
 
Of course, I am writing all these while hoping that they will be dramatically improved in the next season(s). That's not to say the previous three seasons were flawless of course (I could make a list of things to be improved for those seasons as well, though it'd probably be shorter..), but the focus of this review is on Season 4 after all. And so, I guess I've come to the end of this part. Now, for the next segment... 
 
 
 
--Useless Part (aka rant)-- 
 
One thing that makes me admire anime is the high level of attention to detail, from the eyes, hair, clothes/character designs to the environmental details, visual effects and directing. It's what makes it different from cartoons (no offence to cartoons though). So... 
 
WHYYYYYYY?!!!! It's hard to appreciate how high the production quality was in the first three seasons until watching this. Please change back to Studio TNK that worked on the first three seasons if possible! T.T Sorry (Studio Passione), I'm probably sounding like a real snob here, but it pains me to imagine how well and elegantly the concepts from the light novel could've been brought to life with the previous studio (Sairaorg and Issei's battles, the Kyoto arc). A really good example is by simply watching the Openings of all four seasons. For Season 4 it almost feels as if I put on a pair of ""Cartoonification Goggles"". Everything looks more like a.........cartoon? Numerous parts in the first half of this season were so bad it's ridiculous (ughh sorry, doesn't feel good to say this as well). At times it almost feels like the show is making fun of its audience. This is purely hypothetical, but I got the feeling that in previous seasons, the production team and voice actors actually _enjoyed_ the process of making the show, whereas this season, it seemed like they didn't share that same enjoyment and felt kinda awkward and unfamiliar, perhaps understandably so. 
 
In the previous three seasons, the flaws that held the series back at times were mainly plot-related. Production-wise (the process of bringing the ideas and concepts to life on screen), it was hard to have complaints. Contrarily, the only thing that's holding this season together is the story and characters, mostly built up from the first three seasons, and subsequently developed further especially in the second half of this season. Animation-wise...sigh. The thing is, if my focus was simply on the story and characters, I would've just read the light novels. The point of watching the anime is to see how everything comes to life, from imagination to materialisation. 
 
I know there may be a common sentiment that people watch High School DxD simply for the fanservice. But I'm sure there are people who, despite enjoying the comedic situations and light-hearted fanservice, are kept interested as well because of the plot development, worldbuilding, and chemistry between the characters, and want to see these things come to life on screen. And so, I don't agree with the mentality that slapping together a bunch of fanservice scenes and shoving it to fans is the way to go, with the plot existing solely to hook those scenes together. Not saying that this is what happened, but just stating that the main storyline, characters, production quality etc. shouldn't take a backseat to simply providing fanservice to satisfy fans. What's ironic is that I think fans would enjoy it even more if the production team focused on delivering the story experience in the most immersive and best way possible. Not to mention new fans would arise. 
 
 
[Regarding Episode 0...] 
 
Although I am normally not an advocate of changing source material in adaptations due to respect for the original author and creators of a piece of work, if Episode 0 of this season is supposed to be the original source version of Season 3’s ending, I can see why the previous director decided to deviate from the original storyline a little at the end of Season 3 (if that's true). 
 
Off the top of my head, here are some common aspects in both Season 3 Episodes 9-12 and Season 4 Episode 0 (words in brackets describe Season 3 in comparison to Season 4): 
-the Juggernaut Drive reveal (more atmospheric, voice-acting and animation-wise) 
-progression of events (better pacing; doesn't feel as rushed) 
-Great Red's reveal (more epic, and again, better pacing) 
-Ophis's appearance and character design (looking into her eyes makes the viewer feel as if they're looking into an endless darkness—making her fitting of the alias Infinite Dragon God) 
-Sports Festival (more believable; festive atmosphere conveyed; much greater attention to detail; not rushed) 
-fight scene between Shalba and Issei (action much easier to follow, better visual effects, dialogue and pacing) 
-Boob Dragon song reveal (funnier; more fitting of the atmosphere; Season 4's just felt really off and out of place) 
 
Furthermore, the foreshadowing of the Welsh Blaster Bishop mode at the end of Season 3 was well done in my opinion. It set up the premise well for the events in Season 4. How those events eventually played out in Season 4 is a whole other story... 
 
To be fair, perhaps there were budget and time constraints, and any number of other factors, or because Episode 0 was just a retcon so less effort was spent on it? I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that it felt extremely rushed, forced and unnatural, almost seeming as if the production team thought, ""Guys, there’s some unhappiness with Season 3’s ending, so let’s quickly toss something together and give it to those unhappy fans."" 
 
This is why I think it seems understandable that the previous director decided to deviate slightly from the source material at the end of Season 3 if he did. While not spoiling the serious atmosphere built up from the Juggernaut Drive’s reveal, Episodes 9-12 managed to further develop the characters in a why that strengthened the bonds shared between them, while not omitting important plot points as well (Great Red, Welsh Blaster Bishop, Sports Festival, Boob Dragon song). It seems to me a smoother way of navigating from the tense atmosphere of the Juggernaut Drive act to the more light-hearted atmosphere of the Sports Festival segment, and really tying up that arc in a nice manner, while leaving the series available to adapt more volumes of the light novel if desired (as no important plot points were left out, thus the story's direction didn't change) 
 
This really emphasises how much of a difference good directing (and perhaps screenwriting, storyboarding, etc.?) makes. It's a whole different studio after all—there were probably many changes across the board. And yes, I'm aware that it was the author's decision to switch studios :/ 
 
 
[Another note on animation consistency...] 
 
In previous seasons (1 to 3), you could take a scene from Season 1 that was made years earlier, put it in Season 3 (which is something they did in Season 3), and it would still look fitting. A person watching that scene in Season 3 for the first time wouldn't have been able to tell it was made years ago (from Season 1). Man, even the animation quality and character designs in the OPENINGS of the first three seasons looked consistent with content in the actual body of the episodes. In this fourth season, just looking at Asia's face in the Opening and in the episodes...well I don't even feel like talking about it. 
 
 
[All in all...] 
 
In terms of satisfaction of the experience for me, Season 2 felt like the peak (so far). For all four seasons in order: 
High School DxD: 8/10 
High School DxD New: 9/10 
High School DxD BorN: 8/10 
High School DxD Hero: 6/10 
 
It feels kind of a waste, almost heartbreaking at times, as the prerequisites for a great show are definitely there—amazing voice acting cast and an intriguing story, especially with a high-profile Rating Game this season. Perhaps because I watched the 4 seasons consecutively, while watching through this season, I couldn’t help but keep imagining how it would look like if Studio TNK had animated it; how epic certain character reveals and designs, action sequences and fights could potentially have been. 
 
Regardless, I honestly respect all the time, effort and work put into producing this show. I could be oblivious to a thousand different factors that caused it to turn out the way it did. 
 
I really hope that either Studio TNK takes on the next season if there’s one, or Studio Passione improves tremendously in terms of production quality, or a completely different studio takes over the project and brings this series to new heights. 
 
Something tells me that if done right, the subsequent seasons can provide unforgettable, amazing experiences. Not necessarily masterpiece-level, but a satisfaction level of 9/10 in terms of the experience? Definitely. 
 
P.S. This is my first review. Yay~ ＼(^o^)／

    This was one I watched when I was still relatively new to anime and it absolutely blew me away. Gurren Lagann never slows its roll and always asks how it can push its reality further and asks more and more of your suspension of disbelief. To the point where the final battle takes place with a robot who's dimensions are measured in light years in a battle that takes place in between the fabric of space and time whilst galaxies are being thrown and it never feels like its that crazy in the context of the story. Pushing past the limits of whats capable and what you're own limits is the apex of the story in pretty much every facet. 
 
 The core concept of having just ""hype"" as its power system means it can just go balls-to-the-walls and have as much fun as it wants to while not cheating any of the typical mid-battle power ups that can plague the shounen genre. Though I hesitate to call this show a shounen. The characters I don't think are all to deep but the way they interact with their world and the dynamics between the cast is some of the most memorable and some of my favorites. If you haven't seen Gurren Lagann, do yourself and solid and believe in the me that believes in you and just dive in.

    Before Reading - We all have different opinions, but it won't hurt to give it a try. 
 
Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, what a beautiful anime. I was very wary of starting this first, but I said hey lets give it a try and it was definitely worth it. 
 
""I hate nice girls. Just by exchanging greetings with them will get them on your mind. Start texting each other, and your heart will be set a flutter. If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your logs and grinning like a fool. However, I won't be fooled again. That's what your kind calls kindness. If you are nice to me, you're also nice to others. I always end up nearly forgetting that. Reality is cruel, so I'm sure lies are a form of kindness. Thus, I say kindness itself is also a lie. I always ended up with these expectations. And I always ended up with these misunderstandings. And before I knew it, I stopped hoping. A highly-trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing. That's why I will always… hate nice girls."" 
 
This got me instantly intrigued to the story, this might appeal to some people this might not. However this is just one of the amazing quotes our main character Hachiman Hikigaya says.  
 
Story - It was meh, don't go into the anime raising your standards for a beautiful well written heart warming story. I am going to be straight up it isn't. 
 
Art - The character designs were very nice, except for the main character don't drop the show from the main characters looks. 
 
Sound - It was meh, I don't really ever pay attention to the sound too concentrated on the show itself. 
 
Character - This is where Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru shines the most. 
 
Hachiman Hikigaya - Is this normal kid who views the world in a pessimistic way, and gets stuff done even if it isn't the most likable way. 
 
Yukino Yukinoshita - A beautiful, smart girl who is envied by the girls and has all the guys attention. Her personality is unique and you will learn as you watch the show.  
 
That is about all the interesting characters in the story, but these to make one hell of a good show. 
 
Enjoyment - I enjoyed this a lot, mainly because I am a rom/com fan, I was kinda disappointed because the romance doesn't really get anywhere, if this is a turn off than I have no idea what to say.  
 
Overall - This was a great anime, with likable characters. I suggest mature viewers to watch the young ones might no understand.

    I heard on the internet that that this was a great show. it looked good so i watched it. and by the time I finished the show I was dissatisfied. 
 
why was I dissatisfied with it, its mainly because of the main characters. 
 the plot seemed to focus on shinya and Akane were wich probably the most bland characters in the story. 
 
Shinya- tried to make him look cool but never really was 
Akene- crybaby wuss with cringy dialogue 
 
Besides the bad main characters that ruined most of the show I also thought the setting was bland. its just because there's to many stories with similar utopian settings.Other wise i thought this show looked good and also had a semi decent plot. 
 
Conclusion---- 
I would recommend this to most anime viewers (less for younger viewers) because its interesting but might get boring with a bad attention span.

    When I watched the first episode of Guilty Crown I had high expectations for this show. I, like many others, was amazed at the first episode. The fluidity of the animation and the clear, beautiful artwork was very appealing. I am in fact a fan of this show, I do not hate it. However, I am very disappointed with the way it turned out. 
 
Story - The story is terrible. That's my point, short and simple. Although the animation and artwork was topnotch, the writers really screwed the pooch here. The story was all over the place, in short it was very disorganized. I had hope for this show at first. The first four episodes were explosive. They were beautiful, had great animation scenes, introduced a few new characters, and set a foundation for what the story could have been. I expected something amazing, but then everything started fading away. I felt as if I had been backhanded by the writers. What was waiting for me instead, was much worse than I could have imagined. There were far too many plot-holes in Guilty Crown, more than you would see in the average anime. Not to mention the pacing was horrible. One important thing to mention is that Guilty Crown uses countless Deus Ex Machinae in its story to advance the already crumbling plot. Far too many details in the story were left unexplained such as the Da'ath organization. The one thing that could have changed my views on this show was whether the ending was good or not. Sadly, it wasn't. In fact, it was the worst ending I have ever seen in my life. You may ask me why I care so much about the ending. Well, I am easily satisfied. Just have a good storyline and an acceptable ending that matches said storyline and I will be happy. Guilty Crown accomplished none of the two. 3/10 
 
Art - The art was simply breathtaking. The clear backgrounds and special effects were the few things that enticed me to finish this series. The colors in the environment would clearly match the scenes nearly EVERY time. Character designs were also exceptional. In my opinion, Guilty Crown had the best art compared to other anime series released in it's timespan. 10/10 
 
Sound - The music in Guilty Crown was outstanding. The voice acting was great. The opening and ending themes were memorable. The music is also something I regret about watching Guilty Crown. The music was so beautiful that it still haunts me ever since I finished the last episode. I also loved the way the writers managed to place Inori's songs in the plot. That is probably the only thing the writers did that appealed to me. However, it is still unclear why they would actually make Inori's music a part of the story. What really won me over was the background music. Whenever something happened, I always looked forward to the music that would accompany the scene. 10/10 
 
Characters - The characters were mediocre at best. I hated Shu for most of the show. Inori may have been the more memorable character of the series, but she was nothing more than an emotionless, doll-like character who contributed nothing to the story. She also had no    back story, like the majority of the characters in Guilty Crown. My reasons for hating Shu was that he was a complete coward until late in the series. He had to have a character die in order to basically ""man"" up. I have seen the same trick done in so many different shows. It's not that it's bad, it's just that the show is already far too cliched already to be using the same trick that many shows have used over the years. Gai was an average character, I have no complaints about him. Ayase was one of the few character I liked in this show. She was a beautiful, strong-willed, and independent character who was also a paraplegic (something you don't see everyday in anime.) Seiga and Daryl are also two characters that I particularly liked. However, in the end, they did not play as big a role than I expected them to. Daryl's fate is also left unexplained, hence another plot-hole. Luckily, I managed to find one character that I adored, Hare. Her role in the story actually meant something to me. Her involvement in the story was also very limited unfortunately. Overall, most of the characters were lackluster, unoriginal, unmemorable, and had too little screen time. 5/10 
  
Enjoyment - I did enjoy this series. I enjoyed the music and the art but I was very disappointed by the characters and storyline. Had the story and characters been of the same quality as the sound and visuals, Guilty Crown could have been the best anime series of 2011-2012. I cannot stress this enough, I hated the ending. I hated it so much, that when the show ended, I was left speechless with a frown on my face. Afterwards I started screaming profanities at how terrible the ending was. I have never acted like that before, so obviously it was a surprise for me. I mean, I heard it was bad and many people raged at the ending, but I had no idea it was THAT bad. 6/10 
 
Overall - Speaking as a fan, this show had potential, too much potential to be honest. It had a great cast, a large budget, amazing music, and it had nothing to base itself on. It could've been as original as the writers wanted. Honestly, I believe the writers doomed this show. Guilty Crown did not leave me satisfied, in fact, it made me angry. Not at the story or ending  this time, but at the arrogance of the writers. Good artwork and music do not make up for a horrible plot. I would much rather watch an anime with a great plot but bad animation and music. The storyline, in my opinion, is the more preferable element. I am hoping for a continuation of the story, but then again, the ending nearly destroyed all hope for a second season. I can only rely on the poorly introduced Da'ath organization and the numerous plot-holes for a second season. I only want a continuation of the story to clear loose ends. An OVA is also acceptable. If we're lucky, it won't be atrocious as the original story. If you're are looking for an anime series that has a great story then I suggest you look elsewhere. If you watch mainly for artwork and music, then this series would be great for you. Just don't watch this show expecting a masterpiece, this show is far from one.  6/10

     Most people forget what Naruto is and what it is meant to be and start comparing it with anime that arrived a decade later. And it's almost impossible to assign numbers and evaluate a series like this one that has been running over a decade. Naruto was never a show made to compete with mind boggling story such as... I don't know let's say Cowboy Bebop for a lack of better example. But it was made in midst of a shounen revolution where the importance was placed on Friendship, goodness, and perseverance.  
 
Naruto is very little about ninjas. In fact it's very bad at portraying what ninjas are. But Naruto is creative at least. Taking this ninja genre and combining it into several martial and weapon arts to make this very unique show. Well unique is a bit subjective but whatever. I applaud the series for combining the natural elements, weapons, and even mixing human behaviors to create a world full of unique fighting techniques.  
 
Story wise, Naruto is about the character Naruto becoming the leader of his village. He is an orphan cursed with bearing a monster with him and the whole anime is about him overcoming the world of ninjas, which is filled with hatred and suspicion. See the series have some of the most fascinating characters. Each of them with their own background, although many of them could've been kept a secret for the better story progression and pacing. Many of these characters' actions are justified by their past and as the series progresses you can see how each of them changes and influences each other. However the best aspect of the series is also probably the worst aspect of it. While many main characters are given a good amount of attention and care and many of them are nurtured with logic, others just become fodder characters uttering 1 or 2 lines then their worth are never revisited again.  
 
The story of Naruto is about never giving up, making friends, and well, whatever standard shounens babble about. But Naruto is one of the few exceptions because Naruto is rarely a hypocrite and actually always stays around its core beliefs. As the series is ending, it's sad that many of the traits of the characters like Sasuke and Obito are reversing and villains are entering the infamous Dragon Ball complex (you enemy becomes bff lol), the main thing is Naruto remains Naruto: stupid and somehow still influential.  
 
After watching this series at different intervals and after watching other anime, I came to appreciate Naruto. Because I watched several long running shounen and nothing really even came close to the emotional appeal Naruto formed. I think I can safely say that this show truly keeps it promise and shows Naruto is a hardworking guy who becomes special.  
 
However, I still can't forgive this series for wasting the potential of so many characters, random power-ups, unnecessary glorification of Sasuke and Naruto (WE GET IT THEY'RE THE MAIN CHARACTERS) and Bleach-esque arse pulls. The fillers are downright horrible and let's not even explore the comedy. Seriously, many of the plot like Kaguya and other backstory could have been omitted, no they should have been omitted, to give Naruto a more refined ending but it is what it is.  
 
At the end of the day, Naruto is a good series about a guy never giving up as he faces challenge to save his friend and save his village. Indeed it is a tale of a gutsy ninja. Characters like Itachi, Jiraiya, and Pain are some of the noteworthy characters in all of anime. Naruto is a good series on what it stands for. Stop comparing it to high level, 13 episode series because all anime loses its lust after 500 episode mark.  
 
On a side note, this is not a proper review. Just whatever I feel about this series. I recommend it for the nostalgia and some really good fight scenes.

    Bounen no Xamdou is one of those series that took me by surprise. It was on my to watch list for a while, and I really trudged my way through a few misses before I found this one. It's hard to get a gist for what you're going to see by reading a synopsis, because it is a character driven story from start to finish. The overall story isn't bad, but it's really about the people in the story and their relationships with eachother. I was impressed, and it had a satisfying ending as well. Definitely this was a great series. 
 
It starts our looking like your stereotypical mecha, post war, children of war, superpowered series. I thought I was in for the same song and dance I've seen over and over again. I was surprised to find that this wasn't the case. After the main character is wisped away and his friends are left in the aftermath, the real story begins. The story does a good job of following all characters, and you are given plenty of time to develop an emotional bond to them all. There are not a lot of action filled scenes, but the ones you get are satisfying. It's pacing isn't too slow, but it definitely is never rushed either. All in all it's done really well. 
 
One thing that I was really impressed with is that some characters started out villainous and then seemed less and less evil as the story progressed. Others started out seemingly ok, but then became more and more villainous. Not one character was ever truly evil, and I felt most were likeable in their own way. As I said, this was  character driven story and it was done extremely well. 
 
I'll say the artwork and animation were pretty good, but the music and voice acting were top notch. The music was typically right on, and it really fed to the emotion in each scene. They really did a fantastic job. The voice actors hit their mark just about every time and it made for a great experience. 
 
If you don't mind story/character driven anime series with less action than character development then give this series a look. I thought it was great and would highly recommend it.

    It has been a long time since I've fallen in love with one character this much, let alone two, three, four gah the entire cast for this show is friggin great! 
 
The second half is definitely so much better than the first. Don't get me wrong, the first half is a fun FLCL trippy road trip through time and space but the second half is deeper and more heartwarming, more pulse pounding and overall just the better part of this anime. 
 
I nearly dropped this anime before the episode where they go to that desert world, I'm a fan of Henshin Hero shows so that one caught my attention to say the least. 
 
The last thing I want to touch on is that this anime is one of the best representations of parenthood I've ever seen, not gonna spoil it but this show certainly is a fine example of just how far parents will go to try and protect their children even if it's not for the child's own good in the end. 
 
The ending was very happy for a magical girl show in this day and age which is what I was dreading, not knocking Madoka but it's good to see some Shoujo heroine's can still earn their happy endings. 
 
Oh yeah, and the op and art are some of the catchiest and smoothest things I've seen in a long time. A big round of applause to Studio 3Hz, may just check out Dimension W now.

    Of course I would recommend watching the prequels to the series, or else watching this anime is completely pointless.  
This series (FMP, Fumoffu and TRS) is a perfect blend of comedy, suspense, and drama. I would suggest this anime to anyone who has a bit of free time and enjoys a good laugh. The plot of the series is severely lacking though. It introduces Kaname Chidori as being one of the ""whispered"" but after that it doesn't go into much depth about this being, which I thought could have played a bigger role in the series. But nonetheless the anime was still great. The character development was amazing, and if you've watched all 3 seasons then I'm sure you would agree. The art work for the 3rd season was a definite improvement from the first two, which I thought was a major plus! I very much enjoyed watching this anime, and I wish for a 4th season, but I know that is not going to happen.

    Personally, I thought the Death Note story line was perfect and as a manga enthusiast, first and foremost, I found the little add ins and changes a bit disturbing but the anime did attempt to be faithful to the original story which earns this an enjoyment rating a ten. The music, to my belief, was suited. The voice talents matched the character well. The story pacing good. Over all it was a good time spent. 
 
Story-wise, the watcher is confronted with the cliche, age-long question ""Does the end justify the means?"", ""Can killing be justified?"" entwined with psychological attacks, tactical mind war. The watcher takes sides and root for their player which usually representing something the individual believes personally. It's wonderful experience, a story that I believe shouldn't be missed. It's a cliche idea revolutionized and packaged for the modern time.

    Mob psycho season 2 is an anime produced by studio Bones with the original source material being a manga created by the mangaka known as ONE. The first season was released in 2016. I found the the first season to be a solid one but had a few problems that was not a big issue to drag it down.  
 
In season 2, there is a huge improvement. The animation manged to get a boost and I can only say wow. The fight scenes look incredibly gorgeous with some of the shots being one of the most memorable piece of art I have seen since Fate/Zero. 
 
The main strength is the characters in the series (especially Mob and Reigen). Mob managed to became one of the reasons to why season 2 was so great. Seeing Mob's growth was an incredible experience to witnesses and I am excited to see him grow even more. 
 
The weaknesses however is the pacing in the later parts of the series with some of the scenes being a little tedious. I think Mob and Reigen took a bit too much spotlight and from other supporting characters which was a little disappointing.  
 
In conclusion this series has once again reminded me why I love anime. Mob psycho 2 gets an (8.7)

    Man's relationship with the sea has always been one of awe and fear.  Awe from its immensity and depth; fear from its power.  Because we cannot explore it easily its mysteries that captivated our ancestors still resonate even today despite our technological advancements and control of our surface environment.   Umi Monogatari ~Anata ga Itekureta Koto~ tells the tale of two worlds fated to be apart but still must coexist as part of the same planet. 
 
Umi Monogatari's story is part magical adventure and part romance.  Marin and Urin are mermaid sisters from the sea world.  One day they discover a ring that has fallen from the sky world and they resolve to go to the surface to return the ring to its owner.  They don’t know that the ring was thrown into the sea by the heartbroken girl Kanon, who has just broken up with her boyfriend.  Marin soon finds Kanon and returns the ring but she is unwilling to accept it back. Through these actions, a dark power is accidently awoken and both Marin and Kanon discover their secret destinies. 
 
I was quite satisfied with the way the story unfolded overall.  Unlike a lot of similar series the show manages to stay on task for every episode and not devolve into a series of filler and service episodes only to return to the main story near the end.  There aren’t any ""Marin and Urin go to school"" or ""Mermaids at the Hot Springs"" episodes which I found quite refreshing.  For the most part the story is told at a very relaxed and pleasant pace.  There isn’t a lot of action though so I suspect some people will find its pacing to be boring at times.  However, I felt there was a lot of powerful and complex drama, particularly near the end that kept me interested throughout.  While not all of this necessarily works it was still quite enjoyable.  The ending was also satisfying and complete, wrapping up all of the important story elements. 
 
Marin and Urin are both sweet and likable girls.  They are naive to the surface world’s ways though perhaps not as much as they probably should have been.  We get a decent amount of back-story on the relationship between the two sisters and their past but it still doesn’t feel like you really know them that well.  Towards the series climax the drama surrounding them is much more compelling and powerful. 
 
Kanon feels like the most emotionally deep character in the series.  She is a bit of a dark character, especially when compared to someone like Marin who is full of love and energy.  Kanon is a girl who wants to be liked but just doesn’t know how to show it to people.  Often what she does show is the opposite of what she feels and leads people to have the wrong impression about her.  She’s referred to quite a bit as ""evil"" which I found a bit strange.  Perhaps it is something that just can’t be translated well because she’s not an evil person.  Her character grows tremendously over the series as she is able to overcome some of her emotional scars and accept and receive love as well as return it. 
 
The supporting cast is very well done.  The story does a nice job of making many of them fairly deep and interesting while keeping their actual screen time to a minimum to focus on the main storyline.  Kojima specifically, as he appears briefly in the first half of the series, he doesn’t speak and he is seen through Kanon's perspective.  So by the time we actually see him talking, the audience will have her view about him.  Though we find that Kanon's viewpoint is skewed from the truth do to her own personality quirks.  For a character that probably had less than 15 minutes of screen time through the entire anime he left quite an impression. 
 
As a villain I found Sedna to be intriguing.  Despite not having a physical form, she is a terrifying presence.  Mainly because you can relate to that dark inner voice that everyone hears from time to time.  She remains suitably mysterious throughout until the truth of her existence is finally revealed. 
 
Visually Umi Monogatari is very beautiful.  Both the surface and sea worlds are lovely and the magical effects and action are gorgeously animated.  The character designs are also cute and realistically proportioned.  I think my favorite piece of animation though was the EN theme which was just completely adorable and matched the song perfectly.  The OP theme is a bit sleepy but I thought was very fitting as an introduction to each episode. 
 
I enjoyed this series quite a bit and would give it my recommendation.  Though I suspect it will not necessarily appeal to everyone due to it's pacing and lack of action.  If you are in the mood for a relaxing series with good drama and romance and some lite action, then you should give this Sea Story a try.

    I was enjoying the horror and the creepiness until it was cleared out who Misaki Mei was. I love the concept of keeping the audience in the dark but when it was revealed that Misaki exist that took away everything. 
 
I hated the mindless wrap up of the series in the last two episodes. Everything was exaggerated in the 11th episode; if kids are killing they are going on a killing rampage and if they are calm then they do not give a fuck if hotel is on fire.  
 
The concept was great but didn't translated into a good story.

    The original run of the show was in 1985, and since then, the anime Dirty Pair has bounced from studio to studio, but never leaving the shows incredible charm, action, and the lovely duo behind. 
 
In the universe of “Dirty Pair,” humanity has spread across the universe and thus gave birth to the United Galactica and a corporation called the World Welfare Works Association (3WA) which our two main girls, Kei (red) and Yuri (blue) work for. The 3WA sends “trouble consultants” like Kei and Yuri to solve various problems, and in grand fashion, the two lovely angels cause nothing but destruction and mayhem wherever they go. 
 
In this particular hour-long OVA, Kei and Yuri are picked by the computer to investigate a mysterious plane explosion causing many people to simply go missing, much to the dismay of the Chief. And thus, that is all there is to it. Let the mayhem commence in typically awesome Dirty Pair action. 
 
Being an OVA, the characters and dramatics are a little over the top, such as the Chief reacting to the computer picking Kei and Yuri or the clothing options for the two; oh so space 80’s. However, the animation for Dirty Pair never looked better. Sound and music match fairly well for action sequences. Even the story is somewhat darker and has a more serious plot compared to the more over-dramatic humour the show usually brings. Some might deter from this new aspect of Dirty Pair and that is fine if looking for more of the original anime. 
 
Kei and Yuri are as lovable as ever, with Kei being the assertive flirt with a short fuse while Yuri is the more soft spoken and romantic type. Basically, Dirty Pair 005 is an OVA that creates a more serious atmosphere with still maintaining what is loved about the franchise, chicks with big sticks.

    Ok, yes, I'm definitely in the minority here, but I REALLY didn't enjoy this anime. I should've seen the signs when it looked like a serious show, but had a 'comedy'-tag - a combination that almost never works – but here we are.  
For now, I'll start with the things I liked about this anime... if only because getting through those is a LOT quicker, lol. 
 
First off, I have to admit, Drifters occasionally had some pretty decent and interesting strategies & tactics in its battles. For example in one instance towards the middle, Nobunaga ordered the elves that they were trying to save to dump the corpses they had from the fight before into their well and then run before the incoming troops of their enemy arrived. In case you don't know much about war-tactics: Throwing corpses into a well poisons the water inside, obviously making it undrinkable. This means that troops who want to use the village to refill their supplies and occupy the place can't do so, as the sole source of water is completely unusable. It's a standard tactic, aye, but I was still impressed to see it in use, as it showed that whoever made the manga this is based on had at least a basic understanding of war-tactics. 
Additionally, I think that the action-scenes themselves were pretty well handled. They weren't as flashy and clever as JoJo's nor were they as exciting as Rakudai Kishi's, but they were definitely better than the action-scenes in the majority of action anime I've seen. There was just something about the MC slicing up multiple bad guys that was actually somewhat fun to watch. 
 
Speaking of 'fun to watch', another thing I actually liked about this show was that it featured an actual Gatling Gun. Yes, I know, that's a weird thing to be excited about, but Mini-guns (and their ancestors, the Gatling Guns) are amongst the very few guns I actually like and they are almost never get featured in anything, so not only seeing the original GG, but also having it presented rather historically accurate was quite something for me. A very personal point, yes, but I think it still counts. 
The last thing I actually liked about this show was its Opening. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this show had one of the coolest openings of the last year. I actually went out of my way to search for the opening on YT to listen to it occasionally, because it's really that good. 
 
But that's where the pleasantries end. If you think that this sounds like a pretty interesting anime based on what you've read so far, don't worry, that's gonna change in just a minute. 
Let's start with the thing I hated the most about this anime: Its absolutely godawful attempts at Comedy. I'm fking serious. I don't think I've ever seen an anime where literally every single joke bombed completely. Every single time this anime felt like it was getting too decent, it decided to go into a completely terrible alternative art-style and make some of the characters perform the most tedious boke/tsukkommi routines I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Not to mention that even IF the jokes had been successful, they STILL would've been out of place, as there's very few ways to NOT make jokes seem OOP within a serious war setting. I honestly have NO idea why Drifters didn't just stay serious the entire time, as those were the times where this anime was actually bearable... most of the time. 
 
The next thing I want to talk about is the Art-style of this show. And I know, I've already said how horrible the 'joke-art-style' looked, but the one for the serious parts was actually also not something I enjoyed. Yes, it was unique and probably took a lot of effort, but that still doesn't change the fact that I thought that it looked... sub-par. Maybe it's because I'm a spoiled KyoAni fanboy, but I really could not get myself to accept the art in this anime. I've HEARD that it looks a lot like Hellsing Ultimate (which I can neither confirm nor debunk, as I haven't watched HU), so I suppose if you've liked the art in Hellsing, then you can completely ignore what I just said, lol. 
Next up is the character development in this anime... or rather the lack there of. Seriously, the only one with any personality in that bunch seemed to be Nobunaga himself and Saint-Germi. The rest of them seemed to either be one-dimensional warmongers (like the MC himself) or completely lacked any personality or presence whatsoever (like Yoichi Suketaka Nasu, who was part of the main cast... and completely and utterly personality-less.) Probably the most vexing example of a lack of character development was with what might possibly be the main villain: 'The Black King.' (one of those titles right out of the 'generic villain name'-book). He was shown multiple times over the course of season one, yet I have no fking idea what he's supposed to be like. 
 
Which leads us straight into the next point of criticism: the fact that the villain of the series was never characterized whatsoever. It is no secret that it's tough to hate a villain that you've never even seen do anything bad and of whom you've only seen a couple glimpses, which is why the most interesting villains are the ones that have a lot of presence like Yoshikage Kira (JoJo) or Handsome Jack (Borderlands 2). Hence it was rather confusing to see that the main villain of this series (who I THINK is the Black King... he's the only one who even came close to being one at least) was content with just sitting off-screen for the majority of the show, quietly minding his own business and who only did anything at the very end of season one... and even then, he didn't show up himself , but instead he sent an army of foot soldiers to deal with the army of the protagonists. IMO, that guy was one of the biggest failures of an antagonist I've ever seen, rivaling even the teacher from Boku dake ga inai machi. 
 
This lack of character development COULD'VE been fixed, had they just not thrown in some characters for one, maybe two episodes before never bringing them up again. Seriously, just take a look at the 'characters' page of this anime for yourself. It should be obvious that with such a huge cast, it's impossible to characterize each and every one of them to a satisfying extend, so why did they insist on introducing such a pile of them. For some of them, I don't even know what their role was supposed to be, because they were introduced as if they were gonna be important, literally did one thing and then fked off into nothingness. Prime example: Zero-pilot Kanno Naoshi. He SEEMED like he could've been a really interesting addition to the party, not only because he came from a much more modern era than the rest of the cast but also because he was one of the few people that actually had a character. Which is why his share of screentime still baffles me: he appeared, shot down a dragon, crashed with his plane... and literally the only time he appeared after that was a couple episodes later where he was shown having started living inside of the crashed plane. That was it. I'm still not sure whether he was supposed to be a more important character who just got cut or not. 
 
The next thing on the chopping block is the cliffhanger ending that this anime had. Because of my attempt to keep things spoiler-free, I'm not gonna go too in-depth, but here's what I will say: the first season of this anime basically ended with the protagonists and their army getting ready to defeat the Black King, but before literally anything of the sorts actually happened. I hate cliffhanger endings just as much as the next guy, so I am obviously pissed when an anime uses its main antagonist as the sequel-hook. However, seeing as how a 2nd season got confirmed right as the first one ended, I am willing to not see that point as harsh as I would normally. 
 
Next up, we've got the point where I almost dropped the anime outright. In episode 4, the protagonist's group, supported by the male elves they freed, march towards the castle in which the local bad guy had... basically kidnapped the female population of the elven village. They find out that the women had been locked into the castle's tower, and upon arriving there, they see that the guards of the castle had been repeatedly raping the elven women. Pretty much the ONLY reason why I didn't just drop the entire anime at that point (as my very personal opinion is that rape is the one thing that should never be happening) was because I was hoping that the guards would all be killed in the most visceral ways possible in the next episode (which only sorta happened). And before anyone jumps at me to say that 'it was obvious' and that 'it was a means of making you hate the bad guys', I would like to point towards an anime that handled a very similar situation (man kidnaps the female population of a settlement and locks them into the giant place he lives in) very differently and a lot 'better': Hitsugi no Chaika. In that show, it basically played out like this: the antagonist of that arc was a man whose 'hobby' was to slice up women and he was using the women he kidnapped as his 'test subjects'. It was a set-up that was still really effective at making you hate that guy, but it completely avoided making me hate the anime itself. So there you go, there was definitely an alternative way to handle the situation. 
 
Last up, there are two things I want to talk about about the archery in this anime. I am aware that these are, once again, points that might be completely irrelevant to you, but I still consider them important enough to include. 
Firstly: Fire arrows. Jesus fking Christ, when are people finally going to stop using fire arrows in their works if they have NO idea how they work?? If I got 5 cents every time somebody used them completely unrealistically, I could run my own 'Say NO to fire arrows' ad-campaign. In Drifters in particular, the fact that they were used this weirdly is even more interesting, as this anime tried to be realistic in its usage of weaponry. 
The first time fire arrows showed up in this anime, I was actually somewhat impressed to see that they were used in one of the only two situations where people DID actually use them in the middle ages: during a siege. Sure, the effectiveness of those arrows was still ridiculous (real fire arrows had a chance of ~2% to set something aflame, here it seemed more like 98%), but it was something at least. However, the second time they were used it was back to good ol' 'this is NOT how they work. This is not how ANYTHING works'. For some stupid reason, the makers of this thought that it was a reasonable idea to have people use fire arrows... during a horse chase. Which would've worked, were it not for two simple things... a) No and b) NO!... but seriously, that part was fking stupid. There was no way for the horse-riders to set their arrows on fire, which means that there was no way to even HAVE fire arrows in that situation... and using them while riding a horse also seems like the best way to get yourself killed, so yeah. Stupid on every single level, which, sadly, seems to be the norm for fire arrows in anything from anime to movies to games. (for further knowledge about fire arrows, watch this 'ere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTd_0FRAwOQ ) 
 
And secondly... Why in the name of god did the professional archer in this anime hold his bow sideways on multiple occasions?? Doing so is pretty much the most sure-fire way to show your enemy that you have NO idea what the fk you're doing, as you pretty much sacrifice a large portion of your range and power for nothing. Every time the archer-guy held his bow that way, I started to think whether I should laugh or cry about that... and settled for being pissed off. 
 
All in all: this anime was, all things considered, pretty fking bad in my opinion. My advice would be to just watch the Opening ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQYJxbkEItQ ) until you're sick of it (which might take a while, as it's really good) and just give the anime itself a miss. You'll do yourself a favor.

    This anime is extraordinary! 
 
Even when stacked up against Isekai abominations like Death March and Isekai wa Smartphone, it still somehow manages to be even worse! In fact, this might just be the worst Isekai anime that I’ve seen to date, and considering the generally poor quality of the genre, that’s really saying something. So yes, this anime (whatever the hell its name is) is definitely incredible! 
 
Incredibly bad. 
 
This anime doesn’t even bother to start with the protagonist getting inexplicably transported to a fantasy world. When we’re introduced to him, he’s already been in another world for two years, so it’s almost like this isn’t even an Isekai anime. Gotta love dat lazy writing! Anyway, our protagonist, named Super Ultra Omnipotent Usurper, or Suou for short, is, you guessed it, a perfect being in every way! He’s the most morally just and relatable character ever, is a military genius, and, most importantly, gets all the bitches! Actually, only the latter is true, but the anime still desperately tries to give him character traits that make him more than just a chick magnet. Too bad they fail miserably.  
 
Suou is a conqueror, plain and simple. Not of nations, but of women. Yet what makes him stand out from his fellow Kirito clones? Well, Suou is unique in that when he claims a girl as his property, he makes her a part of his “family.” Thats right, this guy forces his women to become his little sisters and daughters, and makes them address him as “papa” and “big brother.” What a sick bastard. He also doesn’t seem to give a crap about his soldiers and doesn’t bat an eye when they’re slaughtered in combat. And the best part is that the writers still try to portray him as an “I am holier than thou” type of character. What a guy! 
 
Thanks to the solar powered smartphone that Suou just so happens to have (Sigh…I don’t even care anymore), our hero is able to look up military tactics of great historical leaders like Alexander the Great and Sun Tzu and implement them in battles. Of course you really can’t tell what battle strategies are being used during fight scenes due to the hideous visuals that make everything look like an utter mess. There are even some scenes that are repeated several times within the same battle because the animators couldn’t be bothered to actually do their job.  
 
A random red haired dude in this anime wisely said “the details don’t matter.” I think the writers must have taken that sentence to heart. Nothing about this anime makes any sense. The plot thus far has gone nowhere, the characters are painfully bland and annoying, and the show isn’t fun to watch. And if you’re watching this for the sole purpose of beating your meat to sexy 2D anime waifus, don’t. It just isn’t worth it.

    Everyone should admit it: we've all got our own tastes.  Instead of vainly trying to ignore these tastes, it's really best to acknowledge them.  And here I do so: I have my own tastes.  Why bring this up?  Because I'm about to make a rather bold claim. 
 
Lucky Draw Triangle ~Miharu After~ has the sexiest pair of hentai heroines I've EVER seen, and it has some of the sexiest sex I've EVER seen.  On top of that, there's not really any rape or lolicon, which makes me totally comfortable with it.  This should be my favorite hentai ever. 
 
And yet, despite this, I can't bring myself to think of Lucky Draw Triangle as a masterpiece.  Why?  Because of Nameless Male Protagonist #38567049.  He has two impossibly attractive girls lusting insatiably after him, all because...um...he is a master of the art of inconspicuousness?  Sure, he's moderately attractive-looking, but I can't forget this one scene where Futaba comments on NMP#38567049's wonderful facial expressions during sex, and HE LOOKS LIKE HE JUST DIED FIVE MINUTES AGO.  In fact, he pretty much acts as if he were dead.  As in, he basically doesn't act.  He seems to be the definition of a human sex toy, except capable of occasional banal dialogue.  As much as I love Miharu and Futaba, I feel a bit uncomfortable watching them lust after what is essentially an inanimate object. 
 
Yes, if only NMP#whatever had a personality, I could love LDT~MA~ with all my heart and gonads.  But, alas, I cannot.  And, on that sad, depressing note, I move forward to the break-down: 
 
Story (6/10): 
Girl likes guy.  Guy likes girl.  Girl gets amnesia.  Guy wants to cure amnesia.  Girl's sister puts the moves on guy.  Girl gets the moves put on her by guy.  LOTS AND LOTS OF HAPPY, SUPER-SEXY SEX. 
 
That is all.  Seriously, it doesn't matter much, as LDT~MA~ is just a sex-fest.  A glorious, consensual sexfest.  If you're trying to watch hentai purely for engaging, complex stories, you've obviously made some sort of horrific reasoning error.  As far as the story goes, it is solid but far from extraordinary.  At least it doesn't NOT make sense, right?  Although, really, in real life amnesia doesn't quite work the way it does in LDT~MA~, but since when has amnesia EVER been given a realistic treatment in anime?  That's a rhetorical question; I'm sure it has been done at least once. 
 
Art (10/10): 
Oh dear lord, PoRo (the production studio) knows how to make me happy.  Sharp lines, bright colors, designs that are slightly modest in the grand scheme of hentai.  Animation is fluid, oh so sexfully fluid, and the seximatography is wonderful and pretty darn hardcore.  Lots of positions, fluid animation, arching, wiggling, throes of passion, and it's all vanilla sex.  My god, this is my hentai nirvana, as poor a combination of words as that phrase is.  Words just cannot describe what I think of Miharu, the sex scenes, and Futaba (in that order), which perhaps explains why I am failing so hardcore at this review.  To round out the art section, the backgrounds are colorful but pretty darn boring, BUT WHO CARES LOOK AT THE HOT ANIME GIRLS!!!  Seriously. 
 
Sound (9/10): 
In all honesty, I was too busy looking at the HOT ANIME GIRLS to pay attention to anything but the sex SFX (read: BGM? What BGM?), which were juicy and wonderful, as were the moans.  But I find this to be typical of hentai.  Oh, and Futaba talks a LOT during sex.  It's kinda weird, since our Nameless Male Protagonist says nothing.  It's awkward cause it's hard to remember that he's just the most realistic sex toy ever.  Oh, and female voices are a bit on the high-pitched side, but any watcher of moe-ish hentai will probably be used to that by now. 
 
Character (7/10): 
Miharu is our main female lead, and she's amazing.  Sexually liberated, playful, not really shy; a huge contrast to her amnesiac self and most other romance heroines (hentai or otherwise).  I think she'd be a fun character even outside of hentai. 
Futaba is Miharu's sister and rival in love and...well...kinda selfish and manipulative.  Not very much so, but it's hard to get a reading on her. 
NMP#huh is NMP#huh (his name may be Ushio in this anime).  He is spectacularly bad, even for a Nameless Male Protagonist.  Not only does he basically not exist most of the time, but also when he DOES exist, he cheats on his girlfriend and later sorta forces her into sex.  No one is really unhappy during any of this, but it's still a bit unsettling.  If this were a more serious show, I'd kinda expect Miharu to be seriously psychologically screwed up even when she recovers her memories.  And for that there would be no forgiveness, since Miharu is a little sexy ball of sexy awesomeness.  Sexy.  Yay. 
 
 
 
 
OVERALL (9/10): 
It's easy to see that I love this hentai far more than it deserves.  That's because I think it is hot beyond all belief as well as not disturbing for the most part.  In light of that, I generally forgive it for its flaws, which are many in the writing department.  Oh well; this will simply go down in my books as legendarily sexy.  The only thing in my opinion that is comparably sexy to LDC~MA~ is After Class Lesson (with its also-super-sexy Akari Mizuno), but After Class Lesson is also a bit disturbing and/or uncomfortable. 
 
This could all change if PoRo manages to somehow engineer a RAGE ending, or to totally screw over Miharu (Miharu in the act of screwing is GREAT; screwing over Miharu is DOUBLEPLUS UNGOOD).

    Since there were no reviews for this anime, I decided to write it. 
This is my first time writing a review, and English is my second language, don’t expect much from this. 
 
***For people who have not seen “Tesagure Bukatsumono” 
 
I’m pretty sure more than 80 percent of the people will look at the title, and think “WTF is this?”  
 
This is the spin-off of “Tesagure Bukatsumono” series. Tesagure means “find it by your hands”, and bukatsu is extracurricular activities. The word mono after that is just to make the word bukatsu look cooler, so forget about that. It’s not the disease. This Anime just talks about “What ifs” for extracurricular activities every episode.  
 
 
Before you guys watch this, there are couple things you should know. First off, this is an anime where the voice actresses fool around, and make you laugh. And was all put into an anime afterwards. Half of what they’re talking about are nonsense girl’s talk, which are adlibs.  
 
Since the girls are talking one after another, sometimes they overlap and conflict with other people. Due to that reason, the subtitles doesn’t tell you everything. So if you want to really enjoy this, I would study Japanese and their culture. And what I mean by their culture, the jokes they make sometimes will be things that are popular in Japan right now, and they try to make a parody out of it. 
 
 
 
 
The animation style has horrible computer graphics, since the animation is not important. 
 
 
Oh, you should watch Tesagure Bukatsumono first season, since it’s shorter in length with 11 miutes, when this spin-off is 24 minutes long. (Wow I can’t believe the spin-off is longer than the original.) And then, think over if this anime is good enough to take your time. 
 
 
***For people who have seen “Tesagure Bukatsumono” 
 
They added 5 more characters of adaption from a nonpopular manga series.  
And this time, they don’t talk about extracurricular activities, but tries new things. Some are really hilarious like when they play the werewolf game, which is popular in Japan. 
 
They added: 
Mikami, Shiori (Yuruyuri: Akari, Attack on Titan: Krista Lenz) 
Takamori, Natsumi (Sakurasou:Kamiigusa Misaki, Another:Misaki Mei) wow misakis 
Ookubo, Rumi (Acchi Kocchi:Tsumiki, Yuruyuri:Chinatsu) 
Uesaka, Sumire (Chuunibyou:Dekomori, The idolmaster Cinderella girls:Anastasia) 
Komatsu, Mikako (Teenage romance comedy SNAFU: Totsuka, Nisekoi:Tsugumi Seishirou). 
 
Its not the same as the series before, but it is still good, that I looked forward to it every week. 
 
But just telling you guys, the story in the end of each episode is not good, so you can skip those.

    This show was something special. It even me me want to run. 
Story 10 -- The story was overall pretty predictable, but it was executed so well. The stakes were always clear and I cared about it because the characters cared about it. I think this story finally had an interesting take on the classic sports anime question of nature v nurture or more specifically natural talent v practice. This and Ping Pong are the only shows I can think of that actually engage with that idea in a satisfying and interesting way. The story fulfills all the goals it sets out to at the beginning and completes them all well. Luckily, this show doesn't feel the need to take an episode to solve every single problem it introduces like Yuki's home situation and King's job hunt. Both of these problems are dealt with to different degrees, but the solution is brief and in King's case off-screen, providing time to work with the most important story elements. This is apparently characteristic of Shion Miura who also authored ""The Great Passage,"" but the adaptation is also to be praised for putting the story into this format. 
Art 8 -- This show lived in its backgrounds. The beautiful vistas really sold the appeal of running every time they showed up. That said, the animation itself was generally excellent considering the monotonous kinds of movements the characters were producing. There were a few moments of awesome character movement which really paid off emotionally and visually like Haiji's biking scene at the very beginning of the show. The character designs were awesome and expressive, showing exactly who the characters were before they delivered any lines. I believe that the character designer Takahiro Chiba was influenced quite heavily by his work as animation director on both ""Haikyuu!!"" and ""Welcome to the Ballroom"" which also have great character designs. The only reason this category is losing points is because of some strange animation errors in the last third of the show. I remember in particular Musa going far off model for a good part of Ep. 20. 
Sound 10 -- The music being excellent should be no surprise considering Yuuki Hayashi's previous work, including works like ""Kiznaiver,"" ""Death Parade,"" and the ""My Hero Academia"" franchise. The score did everything it needed to and helped the payoffs hit even harder. The voice acting throughout was excellent. Ootsuka Takeo led the cast as Kakeru and provided an amazing performance which developed with the character in beautiful form. Worth noting is the fact that Ootsuka is nearly brand new to the VA industry and it is not noticeable in the least. Another interesting fact that I never realized while watching is that the seiyuus for Jota and Joji are two people, Enoki Junya and Uemura Yuuto respectively, but I couldn't tell them apart.  
Character 10 -- The characters were the story and since the story was strong, so were they. A good percentage of this show was a character study and each of the cast was fleshed out a great deal and were realistic, grounded people. The whole cast had real motivations that fed directly into their actions and this agreement of ideas really helped both parties. The attention to making characters real came out in spades with Sakaki. He was a very difficult to like character for the entirety of the series, but even though I didn't want to see him succeed, I understood why he was the pain the neck he was. Finally, these characters interacted so well. They were thrown into different kinds of situations and every time they related in a way that was true to themselves and was entertaining to watch. I especially loved how the character dynamics changed as the series progressed. The best example of this is Kurahara and Prince's relationship. Watching their first interactions v their final episodes is night and day. All that said, Nira is such a good girl and her midcards give me life. 
Enjoyment 10 -- This show worked for me in every way. All the things it promised at the beginning of the show were delivered and I was always invested in whatever my boys were doing. The show knew how to deliver a payoff and while the journey matters more than the destination, the destination was pretty darn beautiful as well. 
Overall 10 -- I cannot recommend this show enough. The only reason I would steer you away is if you have a hard time empathizing with animated characters as this show is never about the spectacle, but the people who are part of it. This came from a director(Kazuya Nomura) with few things I like and a script writer(Kohei Kiyasu) who is new to the market, but they pulled together a story that I loved for every second.

    As I saw the synopsis on a random anime thing on a certain website, I thought, ""This is going to be a seinen anime where a thief goes and steals things, and the police are going to try to find him, like Death Note."" Boy was I wrong. 
 
Story: 4/10 
 
Here is an anime that is 95% shounen/harem/ecchi about three perverts trying to trying to do what perverts in anime usually want to do, and 5% shounen/action with a fairly uninteresting plot. 
 
Art: 6/10 
 
For a 2003 anime, the art was decent, the action scenes okay, and there was no use of CGI. (though why would there be CGI in a 2003 anime?) 
 
Characters: 3/10 
 
The characters went in through the anime without changing at all. The harem members were the exact same, all perverts. The main character was your average shounen/harem protagonist. 
 
Enjoyment: 3/10 
 
At least it was only 2 hours, and not the usual 4 (half-length episodes), else I wouldn't have survived this anime.

Story/art 
There are two main male characters portrayed in this anime. First one doesn't connect fully with main female character. Thus the idea of starting the show in a passer-by fashion rather than a narration makes sense. Even though at first glance the art seems a tad copy and pasted to start. 
 
Plot, through a somewhat non-direct comedy level depicts bizarre parings in a truthful comical fashion. A normal paring for example would be a student with student. 
 
Conclusion was not what i wanted but at the same time fitting. If you are looking for ecchi this is more of a tease if anything. If you are for a comedy approach you won't be disappointed. The typed words at the end not only referenced title(which was appropriate) but you get the sense even the writer questions the reasoning for the ending. Which by itself is amusing. 
 
Censorship here is strange like the anime's name. Sometimes it is blatant with a sticker but in other times it will go with the heavy darkened approached but allow non sexual organs like a strap-on to be somewhat visible. 
 
P.s. 
Cover-shot image is a marketing sell. Yes, its from the movie but not how one might think it fits in. Although, while paring is somewhat untrue the story's underlining message of strange love is best portrayed with an image like that. Even though it is lying to the viewers it tells the truth.

    D.N Angel is about an ordinary boy, named Daisuke Niwa who has a family secret: when a boy in the Niwa family turns 14, he\'s prone to turning into phantom thief Dark. The only way to turn into this phantom thief is to think about the girl that he has strong feelings for. At this point in time, it\'s a girl named Risa. 
 
Dark has an alternate named Krad, who is represented as angel, which is like \&quot;light\&quot;, and they\'re constantly at war with each other, but the reality is they both have to be conjoined together. 
 
D.N angel is such a cute anime to watch, Daisuke is the main character and he is so genuine, sweet, and caring, you just have to go \&quot;Daisuke!!\&quot; Dark is completely different from Daisuke, and the adventures that they have together are crazy and so intoxicating, and on the other hand Risa and her twin sister Riku, are both friends with Daisuke, and at the same time, don\'t know that he is also the phantom thief that the police are trying to capture!

    Amazing. They did an awesome job with this anime considering the manga wasn't that far in and a lot of the story differs. It's still very likely for that world, and suits the characters. 
 
The entire cast of FMA characters are extremely well developed and the world in which it is set is extremely intriguing with a great history. The themes and ideas that are explored are extremely deep and dark but are pulled off well. 
 
Without following the manga, this is still an awesome series.

    It is said by many (Livejournal users), that everyone has a story inside them just waiting to be told.  
 
Many action adventures rely solely on plot, letting the characterisation come second; inversely, many romances have virtually no plot to speak of, letting character interaction and reflection drive along the drama - while historical chronicles often rely on the setting and the carefully researched daily-living conditions of the characters to paint a rich saga of that time and place.  
 
Baccano! - Italian for 'ruckus' - is a blend of all these genres, and yet, it fits none of them. 
 
The 2007 anime, produced by Brain's Base (Spice and Wolf II, Kuragehime) and based on a series of light novels, is something of an enigma. It is simultaneously infamous for its popularity and unpopularity, recieving nothing but praise from foreign fans and nothing but apathy from Japanese ones.  
 
A possible reason for this is that it doesn't feel like an anime. 
 
To be clearer, this feels solidly American, from the jazzy soundtrack to the character designs, from the trains to the accents (in the dub, at least). As a Western viewer, even if not as an American, this feels instantly relatable. 
 
Of course, it helps that we get thrown straight into the action.  
 
Speaking of, the first episode is something of a decoy. We immediately get two characters discussing a story who are never to be seen again (outside of the OVAs, anyway, Karyll~) and then a clusterfuck of spoilers for the next 13 episodes. Is that girl crawling up the train the rail tracer? Did that guy just lose his arm? Did someone just kill a kid? Did his fingers just..? It's messy, it's bloody, it's confusing.  
 
It is hard to be original and compelling without being a mindfuck, but despite the fantasy element, Baccano! feels thoroughly grounded in reality. Perhaps it's the realistic setting; perhaps it's because the characters act so much like we would. Capturing the surprise we felt as children, watching the idle sketches in the corner of your notepad suddenly gain life as we flipped through, and audacious, like robbing a train for explosives with only your boyfriend and your two friends by your side. 
 
After the first episode the story is a non-stop ride on the Flying Pussyfoot (if you need a minute to laugh that off, take it now), along Eve's search for her missing brother (who everyone hates), the clashing of the Gandors and Runorata families in what must be the longest cardgame in history, and the quest to recreate an immortality elixir, the panacea, the ultimate goal of the alchemist. The story slips in and out among the different times with graceful ease, and a title card with the year appears for a second as a transition. Tension is continually built and smaller revelations continue to break as we see other character's points of view on different incidents, overlapping, building up and foreshadowing.  
 
Despite the seismometer of a plotline and the lack of clear protagonist, characterisation is never sacrificed. Characterisation comes first in this series, as everyone has their past and their reasons even if they aren't immediately apparent. Why does a crybaby like Jacuzzi have such a large tattoo on his face? Why is Chane so silent? A woman in a suit, in the thirties? And where the hell did Firo get such a snazzy hat?  
 
The period setting is gloriously rendered, yet, it is not a setting that the series gloats about. There are hardly any scenes that pull back and focus on the environment as a pat on the back for all the research and effort put into recreating it. Though the series is very obviously set in the 1930s, we see it through the characters' eyes as their present - pressing, urgent, real.  
 
I mentioned romance before, and, without giving too much away, the affectivity of the characters throughout all this constant turmoil is never sacrificed. Firm friendships are made from chance meetings and several canon romances appear, each one uniquely forming in ways that tug upon the heartstrings and ultimately feel very real.  
 
Of course, I can't talk about the validity of this series without touching upon the English dub, produced by Aniplex. This is a dub that has been ranted and raved about in anime circles, and as someone who watched sub first and who genuinely prefers Japanese dubs to English ones, I was very prepared not to like it. 
 
While the Japanese dub certainly isn't bad, the addition of accents and slang added so much to the characterisation and atmosphere that it was almost like the difference between 720p and Bluray HD: like watching a slightly better, sharper series.  
 
However, this dub is no means perfect: the generic cute voice that sounds so natural in Japanese dubs came off slightly annoying with Maria (a general complaint of all English dubs, not this one in particular nor the voice actress herself), and the fact a few epic lines of Ladd's were changed. 'Thank you, fuck you, a villain has arrived' is one of my favourite things to say when entering a room, and its omission irked me a little bit - if memory serves, some other lines were changed, but it wasn't so obvious in their cases. However, I think this is a small price to pay for such perfect synching of, for a lack of a better term, the lip flaps. They were absolutely perfect, throughout it was hard to believe the animation wasn't made to fit this very dub.  
 
The soundtrack, too, is absolutely top-notch. The OP is plain addictive, and while the ED is rather dull in comparison, it does grow on you. The OST throughout the series always adds to the scene and atmosphere, never feeling out of place. 
 
The art in this series seems rather dark at first glance. There is not much use of bright colour in the series, but there is a deep saturation like the smog that clings to a city and fits the general air of the 1930s well. The character designs are on the realistic side and though many of the older, blonde men look alike, most characters have distinctive visual traits that set them apart and make it easier for the viewer.  
 
The characters themselves are all enjoyable in their own way (except Dallas). Isaac and Miria are contenders for the most well loved character duo of all time, the most incompetant thieves ever, who spread happiness inadvertantly wherever they go. Isaac rather looks like Andy from Cowboy Bebop, don't you think? Other than Isaac and Miria, there is perpetually closed-eyed Maiza, estrogen brigade bait Firo, stoic Chane, surprisingly bishounen Luck Gandor, a guy who eats birdfood, an explosion fetishist, delicious shota, the Rail Tracer and enough psychopaths to keep you chugging along until anime does some sort of answer to Girl, Interrupted.    
 
I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys piecing together a very satisfying plot or anyone who enjoys a cast of diverse and interesting characters. This is not a story for someone who wants to switch their brain off; nor is it for anyone with an aversion to animated blood or gore.  
 
This review is about the story that is Baccano! It is a story can never really end. Why? Because it's enjoyable, of course.

    I think I have been too harsh whenever I said that I’m not interested in any form of media that is close to an RPG or has Middle Earth elements but that statement still stand by me because there’s nothing remotely interesting about that genre, aside from most Final Fantasy games (I’m not sure about the other media with the Final Fantasy name) but I’m mostly willing to give one of them a shot especially with this particular title, which has recommended (sort of) from a fellow reviewer I know. 
 
Pacifica Casull is the most feared and hated person by the followers of the God Mauser. Known as the Scrapped Princess, she is the poison that will destroy the world. To avoid being killed by the zealots of Mauser, Pacifica and her adoptive brother and sister leave the village of Manhurin. Her brother, Shannon, is an expert with the sword while Racquel is proficient with magic. At every step of the way, however, someone is constantly trying to kill Pacifica, hoping to somehow avert the catastrophe that is supposed to befall the world on her 16th birthday. 
 
 
I will admit that I like the plotline for this title as it deals with a burden of being born with a curse and that you have to live with that of people constantly hating you for what you are because of your title yet once you know them, they are not that bad of a person that they make you out to be. Plus, the show is run of a quick and constant pace as it doesn’t feel too long whenever you watch it, as in watching the first 6 episodes is 2 hours long but you don’t think that it’s dragging or wasting your time. 
 
I got to say for the characters, there is one flaw within the characters of the show: NONE OF THEM ARE UNLIKABLE! As in, I find every character of the show to be enjoyable to watch once you get to know them in the story. In the beginning, the main character Pacifica Cassul may act like a brat in some of the episodes but you don’t really hate her since it wasn’t that obnoxious or overbearing. You really feel for the character that’s going through his status as the Scrapped Princess, being forsaken to that, and it helps that she can be a sweet person on the inside. Shannon Cassul is the straightforward older brother, meaning he doesn’t have time to fool around when it comes to protecting his sister and is a great swordfighter.  Raquel is the oldest of the siblings and she is very calm and motherly figure of the show, which is what I liked about her as in groups, people do need that type of person who assures themselves that things can work out. Other characters include Leo, the noble yet naïve knight who vows to protect Pacifica, and also has a crush on her, too, and Winia, the introverted and lonesome maid who later joined the Cassul siblings into their adventure. 
 
The animation from Studio BONES is very 2000s vintage considering as of now, it’s been almost 10 years since its creation in 2003 and it doesn’t look aged at all but the artwork, character designs and backgrounds are very fluid and strikingly impressive by today’s standards or even the standards of 6 years ago. 
 
Musically, I can say for the opening theme, it seems like a bit of Scottish and/or medieval charm was heavily influenced by that, as well as the background music. The ending music, I didn’t feel much of that influence on there but it is serviceable for the ending theme. 
 
Lastly, I got to say on the Bandai/Bang Zoom dub is that this is one of the most well-done dubs I have ever watched. It also helps that Crispin Freeman, not only voices Shannon, but he is also the ADR director and writer of the show and it shows that Freeman can be awesome behind the screen as well as being the voice. Kari Wahlgren as Pacifica is one of her better roles of likable characters, right next to Haruko from FLCL and Saya from Blood+ and Bridget Hoffman does a great and nuanced job as always playing the cool and calm role of Raquel and even supporting roles filled by Michelle Ruff, Yuri Lowenthal, and Kirk Thornton among others are decent in their roles. 
 
FINAL VERDICT: I can easily say that Scrapped Princess is one of those shows that you should definitely check out (if you can, since you-know-who has folded). It has a great amount of pacing, enjoyable characters with great development and something that can combine things you don’t even like in anime into saying you love.

    I went into The World God Only Knows because of the recommendation of a friend who considered it one of the best anime/manga out there. Just 1 season of the anime into it, and I already find it hard to disagree with this. So right now, I feel like doing all I can to tell people why I consider it an amazing anime that you should totally check out. 
 
The story of this anime is about a handsome nerd named Keima, who has a sense of superiority over humanity because he understands the fictional girls in his dating sims. However, because he has considered himself a master of conquering these fictional girls, the underworld decides that he can do the same in real life. So a cute demon girl name Elsie shows up to reveal that he must capture spirits that have trapped themselves in the bodies of different girls. In order to avoid death for both of them, he must now win the hearts of these girls and kiss them so that Elsie can capture these lost spirits. And this begins what I can only describe as a unique twist on the usual ""____ of the week"" type of story. While not literally every week, Keima continues to find girls he has to have fall for him for the sake of his life. These girls range from a supposed rich girl to a pink haired pop idol, each with their own distinct personalities. 
 
The main thing that shocked me was how much I really cared about these girls, especially the ones given the most focus. Now Elsie is more the sweet fake sister of Keima instead of a love interest but she might be my favorite. Her main purpose seems to be the naive, cute girl who learns about Keima and the human world. And despite that not being the most deep or creative character (at least in theory), it all seemed more genuine than most attempts at a similar character, and she genuinely put a smile on my face when she was on screen, especially because of her endearing actions throughout this part of this series. 
 
There is also Kanon and Shiori. Kanon is a pop idol teen who is increasingly annoyed at Keima's apathy towards her and her performing and Shiori is (to an almost absurd degree) a shy girl who loves reading above all else. Both have fairly similar yet different arcs that involve them overcoming their insecurities, one involving a need for attention, and one coming from a fear or inability to speak out against anything. In both cases, Keima eventually figures out a plan based on what he knows of girls in games in order to slowly but surely get these girls to fall for them. However, he seems to slowly gain some respect for real life girls through these events and while his guesses are shockingly accurate, the girls tend to surprise him despite that. It seems like the series is trying to say a lot of things about stereotyping and assuming things about people and about nerds. One thing I've at least gotten out of it is how many elements of the story could be considered sexist and yet it never feels that way. The series seems more than self-aware enough so that it avoids this being about how a guy can conquer women and is more about a guy discovering things about the world while also using his incredible nerd knowledge to help teenager girls' insecurities. It seems to be on this impressive line that most writers wouldn't be able to stay on and its intelligence is one of the things that elevates it to greatness. Despite being based on the cliche of a teenage girl who is also a pop idol, I found Kanon's story to be the most believable. Just the idea of a famous teenage girl so desperate to always be the center of attention is very sad and real to me based on how real life celebrities can end up like. Shiori's was arguably the most over-the-top and silly but her character I also found the most sympathetic. I'm already sympathetic to this type of character but it being written as well as it was made it even more so. 
 
It is really astounding how much I cared about these characters. Like more than I usually expect, even from a lot of great anime. But unlike many anime I've seen in recent years where it had to be overly depressing for that to happen, this series is uplifting and always ends with a happy ending that genuinely makes you feel glad you watched it. It's the type of thing I wish a lot of fiction understood about emotion. And while the serious stuff is great, the other thing that makes this such a joy to watch is the comedy. This series made me laugh pretty hard a few times, and I was consistently laughing throughout the series, which is really rare. I'm kinda interested in how these scenes were in the manga, because transitioning comedy from one medium to another seems like a difficult process to get down. But this one makes that look effortless, because the timing is brilliant in this series. They always know, when to start a joke, when to end it and how long to keep it going. There's just enough obvious ones or built up jokes along with stuff that is random enough that it makes you laugh but not random enough (or too frequently random) that it gets old like certain wacky series. The shocking amount of western pop culture references were also great. Elsie in particular got a lot of laughs from me, which is a big reason why she's my favorite character right now. And this comedy is what helps make the sad and dramatic stuff even better, because you get this sense of likability and fun from the comedy so that you care when sad stuff happens. It is so simple, yet so great. 
 
The art and animation are both really solid. They're nothing you're gonna praise as brilliant like I just did for the rest of this, but it does what it needs to do and does it quite well and that's basically all I ask for. It's nice, colorful, didn't have any mistakes I noticed, was animated decently, was fun to watch as an animated series. It's cool. The music though is great. The composer of the background music has done mostly work in JRPGs and similar titles and you can tell. There's this one scene in particular that tries to make how many different types of books there are into this grand, epic, emotional scene and it works because the music is epic in all the right ways. And that's fairly consistent with the series, just great compositions all around. The Opening too (Ending's pretty good too). It starts out as a fairly typical but extremely well done J-Pop song but then turns into this more holy sounding (only way I can describe it) mixed with I think hints of auto-tune, which is perfect for a series about a game nerd God like the protagonist in this series. Just love that. Voice acting is great too. Pretty every performance is as believable and fun as it needs to be. 
 
If I had one very minor complaint, is that the last episode of the first season didn't feel amazing enough for the series it was in. It was still really good and there are more seasons so whatever, but it could've ended that a bit better I feel... 
 
So I genuinely love this series and I can assume that it stays as good in the sequel seasons or the manga. It is pretty much a masterpiece and if I can, I'd like as many people as possible to give it a chance.

    I watched this show right after Chaos head and given that they go together (or are supposed to in some respect) I wasnt expecting much if anything. However once I got into the show, I saw that it was going to be drastically different from chaos head and was on a level of its own, very much deserving of the high rankings it has recieved. Without further ado, my review. 
 
The story is one that never fails to intrigue people, as it follows a group of friends as they manage to build a time machine. This is almost certain to draw people in as we all have thought about what we would do given the opportunity to time travel. These guys however dont aim for the grandure or almost impossible goals that many would if they were given the chance to alter their pasts. This follows the group as they live out a span that is around 3 weeks in time, but since it is about time travel, alot more happens in these 3 weeks than would normally. 
Something that as a viewer you should be aware of is that the show does start slowly(at least in my opinion), and about halfway through the overall prgression just halts, but as ive stated, this is mainly due in part to the time traveling.  
The characters were so... bland, at least at first to me. I say this because they dont really seem to have very much personality, but quite quickly my view of this was able to change(even though, im not quite sure when). The main character is okabe rinturo and he fancies himself a mad scientist and while thats all well and good, the whole schtick that he was working with got stale rather quickly, but once they quit cramming the idea down our throats I liked him far more. Aside from him you have the perky friend who is a girl but not a girlfriend, a second scientist, a steriotypical computer geek, and humorously enough a rather beautiful character (who is a dude). 
As far as my enjoyment goes, it was in following the plots that they cook up in order to try and revert the changed world that they had created back to the world that it had previously been. Whats more, these characters who I initially pegged as emotionally shallow quickly turn into very expressive induviduals which I was very happy to see. Finally I will say this: even though Steins Gate didnt impress me at first, it obviously turned me around so much that I cant stop kissing its perverbial ass now, which more than justifies the high praise that Steins Gate has earned!

    Life, Death, Fate, Destiny, and Penguin Drum? Mawaru is one of those anime that has a interesting premise and emotional setting but is ruined by it's own insecurity. First thing you'll notice about Mawaru Penguindrim is the art design which is beautifully saturated in vigorous colors noticed from episode one and stays consistent throughout. Characters morph different facial expressions which changes up the consistency for the viewer. 
 
(Read the synopsis for a summary) 
As for the story, the first episodes of the anime caught my attention but quickly went on a decline, especially when following Ringo's story line and even more so when certain scenes when the art turned into 2D and borders came up (you'll know what i mean when you see it). But the second half of the anime began to really pick up and backstories for certain characters were revealed putting in some needed plot elements. 
 
Ahhh the characters we have the tough guy older brother, whimpy younger brother, innocent younger sister, possessed penguin hat, overly attached girlfriend, and a couple extras characters i can't talk about without spoiling it. There's a great importance on the role of family and is shown every episode signifying the relations of our 3 main characters and there interactions with one another; actually is quite touching at some points. But nothing too memorable in the end.  
 
This is were the anime really falls apart. The themes are about big and serious topics like fate and death, but the anime never takes itself seriously .... like ever. Anytime a serious scene comes up, it shows these invisible penguins f***ing around killing bugs or eating a lot. LIKE SOMEONE WILL BE DYING AND THIS WILL HAPPEN. It's really hard to take these moments for granted at times and dramatically takes away the tension which the show is in need of. 
 
A very big positive is there's a decent amount of symbolism in the show and even takes some biblical symbolic ideals and stories. The cool thing is some of the message are very easy to recognize, while others are discreetly slipped in there. Noticing these connections gave me slight joy in finding them and gave me more of an appreciation of the conveying message. 
 
The ending without spoiling anything was meh and of course overlays an occurring theme presented throughout the show. Overall the anime is not horrible by any means but is cringe worthy at some moments and very boring in others, but makes up for it in art design, interesting back stories, and strong themes. SURVIVAL TACTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wa Minai went under the radar for many anime watchers due to the hype for shows such as Goblin Slayer and Sword Art Online: Alicization, but it is undoubtedly one of the best shows currently airing. 
 
Romantic comedies are rarely known for having good plots or characters, especially in anime where we are commonly given a dense main protagonist and a harem to back him up. Development is almost non-existence  and the only thing that is possibly keeping the watcher going is the cute character designs. 
 
So what makes this show different from the rest? Granted this show is not exactly unique in any way but it definitely is very different, and I’ll explain why. 
 
Story: In this show we are given a main protagonist, Sakuta Azusagawa, who helps people that are suffering from what’s known as “Adolescence Syndrome”. Adolescence Syndrome, as stated by the name, occurs in those in their adolescent stage of life and are inflicted when they experience great stress, instability, and turmoil. The show uses the Adolescence Syndrome as a way to address common problems faced by many high school students, many that you may consider relatable. But in reality, many choose to hide their problems rather than express them to others in order to solve them. In this show, those who suffer from great stress are inflicted with physical damage, in which the character is in a way forced to understand how they must solve their problems, otherwise they are unable to face society again.  
This sort of plot is definitely a leg up from many other cliche stories. Although only 4 episodes have released, it can be predicted Sakuta will be helping out different characters overtime, curing them of Adolescence Syndrome while developing himself as he learns about the problems many of his peers face. This is a very similar style of plot to Oregairu, TWOGK, and Kokoro Connect. But just like those shows, this show may become a repetitive repeat in which Sakuta finds someone with Adolescence Syndrome and cures them of it, unless it tries to gradually increase the severity of this disease. 
 
Characters: Unarguably this show is highly focused on the characters that are being introduced. These characters are unique, as each one depicts a specific problem commonly faced throughout high school. Sakuta will learn of each problem and help each character out, while slowly developing himself. This is very similar to the characters of the shows aforementioned. But although the first 4 episodes of this show were quite good as well as the development of the characters, this show can easily fall and never be able to rise back to the top. As a show that is highly focused on the character, each time an arc ends, Sakuta and every new character introduced as well as the old ones must have a proper development. If only Sakuta gains development throughout the series, the other characters will become completely useless and we will be forced into an infinite story loop that will eventually cause the audience to lose interest. If, however, this loop does not occur, then get ready for one of the best romantic comedies to ever release in the anime universe. 
 
Art and Sound: If you have seen my previous reviews, I do not take art as an important factor that determines how good a show is. Rather, I focus on the plot and characters, as I see art as a benefit rather than a requirement. However, this show’s art is still great. The designs of the characters are quite simple, and you can feel as if you yourself are in the high school experience.  
When it comes to Romantic Comedies, music isn’t exactly a popular factor. The music is quite good though, especially the ending in my opinion. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall Rating: Overall this show has some of the greatest potential in this season. It is nice to see something different for a change, a drama that is well executed and a romantic comedy that does not focus on a dense main character, harem cast, and a selective comedic stance as well as large amounts of ecchi. However, this plot is nothing new, as we have commonly seen it in the past, especially from Oregairu, which has similar characters and a similar style of plot. If the next episodes are done well, we can have a great anime that addresses multiple and common challenges faced by high schoolers in reality, relatable and entertaining characters, and an almost unforgettable story. But if the character development fails, then this show will end up as a repetitive collection if predictable stories that is only entertaining at the beginning and progressively bores the audience into dropping the show. I have high hopes for this show’s success.

    Intro: 
 
I first learned about Eureka Seven when I saw Eureka on the cover of a magazine back in 2006 or so. She was very intriguing, and the series looked interesting, but I wasn't much of an anime watcher back then, so I didn't watch the series. Eureka has always been stuck in my head though, so now that I watch anime as a hobby, I figured I'd give the series a go, even though I don't generally like mecha-related series.  
 
First Impression: 4/10 
 
After the first couple of episodes, I really didn't see a reason for so many people giving this anime a 10. Renton acted like Naruto (Who I've never really liked), but somehow more annoyingly. Eureka quite emotionless and frankly much more boring than I'd hoped. The beginning of the series gets no more than a 4/10 from me.  
 
Story: 8/10 
 
The story in the first 25-30 episodes is something close to non-existent. It was mainly time for character development, which gave some story, but what was there had little to do with the story that shows up in the last 20 or so episodes. You don't get answers to much of anything until 90% of the character development is done. The character development is not mixed in with the story, which makes both seem a little less realistic. If they had mixed the two, the anime could have been shortened to 30-40 episodes and become much more enjoyable. The story that does show up at the end though, is a very good one, and is pulled off very well. It doesn't seem rushed, and doesn't seem dragged out, things make sense, and you think you know what's going on, but there are surprises at every turn. So, my score of 8/10 for story can be further explained with a 3/10 for the first half of the series, and a 10/10 for the second half. If you're willing to sit through 30 episodes of mediocre story, the last 20 episodes are worth it. Though some things are never explained, I didn't really feel like they were important to know. 
 
Art: 8/10  
 
The anime almost seems to be divided in two by every category, actually. In the first half the art was decent, but not great. Many backgrounds lacked the detail I've come to expect from Japanese animation and the animation itself didn't wasn't that great. The second half, however, improved in both these areas, and many scenes were just gorgeous. The fact that the characters always looked very well drawn was always the same, though. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
 
I'm never really a fan of opening/ending songs, and this was no different. The only song I sort of liked was the last opening song. The songs did fit with the tone of the anime though, so much of my opinion on them is simply that, an opinion. There didn't seem to be anything different about the songs. They were your typical opening/ending Japanese pop songs, and were sort of pointless to me.  
 
The background music was simply wonderful though. It matched the scenes and mood 99% of the time, and increased the effect of whatever is shown on the screen. If I left out my opinion on the opening/ending songs, sound would have gotten a 9/10, if not a 10/10.  
 
Character: 8/10 
 
The characters at the beginning were not very good. They were either incredibly dull, annoying, naive, or just plain idiotic. I kept watching though, hoping that they would learn something, and luckily they did... 30 episodes later. It just took far too long for these characters to learn anything. Once they do learn though, they become quite likable. The character development was very good, but it just took too long.  
 
One aspect of the first 30 episodes I loved, though, was how much trouble some of the characters had with killing. Far too often in anime you see young teens running out into the battlefield and start killing people without looking back, and they never really suffer for it. I congratulate the creators of Eureka Seven for their amazing job of bringing up this subject and pulling it off well.  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
 
The enjoyment in the first 25 or so episodes was fairly low. A few exciting things happened now and then and a character did something cool maybe once every 3-4 episodes, but that was it. Once all the major changes happened though and the story started moving, enjoyment shot straight up and I watched the last 20 or so episodes in one night. The first half of the anime gets maybe a 4/10, while the second half gets a 10/10. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
Even though every category individually gets a lower score, the overall effect of the anime deserves a 9/10. Being able to see how the characters have grown almost makes up for the 30 not-quite-so-good episodes. Almost. If I was rating just the last 20 episodes, I would easily give it a 10/10.  
 
In Closing:  
 
This is over all a very good anime, but it's one for people with patience who won't hold grudges for too long against the characters for doing something stupid, which they do. A lot. The series turned out amazing and lived up to its potential, if only for the last 20 episodes.

    MINOR SPOILERS 
 
Your name is a beautifully directed anime with amazing art and an average story line.  
 
Story/plot:7 
Makoto shinkai tried to direct and animate a very difficult concept, trying to fuse romance and sci-fi, so its no surprise it didn't do as well on this aspect. The story concept was interesting but there were a few plot holes relating mitsuha and takis relationship. Many users reviewing the movie say the story and plot is unoriginal and clique therefore the movie gets a 3/10, but many other films (anime or hollywood e.t.c) copy similar character stereotypes and it can still manage to be a good movie/anime, body swapping is a very wide range, and just because ""O i've seen Body swapping and time travel before therefore its a bad story, unoriginal and clique"" doesn't mean it has a bad story (iv'e seen more in depth reviews that explain why the story was bad, but the majority just say that one reason). 
 
Art 10/10 
The art is absolutely amazing, but people should stop comparing it to ghibli art because they both have different art styles so its very subjective. If you've seen the real photos (or if you've been to the real places) of the areas in the movie, you'll know that the art is surprisingly extremely accurate. Another thing I have to mention is the shading. Animation usually little to none shading because it would take extreme amounts of time to draw the frames or render. But your name paid attention to  lighting, shading and probably some even small details that just makes the movie seem a bit more real. 
 
Sound:9/10 
The soundtracks and sound were good just like any high budget movie. But the reason why I gave it a pretty high score was because everything the soundtracks seemed to fill up almost every important part and they also made certain themes for different places and characters , therefore enhancing the sadness and the drama. 
 
Character:8 
I feel that taki is the stronger character. He is the one who saved mitsuha anyways. Mitsuha was not a bad character, but she had less character development than taki. Taki was in more than half of the movie while mitsuha was dead, so that would explain why his character has the capacity yo develop more. The only character flaws I found were their unexpected romantic relationship, we are supposed to accept them liking each other without much actual physical interaction with each other. 
 
Enjoyment:10/10 
Even though the story had some issues, i still enjoyed myself greatly. It was a very emotional movie (makoto shinkai tends to focus on more of the emotional side) I don't usually like romantic movies but this one hit me hard, so that has got to say something.  
 
Overall: 9/10 
The story is the weakest aspect but it is covered up by amazing art and an emotions.

    Patlabor: The Movie 
 
This is a spoiler-free review. 
 
This movie is fantastic.  I first watched this film (and have rewatched it several times) without having seen the OVA's or the series it was based on.   
You are not required to be familiar with them to enjoy this excellent story as it is self-contained and firmly establishes its own universe. 
 
Produced in 1989 and set in what was the near future the story and plot holds up surprisingly well in the current digital and ultra-information age. 
 
Where are we going? 
Who are we?  
 
This film, set in a completely realistic hard science fiction world, casually explores these questions without metaphysical hocus-pocus, cybernetics, or the lofty notions of artificial intelligence which director Mamoru Oshii would later explore in the equally stellar Ghost in the Shell movies.  
 
Instead, we are treated to a good old-fashioned intrigue with noir/detective elements, a view into police life, a view of machines and computers as tools in our society, and how these very things can contribute to the loss of heritage and the memory of regional history as a trade off for the increasing speed of progress.    
 
Intelligent dialog between characters, corporate and police force politics, and a positive depiction of Section 2 as ""allies of justice"" instead of a run-of-the-mill cynical police force is a refreshing take on this pre-cursor to the often souped up fantasy mecha anime that emerged for the decade that followed this film.  
 
While there is plenty of subtext  and simple symbolism explored in an otherwise straight-forward plotline, the genius is in how the mysteries are solved and the ramifications to society is explored in a still-as-yet analog machine-centric world. 
 
The characters are real, warm, likeable, and believable as are the machines they use and pilot.  There are no quick-fixes as the story unfolds since humans still think, act and innovate in their environment and machines are simply tools that can be used for good or evil.  
 
The title sequences and ending moments may be action-packed, but all of it is driven by the scheming, thinking, and problem-solving characters rather than being a means unto itself.  
 
The animation holds up well, the sounds are surprisingly good but display the limited bandwidth in the era (and, I suspect, the budget for the genre at the time) and composer Kenji Kawai's musical score, while more dated than the rest of the film, serves to encompass and pay tribute to the analog nature of this film compared to it's digital successors that came afterwards.  
 
Make no mistake, this film's strength is in it's characters and plot and it's quite an enjoyable story.  High recommended.

    Violet Evergarden is an anime that plays too much on emotions instead of giving us a well written story and some substantial character development. It constantly relies too much on trying to get a tear off our eyes, although providing the quality of animation that I've been looking forward to. The detail put into the background, the character designs and the character movements are fluid and vibrant with such smoothness. It's well-executed and you can tell the animators put delicate care into its beauty. But with that said, when all is said in done, what VE truly couldn't achieve was an actual impactful ride. It has a great start. We're introduced to an auto memory doll, Violet Evergarden herself. She starts her own legacy without having to lean on the shoulder of her Commander, who is now no longer with her. That's where the downfall starts. The first 7 episodes are the building blocks of Violet Evergarden's personality. It is solely episodic, with each episode comprising of a story, one that is filled with supposedly emotion, containing scenes that want us to feel sorrow and sympathy. The show wants to make us sad, it wants us to feel for these characters. But, here's the thing. Each story is the length of an episode, meaning we have to feel some kind of attachment to the characters in that time span? Violet Evergarden is an auto memory doll, a messenger of sorts. Her duty is to carry out the words of those she's speaking on behalf of. The problem here is that we're supposed to feel bad for Violet Evergarden, not her clients, whom are the ones who are actually in trouble. Each scene is dedicated to her, focusing on her, giving attention to her. She is the spotlight all the time. And for some fucking reason, the people she helps always think of her as some savior, equivalent to that of Jesus Christ. That's the damn problem.  
 
Violet Evergarden is supposed to be this weak-willed character who we're supposed to love more as she gets released from the constraints of being a lonely servant, comprised of no sympathy, empathy, only laid out to kill. No one else is fit for that role. Actually, you're not supposed to be attached to any other character except the titular character herself. Which is surprising to say the least because she has the most linear and straightforward character development I've seen. The structure of the whole anime is linear, meaning it is very, very, VERY predictable. There is no surprise or shock value and the anime's attempts at it are just horrible. This applies to Violet Evergarden as well. She gets a personality instead of just being another empty robot and decides to act on her own will. Wow. Cool. The effort of watching the anime just to see the main character ""develop"" is just as disappointing as seeing the results. There is nothing memorable to Violet's character. Making an auto memory doll that establishes and grows emotions and free-will is a nice try but the praise and acknowledgement that surrounds this anime just because of Violet's vibrant character design and that she is an ""amazing character you always feel bad for"" is manipulative. Of course, you can't judge an anime based on its relevance, and I wasn't really involved with the hype to begin with. That said, Violet Evergarden is not that remarkable as a character. There are no projected traits that make her stand-out. Take away that gorgeous animation and you're left with a story that is as superficial as it is acclaimed from its fans. And a character who lacks a bit of substance. 
 
A shallow story. Beginning crisp with the echoes of a human's call for help. It commences the start of most episodes. It is delicately put together. It doesn't take risks. It is the home of predictability. You expect something sad, and it more or less happens. With certainty, the anime gradually drifts into something more appealing, Violet Evergarden as a person. In her past, serving as the soldier of her beloved Commander. Her past keeps her from revealing herself, from coming out and accepting who she is and to develop any kind of personality. Episodes 8-9 deal with her struggle to let go her fears. To let go of her past. She does so, of course, everything ends bright with her around. Although I did say she lacked any substance, that she was undeserving of the love she garnered from fans, I had to at least appreciate the care put into her development. There is a genuine intention that surrounds her actions and growth. The story is extremely shallow but Violet Evergarden herself is someone likable. Maybe not as engrossing as someone from Steins;Gate or Gankutsuou, but she does retain some attention from the viewer without ever getting boring.  
 
And that soundtrack. This anime's score is beautifully composed. Casting a net of elegance and serenity that encompasses the show, it is so well complimented with the beautiful animation. Very well refined and very well loved from me.  
 
Another thing to acknowledge are the last 3 episodes that concludes this show. It is abrupt and rushed. At this point I wasn't expecting much but still, oh how I wish the last arc was something at least better than just mediocre. But it is mediocre. The ending however is not. I think despite the poor story, the ending that ties up this controversial show is nicely put together and does not leave us with any sour taste on our mouths. And that, I can appreciate to some extent. 
 
In the end, this anime caught my attention. It stumbles along the way with freqeunt errors but I can appreciate that it's there. It does not deserve its high rating. The animation, score and sound design impressed me by a huge margin but that isn't as important as the core of what any wonderful anime should have. Characters you can invest in and a story you can love. It does not reach that peak. That said, I think this anime deserves a 6 from me. It's just... fine. And I can like it for what it is and not what it's made out to be.

    I really liked this one. After two episodes, I knew I was hooked. I love an anime with blood and gore, and this show delivered, but it gave a lot more, the story was well written and instead of just waiting to see someone get killed, I was actually really interested in this story, even more than usual. I enjoyed the thrill, the suspense, and the shock of finding out who died, who killed them, where, and why, and also seeing how the characters develop the mental state that drove them to murder. And the curse was the most interesting thing, with each time the story shifted, you get a little bit more information about it, which just added to the suspense. 
I'll admit that I got a little lost and confused and frustrated after like episode 5 (when the story reset for the first time), but then it started to make sense, and I liked how each of the story ""arcs"" showed the end, then showed how it got to that point, but also each arc was different, but connected to each other in the long run. What blew me away the most was how, like the end of the arcs were shown at the beginning of the arc, the very end of the series was connected to the beginning of the series in a way that I completely forgot about... BRILLIANT! 
 
I found out that there is another season, and I kinda hope they continue from where this one left off, but if it goes a different route, I'm still pretty excited to check it out. See you guys in the next season.

    If you liked the first 2 seasons slow pace and enjoyed the romance most, this season will come as a major disappointment. However, If you can keep up with the fast pace or just enjoy smart writing more than anything, this might be the greatest anime you've ever seen. 
 
The characters and intelligence is some of the best I've ever seen throughout all 3 seasons, and the music and art of this season specifically is also some of the greatest and a huge improvement from the last 2 seasons. 
 
 I don't want to say much about the story so I don't spoil anything (Remember when you spoiled Undertale for yourself), but I guarantee you'll be surprised, no matter how good your predicting ability is. 
 
The anime sneaks in some atheist hot takes. The main villain is called the God of creation, and the main hero (Shana) bares a striking resemblance to Lucifer. The show will point out the fallacies of this God's and other ideologies and gives you it's own, smarter takes on life. You'll enjoy Shakugan a lot more if you look for them 
 
I've heard alot of people say Shakugan's ending is their All-Time favorite but to me it just flies bye, better than most anime but disappointing for what you expect from Shakugan. 
    
     The major problem with this anime is that the type who would like it aren't the type to like the first 2 season, and vice versa. However,if one thing is for certain, this anime doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves.

    This series is so out there and wild that it drew me in really quickly. I liked the first three episodes (the prologue), but after we got into the first few after that, I was hooked, and that's mainly because of the comedy. This is one of the funniest series I've ever seen, along with Ouran, and I seriously laughed my butt off at it! After the comedy, the unique art is something else that pulls you in and gets you engrossed in it, and so is the main plot with the keishin. The voice acting was amazing and, to me from the shows I've seen, it's one of FUNimation's best dubbs.

    story 8/10 
 
the ""base"" story is not original, it is a heavily used idea that most people manage to mess up. however this is not a story line that does that, the overall story is very well made and it changes the idea of the the ghost human romance idea. it will keep you watching with anticipation as the story gets more and more interesting and ""intimate"". 
 
art 10/10 
 
the art work for this fits perfectly with what it was trying to achieve in the show. it has the feeling of both a serious anime and something that you could laugh at as if it were just a comedy. 
 
sound 9/10 
 
the sound fits great. the voices are perfect for the characters and the sound effects and music helped add the the comedy scenes as well as the suspense. 
 
character 10/10 
 
the characters are great it is what really shines in this anime. because of the way they were made you find yourself getting emotional attached to the characters. they also help to make the plot line as great as it is.  
 
enjoyment 10/10 
 
they is an anime that i liked so much and got into so much that i have watched this over 6 times now and i still think it is great.  
 
overall 10/10 
 
this is definitely something that i would recommend to someone to watch whether they like romance, comedy, mystery, or drama.

    I have no idea what a choujo is. 
 
The Choujo is an OVA adaptation of a one-shot by Takahashi Rumiko, the mangaka behind Inuyasha/Ranma/the rest.  It stars Maris, an alien with super strength who conveniently looks exactly like a normal human.  Because of her race’s strength, she finds herself constantly breaking things, throwing her into crippling debt.  Shenanigans and intense real-life legal battles ensue. 
 
I wouldn’t call it terrible, but I certainly wouldn’t call it good.  It’s mostly generic 80s space OVA with guitar solo ridden soundtrack.  There’s some cool bits, but a lot of the time it’s just hard to care about what’s happening because the main character doesn’t really garner sympathy.  It also has some out of place montages that are solely there to lengthen the runtime.  But there’s anime titties.  Thanks Studio Pierrot.

    I watched this anime over two days and let me start off by saying, don't watch all the episodes over a stretch of two days! 
It tackles some big issues in modern japan and how Satou goes through them. 
Even though alot of unfamiliar terms might pop up as you watch this series, you'll be very familiar with them by the end of the series if it's been subbed good. 
 
This anime kept giving you hope only to drag you down and make you depressed and this kept hapenning throughout the whole anime. 
I kept thinking &quot;ohh why don't you do that, or that Satou!&quot;. 
But having said that, alot of very interesting topics came up, and the reason I felt depressed was because you get very attached to the characters, and bad things keep happening to them. 
It's about how they react and deal with all these bad things that happen, and how they move on. 
 
The anime constantly surprised me, you never knew what was going to happen next! 
There are some very strong feelings involved, so be prepared before you watch it, it's really heavy. 
 
I can't really label what kind of genre it is, it doesn't stick to just one, it ventures between many different genres. 
 
All in all it's a great anime if you like very emotional animes.

    With this anime marks my 200th ANIME WATCHED, and if I were able to rate this an 11 out of 10, then I ABSOLUTELY would have! This is BY FAR the most hilarious and adorable rom/com school life anime that I have ever seen, and only after the first 4-5 episodes it was already my favorite. love OP and ED themes are SO GOOD, that i've been constantly humming or singing the songs since the 1st episode! I can't even stress this enough that this series is so FUNNY, ADORABLE, and the MC Takeo is just fantastic. I've found myself emotional and sometimes actually crying, not from just sadness or heartbreak, but for also the joy, comfort and closure that also comes with romance and relationships, and it's so unbelievably and beautifully told in this series. Not only is Takeo great as an MC, but him and his best friend Suna's bromance dynamic is so TOP TIER, it is so hilarious and heartfelt throughout the entire show. I find myself relating so much to not JUST the MC, but his best friend, and I see myself in both of them in various ways(put them together and you have ME. lol). Oh my gosh and Takeo's GIRLFRIEND THOUGH?!?! The moment I saw Rinko in the show it was like my heart was STRUCK with such cuteness and ADORABLENESS I CAN'T!!! Takeo's and Rinko's romance is so adroable, that I just couldn't NOT smile throughout the innocence the entire time. I also love this show because it deals with a lot of dynamics in love, whether it be romance, freindship, family, rejection, insecurties, unrequited love, love at first sight, and love that you just don't ever want to lose. The MC takeo's development also throughout the anime was phenomenal, from being a guy who never thought any girl would actually like him, and that the girls only flocked toward his best friend, to someone who would be there to fight for the one he loves at all cost. The romance in this anime is so good, including great development with side characters. You KNOW a series is fantastic, when side characters get some good development and then said characters and/or the couple and/or relationship between said characters become a staple in the main group of characters! 110% the best rom/com anime I have EVER watched. Everything was spot-on and well done, from the characters themselves, with all of their different relationships with others, to their dreams and the romance, comedy, innocence, and development of everything within the story was out of this world to me. If you have even THE SLIGHTEST interest in ROM/COM, school-life anime, then I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ANIME ENOUGH.

    [This review is for the Japanese version of Dragon Ball Kai.] 
 
DISCLAIMER: This is a review from the perspective of a ""first time watcher"" of the show. I read the manga when I was extremely young and, while watching the show, had very little memory of it save for the first two arcs. In short, I don't feel nostalgic about this show in the slightest. 
 
[Story – 6/10]: The storytelling of the show lacks some of the depth that I've come to expect from other series that I've watched. A villain that's stronger than the previous villain shows up, both the good guys and the villain power up several times, good guy eventually beats the villain, rinse and repeat. It's still enjoyable to a degree but leaves very little room for further analyzation. Everything is, more or less, exactly how it appears on the screen. 
 
[Art – 10/10]: Toriyama's character designs, as well as the style of animation, are something I enjoyed a lot. Everyone had a unique and interesting look about them. The older style of animation is also a breath of fresh air from modern animation which looks almost a little too artificial to me sometimes. 
 
[Sound – 3/10]: Sadly, this show suffers from Kenji Yamamoto and his plagiarism scandal. Not to mention that really none of the plagiarised soundtracks even stuck out to me that much in the first place. 
 
[Character – 7/10]: While not every character gets the same amount of care and attention, everyone is still interesting in their own way and I never found myself getting bored of the main cast. My only criticism is that the villains of the show are all essentially the same: powerful and evil. I've come to expect more depth from villains based on previous experiences and was sad to find it relatively lacking in this show. 
 
[Enjoyment – 8/10]: I binged half the show over the course of a few days and found myself often speculating on what was going to happen next. The show, despite its flaws with storytelling, is still a very enjoyable experience. 
 
[Overall – 7/10]: In conclusion, the flaws and strengths of this show balance each other out to create a decent, enjoyable viewing experience, even if much of the hype behind the show is propelled purely by the nostalgia of older viewers that grew up watching this.

    SUISEI NO GARGANTIA ANIME REVIEW 
Warning: Spoiler Alert! 
OVERALL: 9/10 
PLOT: 10/10 
I love the genre of this series. Except that it is a mecha anime, it is also a sci-fi one. An anime that is not only narrating the present situation, however, also is foretelling or showing a possible future state of a human. If it is kinda exaggerated, let us say it shows how human will possibly strive to live in the future. 
This story of this series focuses on a soldier boy which only learned how to fight. Without knowing the really reason for it. It revolves around this guy who make an escape and incidentally found himself on earth. Basically, we will found the beginning of the series where Ledo, which is the protagonist, along with Chamber, who is his machine, fight in the outerspace. Upon living on earth, they will learn a lot of things, humanity, caring for one another, how to live whatever the circumstances is, that killing people just because they are weak is not an option. As the story goes, the belief of Ledo will be challenge, a secret will be revealed and the need to choose from what you know is right and what you feel is right will take place. The people around him will strive to live, that are are differeny decision a human can take. Some will not go the way others believed in. That's how life it, literally. 
CHARACTER: 9/10 
The protagonist, Ledo, is strong. Well, it varies on the one who will watch this anime. It can be that the robot, Chamber, is the one who's strong, physically. However, Ledo is also strong? Independent in a way? And also kinda cute. Yes, he also decides something unappropriate. He also sometimes follow the rage of his heart. But that is what makes him a human. The decision a person makes, even if it contradicts the beliefs all his life, is hard. But he did. He made his mind rational to think correctly on what to do. The robot Chamber is also humane. Though he is a robot, you will never feel like it. 
ENJOYMENT: 9/10 
It's a great anime. If you're one of those people who also have interest in science or technology or cultural improvement and the like. You might wanna take this one into consideration. This anime has also a piece of comedy. A tragedy, for me. It's mind blowing? If you can appreciate it. You will come to think of ""What if?"" Or ""Is it possible?"" Or ""I wonder"". 
SOUND: 8/10 
I don't really have an interest on this part. Yes, I've been listening to opening and ending songs, OST and the like. It's because I love the rhythm. I love the voice. Though the voice actor and actresses, I don't really focuses into. I'm sorry for that. The voices of the character is fine for me. Same with the songs. 
ENDING: 9/10 
THIS, I HATE! I expected it but I don't want to watch it. I have a feeling that it will be coming, but nooo. I can't accept it. The ending is the best way to end the series, I think? I have no idea if there is a season 2 for this one. But I think, the ending answers all of the loopholes, as well as the scenario suited for the anime. Though, I am still against that one thing. Don't mind my rant. Hahaha.

    i will not talk much and get straight to the point.. i have recently started this anime and now i am in the middle of season 3. so far the story is great, the sound is awesome and the development of all characters is also going good except one i.e. our main protagonist ""takashi natsume"". at the start of  season 1, he was lame, uncool and scared by both humans and youkai. it is acceptable because of the life he had previously gone through before he knew about ""the book of friends"". but after time to time he faced many youkais good and bad and also interacted with different type of peoples so he should have improved and should have gotten his shit together but he is same as before till now. he dont know what should he do, whether to support human or youkai or both or none, he cant talk straight to anyone, scared of every little thing, and is like every other typical ridiculous MC where they boast about protecting the ""nakamas"" and shit and saving everyone while in reality the cant do a jack shit. this type of characters really pisses me off. man grow up. i would have given all 10 to this anime(not the art) if not for this MC.

well i lived this series so much that i think this is my most rewatched anime tieing with noucome, both noucome and mondaiji are 10 ep long anime series that i can only dream of waking up and finding out a second season is anounced watching a second season. even tho i dont enjoy the last 3 or 4 ep of monjaiji with the Pied Piper of Hamelin arch becouse it did not show as much izayoi's badassness as in the battle with Perseus community.  
 
if you have not seen this anime and have came upon this review then im just gonna recommend you to watch this anime its awesome.

    As someone who'd got no knowledge of the Macross 7 universe other than ""some dude flies the cooler Valkyrie from Macross Plus with a Guitar Hero controller,"" I decided the movie might be a fun place to start. 
 
Firstly, calling it a movie is not quite right. It's a slightly longer episode of the show, really. It stands pretty much alone, since although there are references to the rest of the series it doesn't presuppose too much knowledge and that which it does can be gained by inference. 
 
The plot is slight, and mostly an excuse for namedropping and a few awesome action scenes. The real star of the show is, of course, Basara and his music. The movie features some of the best songs from the series such as Heart and Soul, and it's  hard not to get some kind of response from the hugely entertaining guitar duel scene. 
 
I'd say that if you enjoy this movie, you'll probably enjoy the series itself. If you watch it and think ""that was stupid,"" then you probably won't.

The third Saint Seiya movie. The longer, complex (yes, complex) and better of the original movies. This one was so badass that, in my country (and ton of others too), it actually was showed in cinemas. With this one, the anime road was paved definitely. 
So, I hope you can understand my broken english, and learn about the Legend of Crimson Youth. 
 
Story: Abel, the Sun God (banished in the past by Apollo, apparently) comes back to the world with the intentions of human annihilation, so the gods may rule the world one again. This is original in the way that Abel want to rule with Athena, his sister, instead of just kill her and take the world for him. And guess what: Athena agrees, and tell the bronze saints that she doesn't need them anymore, since Abel not only have the Corona saints (Carina Atlas, Coma Berenice Berenike and Lynx Jaow), but the fallen golden saints too. Of course, Seiya doesn't take this calmly, but since Atlas clean the stairs with his head (a colorful way of kicking ass), Athena orders the four bronze saints to leave. Crushed with the decision of their goddess of... well, firing them, Seiya and co. eventually learn the truth: Athena didn't betrayed humanity, her plan was to beat Abel herself, since she doesn't want a fight between the saints and a powerful god (she apparently forgot that the saints are supposed to fight gods every now and then, specially Hades, since he come regularly). Athena obviously fails, and her soul is send straight to the Elysion. And that people, is the trigger for a battle between the bronze saints and the golden saints loyal to Athena vs. the Corona saints and the golden saints loyal to Abel. 
Enjoy the rest! 
 
Animation: Well, this time there is an improvement. Not mind blowing, but very significant. The environments (the temple look really nice, but I really like the little prairie were Abel and Athena first met), the attacks (flashier than ever, specially Atlas and Berenike's attacks), the animation (a bit more fluid) and the characters, everything is better done (comparing to the TV series and the other movies). 
 
Sound: the music is not only good, as usual... this time, they created and ending song!. You Are My Reason To Be (english lyrics, people!) isn't the best ballad ever, but is pretty nice, and is a good closure to a movie with tons of fights. 
The japanese voice acting is great, like always (you never get tired of the ""Saori-saaan"" scream over and over xD). 
 
Verdict: The best Saint Seiya movie so far. There's not only and improvement in the visuals, the story is better told, and the most important thing: we have more and better fights. The enemies this time are more satisfactory, the corona saints are really strong (and vile, their treacherous attacks are hilarious), and the golden saints are an excellent add (they aren't the more popular characters for nothing). And a few other things I can't comment for the spoiler thing. 
Oh, and I almost forgot, for crying loud sake, this one is 70 min long! This one qualifies as a real movie! (Truth to be told, the others are closer to OVAs) 
So, all in all, this is one of the best things with the Saint Seiya name on it. This is the way an anime movie should be done. 
-------- 
Amigos hispanoparlantes, ¿se acuerdan del primer opening que vimos de Saint Seiya? No Pegasus Fantasy, si no ese de “Los guardianes del uuuuuuuuuniverso al triunfar el maaaaaaaaaaaaal”? Bueno, ese tenía escenas (y spoilers masivos) de esta película. Esta es la número 3, la que vimos en cine los que tenemos más de 20 (la primera película de Anime que yo recuerdo...), y una de las responsables de cementar el fenómeno anime por estos lares, abriendo paso más tarde, al menos en Argentina, a futuras incursiones como Dragon Ball... 
Señores, señoras, con ustedes, Los Caballeros del Zodiaco Contraatacan (Latinoamérica) o La leyenda de los jóvenes escarlata (España... este nombre me gusta más. Bien por los españoles). 
 
Historia: Abel, Dios del Sol (o al menos uno de los dioses del sol, dado que en el pasado fue vencido y desterrado por Apolo), regresa al mundo de los humanos con la intención de eliminar a la humanidad y empezar una nueva época donde los dioses dominen la tierra. Esto es ciertamente original, dado que Abel quiere reinar el mundo junto a su hermana Athena, en lugar de simplemente borrarla del mapa y regir solo. Y acá esta el giro: Athena acepta, y releva a los santos de bronce de sus puestos, dado que Abel no solo cuenta con sus santos de la corona (Atlas del signo de Carina, Jaō del signo de Lince y Belenger del signo de Coma Berenices), sino que también revivió a los santos de oro caídos. Obvio que Seiya no toma esto muy bien, pero después de que Atlas le diera una paliza, Athena ordena a los cuatro caballeros de bronce presentes que se retiren. Devastados por haber sido abandonados por su diosa, Seiya y compañía terminan descubriendo la verdad: Athena no estaba realmente dispuesta a abandonar a la humanidad, pero no quería que sus caballeros lucharan contra algo tan poderoso como un dios (se ve que no le llego el memo de que se supone que los santos SI pelean contra los dioses, especialmente contra Hades, que viene cada 242 años aproximadamente), por lo que se enfrenta a su hermano, obviamente perdiendo, y siendo su alma enviada a los campos Eliseos. Así es como se desata la batalla entre los santos de bronce y los de oro leales a Athena vs los santos de la corona y los santos de oro leales a Abel. 
 
Animación: Bueno, esta vez realmente se nota un esfuerzo por parte de los animadores. No voy a decir que fue un salto gigantesco en la calidad, pero tanto el entorno (especialmente al principio de la película, cuando Athena y Abel se encuentran en ese campo floreado tan bonito), los ataques (aplauso para los ataques de Atlas y Belenger!), la animación y los personajes están mejor hechos que en la serie o en las otras películas. Será porque está realmente es una película (podríamos decir que las otras tres eran más bien OVAS). 
 
Sonido: La música no solo es buena, si no que esta vez, crearon un ending para la película!. You Are My Reason To Be (cantada en ingles) no será la balada más brillante del mundo, pero es agradable y da un buen cierre a una película donde llovieron golpes por todos lados. En cuanto al doblaje... la versión latina (al menos la que yo vi, porque apostaría que hay una versión mas) contaba con un cambio total en las voces. Excepto por la de Shun, que sonaba medio rara, todas eran correctas (especialmente la de Seiya, que tenía que competir con alguien como Jesús Barrero). También, hay alguna que otra cosa peculiar, como que al caballero de Acuario le digan Camil en lugar de Camus, y que al ataque ofensivo de Ikki le hayan metido la palabra fantasma (el puño fantasma del fénix es el que destruía cerebros, no el que destruía huesos), pero nada grave (ahora que me acuerdo bien, varios ataques tenían cambios menores de nombre).  
 
Veredicto: Esta es la mejor película de Saint Seiya hasta el momento. No solo hay un aumento en calidad técnica, la historia está mejor planteada (sin salirse de lo tradicional), y lo más importante de todo: más y mejores peleas. Los enemigos esta vez son mucho más satisfactorios, los santos de la corona dan mucha batalla (y son rastreros como pocos, atacando por la espalda a diestra y siniestra), y la inclusión de los caballeros de oro fue genial (no por nada son los personajes más populares de la serie... aunque, por alguna razón, los que estaban vivos no aparecieron). Además de muchas cosas más que no puedo comentar por cuestiones de spoilers. En resumen, esto es de lo mejor que hay con el nombre de Saint Seiya. Así es como deberían ser las películas de un anime.

    The story was cute yet simple. It didn't need any dramatic scenes for it to be interesting and that's what made the movie so perfect.  
 
The animation was so pleasing to the eyes and it's one of the reasons why I fell in love with the anime. 
 
Kusakabe and Sajou's lovestory was so heartwarming and adorable I was legit squealing every time they kissed.  
 
Not only that but the music was a great touch to the movie and it fit into the scenes so well. 
 
Overall, I recommend to anyone who just wants a feel-good movie in which the characters and deeply in love with each other.

    Having watched The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Summer Wars, it was a no-brainer that I'd check out Hosoda's next animated feature Wolf Children.  It's great to see Hosoda's style developing through his works and Wolf Children does a great job of combining elements from his previous films. 
 
Story: 8 
The story is set up beautifully.  It is told through Yuki (one of the children) as the narrator who has lived through the events of the story and has learned stories from her mother.  The story has some minor pacing issues with a sudden time skip, but this doesn't throw off the experience in the long run.  The concept is also well done considering the slightly ludicrous premise and doesn't stray into Twilight territory with the romance, instead focusing on the lives of the children. 
 
Art: 9 
Hosoda's style is still great to watch.  Characters are drawn simplistically against gorgeous backgrounds.  The character designs are great as well and watching Ame and Yuki transform from humans to wolves and vice-versa is both adorable and uniquely cool.  The only slight detractor is the use of cg for background characters in the beginning as they look too fluid, but they are only present in the first 20 or so minutes and from then on everything is beautiful. 
 
Sound: 9 
I watched the English dub for this movie and it's one of the better dubs I've seen.  Nothing is lost in translation and voice acting is spot on.  I particularly liked Yuki's cute voice as a child and old man Nirasaki's gruff voice fits perfectly.  The soundtrack fits the film well and has its moments to shine, but overall it's pretty average. 
 
Characters: 10 
The characters in this movie are all awesome.  Hana is the best mom on the planet and an incredibly likable main character who develops as she learns how to raise her kids.  Ame and Yuki are fun to watch at the beginning and become more complex as they decide who/what they want to be.  Although mere side characters, all of the villagers are portrayed with heart and their warmness gives a positive human outlook to the story. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
This movie is a treat to watch.  It seems it was aimed at neither kids nor adults and it could easily please both.  As my girlfriend and I felt, you'll likely feel as though you were watching it for hours as you are engrossed into the lives of this odd family, yet it will still leave you wanting more. 
 
Overall: 9 
With the combination of a supernatural love story and an endearing family drama, Hosoda combines elements from The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Summer Wars to make a unique and wonderful film that is a must-watch for Hosoda fans and anime fans as a whole.

    Behind the cuteness and simplicity lies a strong bond between a father and ""daughter"". 
 
Anime dealing with various themes about actual reality are rare. Most of the time, we get a semi-realistic settings that does not manage to capture the feeling of living in a real world.  
Usagi Drop is one of those rare shows that really touch upon the real world scenario, bringing up one of the most complicated times in ones life; raising a child. 
 
To put it simply, Usagi Drop follows the story of Daikichi, a 30 year old salesman who adopts Rin, the illegitimate child of his grandfather. 
 
It may sound like a simple slice of life about an adult raising a child (and it is) but it's how that said adult deals with the act and actions that really makes the show shine. From Daikichi's point of view, we see how he raises up his adopted daughter, shifting his job, attending gatherings and mingling with other parents. As someone who has never raised a child and lacking in knowledge, one can truly see Daikichi's inexperience during conversations and interacting with the people he never really expected to talk and relate to. Of course, as the show progresses, so does his development, being one of the main highlight of the series. You get to see how Daikichi gets a hand of things from simplistic ones like enrolling and fetching Rin from a daycare to more pressing issues like changing the sheets after a case of ""child night bedsheet wetting"". He develops from this inexperienced, young adult to a loving, caring father. 
 
Furthering the show's charm is none other than Rin herself. Most people would find kids to be annoying crybabies who run around only to hurt themselves and cry some more. Rin is not that kind of kid. Sure, there's quite a characterization to make her stand out but it's that very same characterization that makes her just fun to watch. Her carefree and up-ish attitude is more enjoyable than annoying. Watching her interact and move about innocently feels very warming and smile-worthy. Like seeing two young toddlers, a boy and a girl, promise to get married sometime in the future. 
 
Backing up the show is a unique and simple art style involving pastels and light colors, very fitting for a series such as this. The character designs are quite neat and the backgrounds are light and beautifully drawn. Both aspects just balance well and are pleasing to the eyes, making the show much more relaxed, of course, as a compliment. 
This is all accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack consisting of xylophones, pianos and violins to bring about musical emotion and serenity to the scenes. It's all so simple yet so... elegant and heartwarming. 
 
A heartfelt and relaxing watch. 
A show that tells and shows the happiness and difficulty about raising a child isn't really aimed at ""regular"" audience, but it makes for a good change of pace from all the cliche action shows you see everywhere these days.

    Action junkies will find Bakemonogatari lacking. But I've been expanding my palette and this satisfied on all levels. It contains several interesting and diverse characters and a plot that focuses on the emotional motivation behind the supernatural events rather than battling the monster of the week. The art is great and surreal, giving atmosphere to this supernatural tale. It's smart and complex and for a more mature audience which was what I was looking for when I started watching it. 
I have one overt complaint that though. That is the tremendous volume of text in this series. It's already subtitled so I have to read the dialogue but then there's screenshots of text that even someone who reads as fast as I do struggled to keep up. Towards the end I wished I was watching it dubbed so i could read the text and see how it matters to the plot and story. I know that seems a small thing but those who struggle with reading might be intimidated by this series.  
But not everything needs to be going mach two with your hair on fire; so if you're looking for a supernatural thriller that's not excessively gory, or violent or misogynistic then I highly recommend Bakemonogatari.

    One of the best aspects of this anime is its personal theme of freedom. In one episode of the anime the character Mugen states ""I don't wanna be the ruler or the ruled. I believe in me and what I can do."" Most people think of freedom as being able to do whatever you want, but this anime shows there's much more to freedom than this.  
 
Freedom also means being free from things such as religious persecution, racism, homophobia, ableism (prejudice against those with disabilities), senseless violence, and so on. Then there is being free from personal demons.  
 
Many secondary characters in this anime deal with one of the former, while the main characters deal with the latter. Through the main characters, the anime also does a good job of showing how society's problems can create different personal problems for individuals.  
 
Speaking of the main characters, each has their own merits. Mugen has women and drinking as his vices as well as a shady past, but he has a cool fighting style based on break dancing and samarai sword fighting and a nice personal style that is reminiscent of hip-hop culture. He has the most striking character development as he confronts his past and learns to care about more than just fighting.  
 
At first, Jin is the stoic and deadly samurai that most people expect samurai to be. He has movng character development similar to Mugen, except with a tiny bit more humor. Finally, Fuu is a naive yet compassionate and clever girl. Although I wish she could have learned self-defense, her character development is just as touching as Mugen and Jin's, especially as she meets certain people and confronts her past. 
 
Another great aspect of the anime is how it blends past and future cultures together to show oppressive authorities and dire personal circumstances result in cultural movements. The future culture of hip-hop (i.e. graffiti, break dancing, rapping) into the past culture of the Japanese samurais is a very creative feat shown through secondary characters the viewer encounters and through the main character Mugen. There is another notable blend in one episode involving break dancing, samurai fighting styles, a certain sport, and two countries, but you'll have to watch to see what I mean. 
 
Final notable aspects of the anime include the soundtrack and the animation. The soundtrack is a blend of hip-hop and traditional Japanese music and another example of the past and future culture blending mentioned earlier. The animation seems to be inspired by traditional Japanese drawings and paintings and is very well done, but there are a couple times it gets a weird modern psychedelic tinge. 
 
The only flaw is one episode that seemed totally out of place with the others. It had to be the weirdest filler episode I have ever seen.  
 
In spite of a little bit of weirdness, this was a fantastic anime. I recommend it to those who enjoy action-adventure samurai animes and anyone who enjoys hip-hop culture. I wouldn't recommend this to younger audiences due to the strong violence, drug and alcohol use, and sexual situations.

    This was a great pick me up when I was feeling down, I don't normally like slice of life stuff but I related to the main character a lot. To be honest it wasn't what I was expecting going in, i thought there would be more psychological and trippy stuff but there wasn't. It was endearing though, with a few cringe moments. It didn't feel to short and ended just when I was ready to stop watching.

    *This review contains no spoilers* 
 
I have been putting off on this anime for years, and I finally got the time to cram all of the episodes. I have to say, this is a rather... unique anime. It is one of the better romance animes while still being unoriginal. It bears many resemblances to other anime but overall provides an enjoyable romantic comedy experience. 
 
Story: 5 
 
No doubt here that this is definitely the weakest point of this anime. The story uses many cliches, including: 
 
-Childhood Promise 
-Harem of girls 
-The main girl being a blonde half-Japanese 
-Shy girl in harem with a ""partner"" who pushes them into awkward situations 
 
The list goes on and on... But somehow this anime manages to make these cliches into a uniquely enjoyable anime experience. 
 
Art: 10 
 
Not much to say here. The art looks beautiful, as expected from a modern anime from a relatively popular company. The art resembles a more rounded version of Bakemonogatari. In fact, much of the anime resembles Bakemonogatari in a way except for the story. The video cuts are similar to Bakemonogatari and the romances of the 2 main characters resemble each other. Still, it is a lovely art style that is to be expected. I have to admit, it was very heartwarming watching the emotional evolution of Chitoge and Raku. 
 
Sound: 10 
 
Very well designed soundtrack. if nothing else, this soundtrack is a very appealing one that shoudl nake any consider this anime as an option. The openings and endings are catchy (still resembling the style of Bakemonogatari), and the sad music really immerses you into this fictional world. 
 
Characters: 9 
 
The characters are well-designed, except for the fact that they aren't very unique. The characters still very much resemble the characters from Bakemonogatari (except for maybe one but revealing who that is would be a spoiler). In fact, the name Onodera Kosaki resembles a name from Bakemonogatari. The characters are funny, though, and they really do make this into an enjoyable experience.  
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
Definitely what pulls this anime through is its enjoyment. This is not much of an extreme ride, but it is very enjoyable, and the gradual realizations and relevations throughout the story make this one of the best and most suspenseful, but also one of teh most relaxing anime of the recent years. 
 
Overall: 10 
 
I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for a good rom-com anime, or a good relaxing anime. I enjoyed it a lot. 
 
(BTW would definitely recomment listening to CLICK and STEP by ClariS, as well as Recover Decoration by Kana Hanazawa, because they are really relaxing catchy songs that are fun to sing along to.)

    I feel compelled to write a review for this hot steamer. Perhaps this is because of the hype train this thing SOMEHOW managed to conjure up. This is really just so I can get this off my chest, but I will be breaking this thing down by each category.  For your sake, stop now. What lies ahead is not a pretty sight.  
 
All you need to know is this:  
 
Overall: (2/10) 
 
Are you still here? You're a brave soul... I hope you're ready for this. 
 
Let's get the ""good"" stuff out of the way first. 
 
Art: (6/10) 
 
The artwork is at its best during the battle scenes. It's not bad. It's not fantastic. You look at it and you think ""Oh! those are pretty colors,"" then you forget about it. It doesn't do anything to enhance the atmosphere. It's there simply for you to gawk at. 
 
Sound: (6/10) 
 
Just like with the animation, the sound direction is fairly average. It's not bad. It's not fantastic. It's just there when it needs to be. There isn't anything particularly memorable about it. There was never a moment where I thought ""Wow this music is really powerful!"" It serves its purpose. 
 
Okay, well that just about sums up the ""positives."" Now we can move on to the fun stuff. 
 
Story: (2/10) 
 
The first two episodes of this show are actually good. It does a good job of setting up the whole ""you're stuck in a video game"" idea, and the boss fight is exciting. It's after this point where the entire show falls apart. Basically, the writers told us we were getting cake, but little did we know the filling was made from regurgitated feces. You take that first bite and you think ""Oooh that's some yummy frosting!"" But by the time you get into the meat of it, it's too late. The plot from here on can be summed up as a harem anime. You thought you were getting a cool action show. Instead you get incoherent time skips, filler episodes, forced cheesy romance, fan-service, and a tentacle monster. 
 
Characters: (1/10) 
 
You thought the plot sounds bad? The characters are detestably cliche. The main protagonist, Kirito, is unstoppable. He's the best at everything. He never loses. He has zero depth, and due to all the time skipping the viewer is not allowed to grow with the character at all. One episode ends in one place, and in the next you have no idea what is going on. You feel like you've missed dozens of episodes worth of character development. It's infuriating. 
 
Asuna isn't any better really. She exists solely for the purpose of serving Kirito and contributes nothing beyond that. All of the side characters and villains aren't even worth remembering because they are completely insignificant. 
 
Enjoyment: (2/10) 
 
At this point, I don't really need to explain how much I ""enjoyed"" this do I? Maybe if you haven't had any time to develop your taste, you may like this show for the setting and animation. But that's a huge stretch. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The most surprising thing to me is how popular this show is. It's immense... I just don't get it. My friends love it... and I feel like a jerk when I tell them how awful it is. Am I a bad person for thinking it deserves only contempt? For me, the absolute worst part about it is how the anime community makes me feel like I am in the wrong, when I know just how loathsome it is. It just makes me feel totally crazy.

    Well Finally Finished both Neon Genesis Evangelion and End of Evangalion. Damn i don't really do not know what to think. 
 
It is impressive to be sure...especially for something that came out over 20 years ago. but the sheer amount of controversial messages and images within it are just Wow...no wonder this has so much infamous even after all this time that has passed i can see what it is a must see for any anime fan.  
 
However that does not mean it is perfect especially production wise...the last few episodes of the tv series are so... mismatched to say the least...u can practically skip the last two and go for the movie which is the real ending..and than the story there is still so much questions to be asked and few gaps that needed to be answered. 
 
Sure it may have been intention to force you the viewer to make your own interpretation but they could have given us a bit more information about the whole thing. So bottom line i would give the Tv series 8/10 and the movie a 9/10 
 
As for the New Evangelion movies which are reboot as well as going further past the story where the original conclusion ended...i have yet to watch them for the following reasons: 
 
1: I need some time to absorb what i just saw in the original series so that way when i watch the new movies i will be able to make a good comparison between the two. 
 
2: it would be to much trouble to watch them after this..as i would feel like i am repeating myself again...not good when u just watching the first..so i need some time so when i watch it ..i wont be so fatigued and enjoy them more. 
3. it is not concluded.....i rather wait for the last movie (good god whenever that will be released) so i can watch it all in one go..and won't be just stuck in a cliffhanger...i guess i can count my fortunes i waited this long to watch the original so i did not have to suffer the long wait in gaps between the releases... a little cruel for those who have been waiting longer but it is a fact so it can't be helped sorry guys. 
Bottom line: I think you really should watch NGE if u have not yet ..especially for it's controversial themes as well as it's lasting cultural impact it made for the anime community in general...as well as if u are a Mech fan but that much has been said already XD.

    This Anime was like a wonderful desert that was rotten on the inside, deeply deeply rotten.  
 
The premise of a modern military up against a fantasy military, is rock solid fun, If you like fiction like Turtledoves road not taken,  Mary Gentle's Grunts, Stirling's March Up Country. or Anderson's High Crusade.  You will really enjoy the first 6 episodes. It's really great military/violence porn. 
 
Even while the story is at it's best you can still see problems. In the opening episode you have Roman type cavalry and infantry mounting a mass attack on downtown Tokyo. If you think about it, it's completely ridiculous. It improves after that but then goes way down hill. As the author tries to bring in real world geopolitics he handles it very poorly. The other nations are little more than straw men. You also start to see the lazy writing that characterizes the 2nd season.  
 
The last big problem with the first season is that it ends not on a cliff hanger, but just suddenly without resolving anything.  This also happens with the second season but it's not as big a problem as you just don't GAF anymore. 
 
Final Verdict: The first season on it's own is about 5 and disappointing because it could have been better. But there is a second season that you pretty much will be sucked into , and that brings it all down to a 3.

    Haikyuu's second season continues with its excellent high-quality storytelling that made many fall in love with the first season. While Haikyuu is most certainly a sports anime at its core, it's also an extremely well-crafted tale of the trials and hard work that every player goes through. Most importantly, Haikyuu makes you actually care about what happens in the show. Whether it's a loss or a victory, Hinata or a player on the opposing school's volleyball team, the show manages to grasp us as viewers and force us to invest heavily in the fictional world of Haikyuu. 
 
With most sports anime, the pacing of the story is hard to bear. In some shows, a match can last nearly half a season. With Haikyuu, it never felt this way. Each episode had a succinct amount of storytelling and the pacing was perfect. From the training camps they attended, to the matches that were played, every episode was a thrilling ride that always managed to be satisfying. One of Haikyuu's biggest strengths is how it properly sets up each story arc with the necessary back stories to each character. This type of information provided is exactly why this show is so good. It gives you the “why should you care” for nearly every aspect of the show. Haikyuu also mixes the elements of a story masterfully. Comedy, action, shounen, it's all there and perfectly balanced. Comedy was put in at the right times and had me rolling on the floor on more than one occasion. The action is thrilling in the big matches and the shounen aspect of “improving” is so engraved in the viewer, it just feels so good to root for Karasuno.  The attention to detail in the story is by far one of the best of any shows I've seen and it truly makes for a great watching experience.  
 
Production I.G has done a great job with the animation for Haikyuu. The animation quality is top-notch and most importantly, consistent. In fast-paced action scenes, the animation becomes incredibly intense, but it's very well done and gives a much needed “oomph” for climaxes in the story. Character design is varied and unique as well. Far too often in other anime shows, the characters all look alike. Haikyuu does not experience this with its large cast of characters that are appealing and uniquely designed. 
 
Haikyuu's voice acting, background music and OST are, like the rest of the show, great. The OP and ED are fitting for the theme of the show. The background music in scenes are also utilized very well. Some other shows try to force insert songs in scenes that do not fit well but Haikyuu does not suffer from this. Haikyuu's OST is near perfect and manages to help emphasize the emotions experienced in the show. Google Haikyuu's OST and prepare to be blown away (or just listen to it while watching).  
 
The characters of Haikyuu are most definitely its strongest point. I briefly mentioned this earlier, but Haikyuu fully develops each character in the show. The characters all grow throughout the series. None of them are 'perfect' from the start and altogether gives it a certain type of realism. Most people like to root for the underdogs and that's essentially the same feeling you get from Haikyuu. There is no 'Gary Stu' as each person has their strengths and weaknesses. Even the seemingly perfect Oikawa Tooru has his own weaknesses in that he is not a 'prodigy' but someone who worked his way up. I also appreciated that each character in the show has an impact. For example, Yachi, the manager, is not someone who just stands on the sidelines cheering Karasuno on. Haikyuu shows you her back story as well as her perspective. This greatly adds to the storytelling and to her character in general. Same goes for Tsukishima. His backstory is fleshed out and tells us why he acts the way he does. Each character is important to the overall story and is truly a 'cog in the machine' for Haikyuu. 
 
My initial thoughts upon seeing the preview for the first season of Haikyuu is that I couldn't possibly find volleyball interesting. Now, 50 episodes later, I can't fathom how I'm going to wait for the third season. Haikyuu is not 'perfect' and of course has certain elements like 'they can't be losing all the time' armor plot. But again, Haikyuu is a fictional anime with the sole purpose of entertaining you. In this case, it is very much about the journey, not the destination. If you only care to look at the small conveniences that a story may take, you'll miss out on everything else that makes it great. For me, Haikyuu was an enjoyable show that I looked forward to watching every Sunday. With fully developed characters that you can care about, a great OST and masterful storytelling, Haikyuu is worth your time as it is an excellent example of just how entertaining anime can be.

    Kissxsis, a story about 2 older sisters wanting to marry and fuck their younger brother, yet it is possibly the greatest ecchi anime in existence.  Why? Because it doesn't follow any generic harm cliches and how natural the characters interact with each other. ( spoiler free) (Important to enjoy the show fresh) 
 
 
This is probably the only anime that portrayed incest in a delightful enjoyable way. For an ecchi anime it surprisingly doesn't have much nudity. Instead of a panty shots or a "" guy walk in to girl dressing situation""   Kissxsis generates erotic scenes out of everyday objects and situations that seems so natural and ordinary.  Instead of presenting a nudity ecchi scene like any other generic harm ecchi anime would, Kissxsis would let the viewer's imagination decide instead. Thus as a result creating some of the most erotic and memorable scenes in ecchi history, depending on how dirty your mind is. 
 
The  director captures the dirty mind of a teenager boy very well and just how they want to ""see"" their sisters interact with those ""objects"". 
 
This show also have a few side characters who also get into ecchi situations with Keita honourable mention ( the teacher and that glasses chick with big boobs) however I always hoped they would just gtfo as soon as possible since the sisters are just much better and cuter. 
 
In a nutshell, kissxsis presented the brother on sister relationship very sincerely. The incest does not feel forced and their love appears very genuine. The erotic scenes are top-notch in terms of ""arousing"" quality, honestly better than most hentais that have actual sex scenes lmao. 
 
If you are a fan of hentai or ecchi genre, Kissxsis is a MUST watch! These 12 episode went flying for me and still begging for more.

    Despite the art being like the storyline, pretty boring and generic, this season was after all better than the first one. 
 
This season, I found myself disliking the protagonists of the show and did not care much at the end if they'd survive or not. I see nearly 0 character development and all the characters in the show seem very flat and uninteresting with the exception of Shinoa and Mitsuba, having somewhat of a background worth thinking about. They all kept speaking and acting in this very obvious (sometimes obnoxious) and specific way which kept the story very uninteresting and predictable.  
 
Secondly, the plot does not make any sense from time to time. Some characters act very unrealistically. Like, there are multiple characters who frequently keeps disobeying the commands but are yet still allowed to participate in the battle (You can guess who). You are given no sense of time elapses and the plot overall was just confusing and a big mess with major plot holes. 
 
Sadly, I did not notice any great musical performance. The music, very much like everything else, was very generic and basic. Not bad but nothing out of the ordinary. 
 
The art though is very consistent but was in my opinion, very boring to look at. Very few shots with extraordinary art (If any?) and it all looked a bit childish at times so I found it hard to take some scenes seriously but that could've been that it was just me being not very fond of the art style. But as I said, no weird frames and everything looked like it was supposed to, I guess. 
 
So was this season worth it? Yes, if you managed to get through the first one this one is way better but still not very top notch. After reading all this I do realise it sounds like I didn't enjoy the show at all but I really did. Overall, it was good and I'd watch another season if there would come one but this isn't an anime you'd discuss for months with others.
